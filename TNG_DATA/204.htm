CARMEN: The hospital facility will be located there, facing north in
that grove of trees. And the school and the arts centre
will be standing there, centrally located among the residential pods. <br>
RIKER: Very good. At this rate we'll be able to bring the next wave of
colonists in in about six months. I've to tell you I envy you. This is
a beautiful place to put down roots. <br>
CARMEN: Somehow, Riker, you don't strike me as the kind that puts down
roots. <br>
RIKER: No? How do I strike you? <br>
CARMEN: As a free spirit. An adventurer. <br>
RIKER: An adventurer? Aren't you pioneers adventurers at heart? <br>
CARMEN: Of course. But we also have this nesting instinct. It's
exciting to find a new world but the joy comes in making it
a home. Building houses, having children. <br>
RIKER: Very interesting. I'd love to discuss this further with you.
Dinner tonight? <br>
CARMEN: If you want to share camp rations in my tent, I'd be delighted.
<br>
RIKER: Haven't we gotten you a replicator yet? <br>
CARMEN: No, we haven't, but I've been saving my ration of dried chicken
curry. It should go very nicely with that bottle of wine I happen to
know you brought with you. <br>
RIKER: This is sounding better all the time. <br>
CARMEN: And as you know, I provide the most memorable desserts. <br>
RIKER: My favourite part of dinner. <br>
CRUSHER: Will? Carmen? We've been going over the schematics for the
hospital. The location seems fine. <br>
RIKER: When the Enterprise comes back tomorrow, we'll get a crew
started on that. <br>

RIKER: Carmen, have you got construction started I didn't know about? <br>
CARMEN: No. What is that? <br>
RIKER: Data? <br>
DATA: I do not recognise the sound. I believe it is coming from above. <br>
(something passes in front of the sun and the wind picks up) <br>
CARMEN: Will, what is it? <br>
RIKER: Data, what's our best bet for cover? <br>
DATA: Subterranean caverns to the east, sir. Doctor. <br>

CARMEN: Will. <br>
RIKER: Start gathering everybody together. We've seen this before. We
know what it is. Now get moving. <br>

RIKER: Follow him. Let's go! Come on, come on! <br>
(Riker brings up the rear of the column. The entity sends out a beam
that destroys a swathe of grass and a tree. Data leads them over a
ridge.) <br>
RIKER: No, stay together! Stay together! This way! This way! This way! <br>

WORF: I cannot tell. We are still too far away. It could be an
electrical storm. <br>
PICARD: See if you can contact the colony. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. Captain, there is no response from Melona colony, but
the disturbance in the atmosphere is increasing. <br>

Deeper into the cave. Keep moving. <br>

RIKER: How much protection will this cave give us? <br>
DATA: The refractory metal in the rock formations may act as an
effective barrier. <br>
RIKER: Let's seal off this entrance. <br>

ray) <br>
CRUSHER: Let's hope there's enough air in here. <br>
RIKER: There's got to be a ventilation source somewhere. We need some
light. <br>
(the devastation can be heard going on outside as Riker and Data use
the phasers to make the ceiling glow) <br>
RIKER: How are the others? <br>
CRUSHER: Just scrapes and bruises, I think. I'll check further. Where's
Carmen? <br>
RIKER: She didn't make it. She was trying to save an old man who'd
fallen. <br>
CRUSHER: I'm sorry. <br>
RIKER: I think we're going to be all right in here. I'm not sure about
the air supply, so stay put, don't move around. Don't expend
unnecessary energy. With any luck, we'll be able to wait this thing
out. <br>
RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. Riker to Enterprise. <br>

Marr, a xenologist who has made studying the Entity her life's work.

RIKER: Welcome to the Enterprise. I am Commander William Riker. <br>
MARR: Commander, Doctor Kila Marr. <br>
RIKER: Glad you're here. <br>
MARR: You were on the surface during the attack? <br>
RIKER: That's right. <br>
MARR: Remarkable. You and your group are the only known beings ever to
survive an assault by the Crystalline Entity. <br>
RIKER: We were lucky. <br>
MARR: I should say. And your android. He was there, too? <br>
RIKER: Lieutenant Commander Data was there, yes. <br>
MARR: Well, shall we get started? <br>
RIKER: I'd be glad to show you to your quarters. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARR: Oh, Commander. A chance to talk to survivors
so soon after an attack? I've been waiting years for this. I don't want
to waste a moment more.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Observation lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: And when we came out of the cave there was
nothing left. Everywhere we looked there was complete devastation.
Trees gone, nothing. <br>
MARR: That's typical. It could take years for anything to grow again. <br>
DATA: Doctor, I ran a full spectrographic analysis, section by section.
Trace elements confirm that it is the same entity which destroyed the
colony at Omicron Theta. <br>
MARR: The Crystalline Entity seems to function like a gigantic
electromagnetic collector. It needs a lot of power to keep going so it
strips every form of life from the worlds it encounters and converts it
all into energy. <br>
RIKER: There's no vegetation, no insects, not even soil bacteria. It
left nothing. <br>
MARR: Except witnesses, for the first time in eleven recorded attacks.
Now why, I wonder, did it spare your group? <br>
RIKER: It didn't spare everyone, Doctor. If you'll check your reports,
you'll find that two of the colonists didn't survive. <br>
MARR: My point is that until now there have never been any survivors. <br>
DATA: Doctor, the cave in which we hid was made of rock which contained
heavy concentrations of kelbonite and fistrium. We surmise that the
Entity was unable to penetrate that barrier. <br>
MARR: I would like to do interviews with each of the survivors. Collect
as much specific detail as I can of their observations. <br>
PICARD: Of course. <br>
MARR: And I'd like to inspect the remains of Melona Colony as soon as
possible. <br>
PICARD: Commander Data, you will accompany the Doctor to the surface. <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. <br>
MARR: If you don't mind, Captain, I prefer to choose my own team. <br>
PICARD: Doctor, there is no one on this ship with more knowledge of the
Crystalline Entity than Commander Data. He originated on Omicron Theta.
<br>
MARR: I am aware of his origins. I'm very much aware that his brother,
Lore, worked with the Crystalline Entity, led it to Omicron Theta where
it killed every living thing. I don't think it's unreasonable that I
should prefer to make another choice. <br>
PICARD: You may request additional team members, but in the best
interest of this investigation, I think you should work with Commander
Data. <br>
MARR: As you wish, Captain. <br>
(Marr, Riker and Data leave) <br>
PICARD: Well? <br>
TROI: I don't think you need an empath to sense that woman's feelings.
There's hostility that she seems to have transferred from Lore to Data.
Perhaps you shouldn't have forced them together so soon. <br>
PICARD: If her discomfort is going to affect her judgement or her
objectivity, I need to know now.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Cave]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Doctor, there is evidence of residual
bitrious matter in the soil. It was not present before the Entity's
attack. <br>
(she keeps walking away, scanning) <br>
DATA: Doctor? Doctor Marr, you have made it clear that my presence
disturbs you. However, I do not see how we can achieve our task if you
continue to ignore me. <br>
MARR: Commander, I can hear everything you say to me. If there is
anything worth my response, you can be sure I will not be silent. <br>
DATA: Then I do not understand your lack of interest in the bitrious
filament I mentioned. <br>
MARR: It's old news to me. I found evidence of bitrium on the last
three attack sites. It seems to be a residual that the Entity produces
after it absorbs living matter. I'm actually more interested in this
cave. It still amazes me that your group was spared. <br>
DATA: As I have speculated, the presence of refractory metals <br>
MARR: Refractory metals. Yes, I know. On two separate occasions
settlers sought refuge in caves. Some of them deeper than this one.
They perished anyway. <br>
DATA: Were those caves laced with kelbonite or fistrium? <br>
MARR: The tunnels on Forlat Three had strong deposits of kelbonite,
yes. <br>
DATA: Then perhaps the combination of the two metals prevented the
Entity from <br>
MARR: Perhaps it was you. <br>
DATA: I do not understand. <br>
MARR: Maybe it was your presence which made the Entity pass over the
people in this cave. Did that occur to you? <br>
DATA: I cannot see what effect my being here would have had <br>
MARR: If you had been in contact with the Entity, if that's the reason
Melona was attacked, it surely wouldn't have killed its ally. <br>
DATA: Do you believe that I lured the Entity here? <br>
MARR: Did you? <br>
DATA: No, Doctor. Because Lore betrayed the colonists on Omicron Theta,
you believe that I am capable of the same behaviour. You are mistaken,
Doctor. My programming is distinctly different from Lore's. <br>
MARR: You don't understand. I am accusing you of collaborating with
that monster! <br>
DATA: I do understand, and I am attempting to explain to you it is
impossible. <br>
MARR: It's amazing. You can't feel anything, can you? Nothing I say to
you hurts you. <br>
DATA: That is true, Doctor. <br>
MARR: I'm getting a slight elevation on monocaladium particulates in
this cave wall. Are you making note of it? <br>
DATA: Yes, Doctor. <br>
MARR: My son died on Omicron Theta. He was sixteen when the colony was
attacked. That is the reason I have became an expert on the Crystalline
Entity. I have spent my life studying it, tracking it, and hoping
someday to find it. And if I learn you have been helping that thing in
any way whatsoever, I will see to it that you are disassembled piece by
piece.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: Okay, Doctor. We've input all the data you
collected on the surface. <br>
MARR: Just a minute, Commander. I have some cellulose readings from
soil samples that weren't included. <br>
(she inputs them herself) <br>
LAFORGE: You handle that unit like a veteran, Doctor. <br>
MARR: One thing about spending your life gathering information, you
learn your way around computers. Hydrocarbons slightly elevated,
bitrious filaments in trace amounts, lanthanides, nitrates all normal.
Nothing different. Everything falls within the parameters I established
at the other attack sites. <br>
DATA: Were you expecting a different result this time, Doctor? <br>
MARR: I've never surveyed a site so soon after an attack. I thought
maybe I'd find something new. Something that would make a difference. <br>
DATA: Doctor, have you ever scanned your samples for gamma radiation? <br>
MARR: Why would I do that? <br>
DATA: We are seeing high energy reactions that may show up in a gamma
scan. <br>
LAFORGE: And if they do, we might find a pattern, a kind of marker left
behind by the Entity. That's a good idea, Data. <br>
MARR: Frankly, I just don't see what that would get us. <br>
DATA: If the Entity left a residual trace of antiproton in the samples
we collected, a gamma radiation scan would reveal that. <br>
LAFORGE: Getting that readout now, Data. <br>
DATA: If we try a logarithmic scale, we will have better resolution. <br>
LAFORGE: There it is. Do you see it? <br>
DATA: Yes. Doctor? <br>
MARR: A sharp spike at ten keV. Another. A pattern. <br>
LAFORGE: So we know the Entity leaves antiprotons behind. <br>
MARR: If it also deposits antiprotons in space as it travels, can we
detect them? <br>
LAFORGE: Sure. We can set the ship's lateral sensors for gamma
radiation. <br>
MARR: Well, let's get to it, shall we?

DATA: The thanks actually go to Doctor Clendenning on Omicron Theta who
did the first experiments with gamma scans. <br>
MARR: I've never read that. It wasn't in any of his records. <br>
DATA: That is correct. But I possess much of his knowledge. He was
working on new detectors at the time of the attack on Omicron Theta.

Cluster and the Argos system. <br>
PICARD: Is either populated? <br>

PICARD: Ensign, set a course for the Brechtian Cluster. <br>
MARR: Captain, I've done some preliminary estimates on the firing
pattern we need in order to destroy the Entity. The photon torpedoes
will require some reprogramming, but with your permission, I'll give
the calculations to Lieutenant Worf. <br>
PICARD: Reprogram the torpedoes, Mister Worf. Let's hope we don't have
to use them. <br>

Entity, if not to destroy it? <br>
PICARD: We're not hunters, Doctor. Nor is it our role to exact revenge.
<br>
MARR: What do you propose? We track it down, greet it warmly and ask if
it would mind terribly not ravaging any more planets? <br>
PICARD: I don't denying that it may be necessary to fire on it. But I
look on that as a last resort. <br>
MARR: Why? Why not just kill it? <br>
PICARD: I want to try to communicate with it. <br>
MARR: What? <br>
PICARD: We know from our own experience that our shields will protect
us. So long as we're in no danger, I will make every effort to
communicate. <br>
MARR: To what end? <br>
PICARD: If we can determine what its needs are, we might find other
sources to supply it. <br>
MARR: Its needs are to slaughter people by the thousands. It is nothing
but a giant killing machine. <br>
PICARD: Doctor, the sperm whale on Earth devours millions of cuttlefish
as it roams the oceans. It is not evil. It is feeding. The same may be
true of the Crystalline Entity. <br>
MARR: That would be small comfort for those who have died to feed it.
We're not talking about cuttlefish, we're talking about people. <br>
PICARD: I would argue that the Crystalline Entity has as much right to
be here as we do. Now, Commander Data has some theories on how we might
communicate. Please confer with him.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: It was pretty much as we expected, sir. No
survivors. <br>
CRUSHER: Not a trace of anything that was ever alive. Not even a seed
in their greenery storage. <br>
DATA: Warp and impulse engines are down, sir, but they can be
restarted. A skeleton crew could take the ship to a starbase. <br>
PICARD: No, we don't have time for that now. Mister Worf, send a
message to the nearest starbase. Ask them to dispatch a crew. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Mister La Forge, make certain that we're still picking up the
gamma radiation pattern of the Entity. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Have you and Commander Data made any progress in finding a
means of communication? <br>
MARR: I believe so. There are some details to iron out. <br>
PICARD: Please keep working at it. We may need it soon.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Deck seventeen. Doctor, you have seemed
preoccupied since we surveyed the Kallisko. <br>
MARR: I've found it easy to talk to you, Commander. Do you mind if I
tell you something? <br>
DATA: Not at all. <br>
MARR: After hearing the screams of those men, I found it hard not to
think about my son, about what happened to him. I've read stories about
soldiers in the battlefield, wounded, dying. They call for their
mothers. And I've often wondered if my son called for me. If he died
wondering why I didn't come to him. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Come. <br>
(takes his foot off the desk as Riker enters) <br>
RIKER: It's still headed for the Brechtian Cluster. We've
re-established our course. <br>
PICARD: Very well. Oh, one thing, Number One. Starfleet will be
notifying Carmen Davila's family of her death and returning her
personal effects. Would you care to enclose a letter? <br>
RIKER: Yes, sir. I'd like that very much. <br>
PICARD: Is there something more, Number One? <br>
RIKER: Permission to speak freely, sir? <br>
PICARD: Of course. <br>
RIKER: I've been thinking maybe Doctor Marr is right. Maybe we should
destroy the Entity. <br>
PICARD: Why do you think that? <br>
RIKER: It's already killed thousands. It will undoubtedly continue to
kill unless we stop it. I don't want those deaths on my conscience. <br>
PICARD: Are you sure that that's it, Number One, or are you being
influenced by personal feelings? <br>
RIKER: With all due respect, sir, I'm not a raw cadet. I've lost people
on missions before. If we take time to try to communicate with this
thing, we may lose our chance to destroy it. And I don't think we can
risk that. I think I'll go write that letter to Carmen's family.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Data's quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: We should programme the bridge science
station to vary the emissions we direct toward the Entity. <br>
MARR: I'll write a subroutine that will allow us to change the
frequency of the graviton beam. Data? You told me you carried some of
my son's memories. <br>
DATA: That is correct, Doctor. <br>
MARR: What can you tell me about Renny? What were those thoughts? Was
he was he happy at all, on Omicron Theta? <br>
DATA: I have some vivid memories of sporting events. He played parrises
squares with a group of his schoolmates. <br>
MARR: Renny started parrises squares when he was young. Too young,
really. But the older children kept asking him to play, and I couldn't
keep him away. He had this natural gift. <br>
DATA: Yes, he was pleased to have won a championship emblem. <br>
MARR: I remember he wrote me about that. He was so proud. I'm
characterising pulse widths in nanoseconds. Sound right to you? <br>
DATA: Yes, Doctor. Your son's most intense memories revolve around a
young woman named Jenina. <br>
MARR: A girlfriend? I never knew about that. Of course, the last person
he would tell would be his mother. What was she like? <br>
DATA: He enjoyed her kindness, her gentleness, her physical attributes.
<br>
MARR: There. Now we can vary all the parameters directly from the
Bridge. <br>
DATA: Yes, Doctor. <br>
MARR: Could you do something for me? It would mean a lot. <br>
DATA: I would be happy to be of help. <br>
MARR: You see, all I have left of Renny, the only connection of him is
there, inside you. I was wondering if you would talk to me in his
voice. I know you have the ability to sound like other people, isn't
that right? <br>
DATA: That is true, Doctor, but what would you want me to say? <br>
MARR: Maybe something from his journals. <br>
DATA: Many of his journal entries took the form of letters to friends
and family. I could access one of those. <br>
DATA: (as Renny): I took my last exam today I think I did all right on
everything except cellular biology. I know you think it's important,
Mom, but I don't see how I'm ever going to use this stuff. In a couple
of weeks, a bunch of us are going on an archaeological dig in the
mountains. The Wallaces said it would be all right as long as we had
adult supervision, so don't worry. They're looking out for me. They're
really great people and I like them a lot, but they're kind of serious.
They don't have your sense of humour, Mom. Mom, I miss you.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 45129.2. We are still in
pursuit of the Crystalline Entity. Data and Doctor Marr are prepared to
attempt communication with the being when we intercept it. I will admit
to some uncertainty about the prospect. It could
prove to be a scientific triumph, or a catastrophe.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: Sir, the Brechtian Cluster is now five light
years away. <br>
RIKER: Are we still picking up the Entity's pattern? <br>
DATA: Yes, Commander, but sensors have not yet locked onto its exact
whereabouts. <br>
MARR: Captain, we are reasonably sure it's between here and the
Brechtian Cluster. If I start emitting the graviton beam now, it may
serve as a lure. A kind of beacon. <br>
PICARD: Make it so. <br>
MARR: We'll start with a pulse width of five nanoseconds, frequency one
pulse per second. <br>
DATA: Commencing graviton emissions now. <br>
(and out goes the sonar beep) <br>
LAFORGE: No change in the sensor readings. <br>
MARR: Let's ramp frequency. <br>
DATA: Emissions now at ten pulses per second. <br>
WORF: Sir. <br>
MARR: What is it? Do you have something? <br>
WORF: A large mass approaching at warp speed. <br>
PICARD: Full stop. <br>
HELM: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Doctor, continue emitting the signals. Mister Worf, on screen. <br>
RIKER: Shields up. <br>
PICARD: Magnify. <br>
MARR: It's beautiful. <br>
RIKER: What's it doing? Checking us out? <br>
PICARD: Possibly. Just as we're checking it out. <br>
DATA: Doctor Marr, do you wish to change the frequency? Doctor Marr? <br>
MARR: Yes. Yes, proceed, Commander. <br>
DATA: Changing to twenty pulses per second. <br>
(the Entity changes its direction of rotation) <br>
TROI: Is it responding to us? <br>
MARR: Let's test that. Ramp the frequency again, Commander. <br>
DATA: Emissions now at thirty pulses per second. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, I'm reading a transmission from the Entity. A series
of graviton pulses. <br>
MARR: It's working. That's a response to our signal. <br>
PICARD: Remarkable. <br>
DATA: Captain, there is a pattern emerging from the signals. <br>
PICARD: It's trying to communicate with us. <br>
DATA: I believe so, sir, but it will take some time to decipher the
patterns. <br>
PICARD: Then it's possible. Communication, understanding. <br>
MARR: Let me try something else. A continuous graviton beam. <br>
LAFORGE: All graviton pulses from the Entity have stopped. <br>
TROI: Maybe it doesn't like what we're doing. <br>
PICARD: Doctor, return to the intermittent signal. <br>
(the Entity begins to shake) <br>
DATA: Doctor? Doctor Marr? Doctor Marr, we must return to the
intermittent signal. <br>
PICARD: Counsellor? <br>
TROI: Something's very wrong, Captain. <br>
DATA: Sir, the Entity is beginning to resonate. Vibrations are
increasing. <br>
PICARD: Doctor, stop the transmission. That is an order. Doctor Marr,
do you hear me? <br>
MARR: It's for you, Renny I did it for you. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, take charge of the Doctor. Mister Data, shut down
the transmission. <br>
LAFORGE: Vibration amplitude is increasing. It can't last much longer. <br>
DATA: I cannot stop our graviton signal, Captain. Doctor Marr has
isolated the access code. <br>
LAFORGE: Maybe I can create an override sequence. Shut it down from
here. <br>
DATA: The amplitude is still rising, Captain. Resonance is approaching
critical. <br>
LAFORGE: I can override her programme, but it's going to take some
time. <br>
(and the Entity shatters into a billion tiny shards) <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, will you escort the Doctor to her quarters. <br>
WORF: Yes, sir. <br>
MARR: It will never hurt anyone again. <br>
DATA: Perhaps I should escort the Doctor, sir. <br>
PICARD: Fine, but don't leave her unattended. <br>
DATA: Please come with me, Doctor. <br>
MARR: Of course.

MARR: How long will you live, Data? <br>
DATA: There has been no predetermined limit placed on my existence,
Doctor. <br>
MARR: I'm glad. As long as you're alive he'll be alive. I need your
help, Data. <br>
DATA: In what way, Doctor? <br>
MARR: Like you did before. Tell me that you understand, Renny. That you
know I did it for you, because I love you. Because I wanted to give you
peace at last. <br>
DATA: I do not find such a file in your son's journals. However, from
what I know of him by his memories and his writing, I do not believe he
would be happy. He was proud of your career as a scientist, and now you
have destroyed that. You say you did it for him, but I do not believe
he would have wanted that. Yes, I believe your son would be very sad
now. I am sorry, Doctor, but I cannot help you. </font> </p>
