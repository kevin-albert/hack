PICARD: How did he seem then? <br>
RIKER: Fine. I complimented him on getting the refit done faster than
expected. He was pleased that I'd noticed. <br>
TROI: I met with him about six weeks ago, during the crew evaluations.
He was very positive. He was looking forward to being posted to the

PICARD [OC]: Acknowledged. <br>
DATA: Geordi, would you agree that the instinct for self-preservation
is shared by most life forms? <br>
LAFORGE: I'd say it's probably the most basic instinct, Data. <br>
DATA: That being the case, I find it difficult to understand why
someone would deliberately terminate their own existence. <br>
LAFORGE: I don't know, Data. All I can think is that maybe Lieutenant
Kwan felt that there was something wrong in his life, something he felt
powerless to fix. <br>
DATA: I believe I understand. I have been in a similar situation. <br>
LAFORGE: Really? <br>
DATA: The first months following my activation were a difficult period
for me. There were many problems associated with my becoming sentient. <br>
LAFORGE: Because your neural net was still forming. <br>
DATA: As I acquired new skills, neural pathways would form replacing
other less complex pathways. It was very disorienting. <br>
LAFORGE: I bet. <br>
DATA: As my systems grew in complexity, it became increasingly
difficult to integrate new pathways into my existing neural net. The
probability of cascade failure grew with each additional pathway. I
came to the conclusion it would be safer and easier to shut myself down
and start again. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, but if you had done that, you wouldn't have remembered
any of the things that had happened to you. <br>
DATA: In a way, it would have been like committing suicide. <br>
LAFORGE: So what did you do? <br>
DATA: I decided against the procedure. I chose instead to treat the
problems I was having with my systems as challenges to overcome, rather
than obstacles to be avoided. <br>
LAFORGE: Great way of looking at it, Data. I wish Lieutenant Kwan had
been able to look at his problems the same way.

TROI: His mother's Napean, his father's human. It all looks so normal.
For some reason I half expected the place to be a mess. <br>
WORF: Yes. It is strange to think that someone could have considered
ending his life and yet give no outward sign. Just before he jumped, he
seemed almost calm. <br>
TROI: Well, he must have been in a lot of pain to do what he did. It
could be that the prospect of ending the pain felt like a great relief.

WORF: Yes, she is a medical technician in Sickbay. <br>
TROI: It's always hard to lose someone you care about, but to lose them

morning. <br>

the nacelle tube refit last night. After pulling two double shifts in a
row, I'm really looking forward to spending some time with Maddy. <br>

thinking he's going to show up and tell me there's been some kind of
terrible misunderstanding. <br>
TROI: I thought you might like to know that in his personal logs, Dan
talked about you a great deal. He loved you very much. <br>
CALLOWAY: If that's true, then how could he leave me like this? <br>
TROI: That's what I'm trying to find out. I know it's hard to talk
right now, but it would be very helpful if you could tell me a few
things about him. When was the last time you saw him? <br>
CALLOWAY: Two nights ago. We were planning our next shore leave
together. <br>
TROI: Did he mention anything that had happened recently, anything that
might have upset him? <br>
CALLOWAY: No, not really. He did say something about work, about
Lieutenant Nara, but it wasn't anything serious. <br>
TROI: Nara. She's his superior officer in the nacelle tube? <br>
CALLOWAY: Yes. Dan sensed that she, well, that she felt threatened by
him. That she thought he was after her position. <br>
TROI: Was he prone to mood swings or depression? <br>
CALLOWAY: No, but he was very sensitive to other people's moods. He
used to look at me and know exactly what I was feeling. I always loved
that about him. <br>
TROI: Well, Napeans are partially empathic. He may have inherited some
of his mother's abilities. <br>
CALLOWAY: He used to tease me that when I met her, I wouldn't be able
to get away with anything. Dan and I knew each other for over two
years, but we didn't get together until a few months ago. We took it
slow. We thought we had all the time in the world. Something must have
happened to him, Counsellor. Something terrible, because it's not like
Dan to take his own life. <br>
TROI: I understand. <br>
CALLOWAY: Please, find out what it was.

TROI: I'm investigating Lieutenant Kwan's death, and I just wanted to
look around. <br>
NARA: It's such a shame. He was a good man. <br>
TROI: Did you notice any change in his behaviour recently? <br>
NARA: No. I've been going over the last few days in my mind, trying to
see if I, if I missed any warning signs. It's as if something in him
just snapped. <br>
TROI: How was his job performance? <br>
NARA: Excellent. He knew this ship better than most people, probably
because he helped build it back at Utopia Planitia. <br>
TROI: Did he get along with his coworkers? <br>
NARA: He was ambitious. He came in here with all sorts of new ideas
about how to do things. Some of them very good ideas. <br>

suddenly overwhelmed by a flood of emotions. Fear, rage, panic. And the
sensations didn't seem to be coming from any person. They were just
there, in the room. <br>
RIKER: Whose emotions were they? I thought you said were alone. <br>

WORF: I scanned the area. I found no anomalous readings. <br>
RIKER: How could you get an empathic impression from an empty room? <br>
TROI: I don't know. <br>
CRUSHER: Could the fact that Lieutenant Kwan was partially empathic
have anything to do with it? <br>
RIKER: What do you mean? <br>
CRUSHER: I'm not sure, but certainly the feelings Troi described are
consistent with suicide. <br>
RIKER: Could his death have left some sort of empathic echo? <br>
TROI: I don't see how. But if I went back to the nacelle tube, I might
get a better sense of what I experienced. <br>
CRUSHER: I don't think I'd recommend that right now. You're showing
elevated levels of psilosynine. <br>
WORF: Psilosynine? <br>
CRUSHER: It's a neurotransmitter involved in telepathy. The experience
overwhelmed you the first time. I think you should wait until your
levels return to normal. <br>
RIKER: How long? <br>
CRUSHER: Three, maybe four hours. <br>

optimistic. It just doesn't make any sense. Can I get you anything? <br>
WORF: No. No, nothing. <br>
TROI: Yridian tea. I've been thinking about what happened to me in the
nacelle tube. Whether it was an empathic echo left by Kwan's death. <br>
WORF: In the past, have your empathic experiences always involved the
physical presence of another person? <br>
TROI: All the ones I'm sure of, yes. <br>
WORF: What do you mean, sure of? <br>
TROI: Well, when I was a young girl, my grandfather used to tell me
stories by the fire. I would close my eyes and listen to his mind for
hours on end. <br>
WORF: He would tell you these stories telepathically? <br>
TROI: My grandfather rarely spoke. He said that was for off-worlders
and people who didn't know any better. Now the only time I can remember
his stories is when I go home and sit by the fireplace. Sometimes when
I'm alone there, it's almost as if I can hear his voice inside my head.
<br>
WORF: Yes. Yes, I too have sought visions in fire. <br>
TROI: I can't explain it, but it feels real to me. Just like what
happened in the nacelle tube. <br>
WORF: There are things we do not understand, yet they exist
nonetheless. Perhaps I should let you get some rest. <br>

TROI: Yes, I think I do. There was a tool crate on the floor. It was
labeled Utopia Planitia. <br>
DATA: The shipyard where the Enterprise was built. <br>
PICARD: Clearly this was much more than an empathic echo. It seems that
you were actually seeing something that happened in the control room
eight years ago. <br>
TROI: Everyone was looking directly at me, but it was as though I was
seeing through someone else's eyes. <br>
DATA: Lieutenant Kwan was partially empathic. <br>
CRUSHER: Maybe you were seeing it through his eyes? <br>
TROI: It's possible, but I don't see how it could have happened. <br>
PICARD: Well, putting that on one side for the moment, let's assume
that by some unexplained phenomenon, you witnessed an event that
occurred to Lieutenant Kwan. Those faces that you saw. Did you
recognise any of them? <br>
TROI: I've never seen the woman before, or the man who was with her.
But there was someone else there. A man. He was staring at me in the
most peculiar way. I think he had reddish hair. And he did seem
familiar to me. But it's all so hazy. It's like trying to remember a
dream. <br>
PICARD: There was a woman who was frightened. And then you saw her
again, laughing, presumably at Lieutenant Kwan. <br>
CRUSHER: What does it all mean? <br>
TROI: I don't know, but something terrible happened in there. I felt
it. <br>
PICARD: Counsellor, I want you to look through the personnel files of
Utopia Planitia. See if you can recognise any of those faces. <br>
TROI: If only I could go back to the control room without being
overwhelmed by the experience. It might help me remember some detail
that might be relevant. <br>
CRUSHER: I could give you an inhibitor that would slow the brain's
production of psilosynine. That might be able to suppress your empathic
abilities and make the experience more manageable. It would take about
sixteen hours to synthesise the inhibitor. <br>

transporting to Barson Two require special security measures to insure
they are properly contained. Have you found anything? <br>
TROI: No. There were literally thousands of people involved in building
the Enterprise. <br>
WORF: Perhaps if you should try to narrow the search parameters. <br>
TROI: I think I have. The man who looked familiar to me may have served
on board the Enterprise in the last seven years, so I've asked the
computer to limit its search to personnel who served at Utopia Planitia
and on the Enterprise. <br>
TROI: Ensign Salvatore. He transferred over a year ago. Lieutenant
Ziff. She's in Quantum mechanics. That's him. <br>

pretty smoothly. What's this all about, if you don't mind my asking? <br>

(next morning, Troi is still in bed and Worf is already dressed. He
kisses her awake. I thought non-Klingon females were too fragile??) <br>
TROI: Hello. <br>
WORF: Breakfast is ready. <br>
TROI: That sounds nice. But it can wait. Why didn't we do this a long
time ago? <br>

CRUSHER: This should take effect immediately. <br>
TROI: Will it completely suppress my empathic abilities? <br>
CRUSHER: It's hard to say for sure, but I can always increase the
dosage if it's not enough. <br>
(Worf enters with Calloway) <br>
WORF: The cargo bay will be off limits to all but medical personnel. <br>
CALLOWAY: Thanks for your help, sir. <br>
WORF: You're welcome. <br>
TROI: Good morning. <br>
WORF: Counsellor. <br>
TROI: Data and Geordi are already in the nacelle tube. Are you ready? <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
CALLOWAY: Excuse me, sir. About the quarantine field in the cargo bay?
It looks like we'll need a second field generator. <br>
WORF: I am needed here. I will join you as soon as I can. <br>
TROI: All right. <br>
WORF: Apparently my help was not so good after all. <br>
CALLOWAY: Yes, it was. You were wonderful. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: Counsellor, you okay? <br>
TROI: I'm fine. The inhibitor seems to be working. Have you found
anything? <br>
LAFORGE: No, nothing unusual. <br>
TROI: I don't remember seeing these during my empathic experience. Have
they been here since the ship was built? <br>
DATA: No, they were installed two years ago. <br>
(Troi goes up the ladder to the nacelle proper) <br>
TROI: Geordi, I remember seeing a plasma conduit right there. <br>
LAFORGE: The main ODN line runs right behind that panel. It lifts out
so you can get to it. <br>
NARA: Kwan was working on that conduit the day before he died. <br>
TROI: Can you open it? <br>
LAFORGE: Sure. It'll take just a minute. <br>
(he goes downstairs.) <br>
LAFORGE: Data. <br>
TROI: Lieutenant Nara, may I ask you something? The work Lieutenant
Kwan was doing, was it unusual in any way? <br>
NARA: He was refitting a field coil, but it was probably the first time
that particular panel's been opened since the ship was built. <br>
TROI: Thank you. </font></p>

WOMAN: No! <br>
(Troi sees Pierce in his UP coverall) <br>
LAFORGE: Counsellor, are you all right? <br>
TROI: Something happened when you removed the panel. There's something
in there. <br>
DATA: I am getting readings that indicate organic material embedded in
this wall. <br>
LAFORGE: Organic? You're right. Let me reconfigure the emitter beam. We
might be able to see what it is. There. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: This dosage should prevent any further
empathic flashes. <br>
CALLOWAY: The bone fragments are definitely human. I sequenced a DNA
sample. I'll see if I can match it to Starfleet records. <br>
(Worf goes to stand over Calloway at the console) <br>
CALLOWAY: Accessing Starfleet personnel records. <br>
(Worf and Calloway talk under the dialogue, and Troi keeps looking at
them) <br>
CRUSHER: I'd say these fragments had been in the wall about seven or
eight years. You said something happened when the panel was opened. <br>
TROI: Yes. <br>
CRUSHER: I wonder if the fragments themselves could have somehow
triggered your experience. I'll run a resonance scan, see if anything
turns up. <br>
CALLOWAY: Sir, I think we've found a match. <br>
WORF: Apparently the remains are those of an Ensign Marla Finn. <br>
CALLOWAY: I'm trying to find a picture of her in the records. <br>
TROI: That's her. That's the woman I saw. <br>
CRUSHER: It says she was reported missing from Utopia Planitia on
stardate 40987.2. Eight years ago. But how did her body become embedded
in a bulkhead? <br>
CALLOWAY: Maybe there was some kind of an accident. <br>
WORF: Or she was killed and the murderer hid her remains. <br>
TROI: Something's not right. Pull up Lieutenant Kwan's service record.
I thought so. He didn't arrive at the shipyard until six months after
Finn's death. I couldn't have been seeing through his eyes. <br>
CRUSHER: Then whose? <br>
TROI: Well it had to be someone who was at least partially telepathic. <br>
WORF: Pierce? <br>
CRUSHER: But you saw him there. <br>
TROI: Yes, but not as clearly as I could see everything else. His face
looked like that. <br>
CRUSHER: A reflection. <br>
TROI: So I was seeing through his eyes. And Finn was trying to get away
from him. She was afraid of him. <br>
WORF: I think it is time we had another conversation with Lieutenant
Pierce. Ensign Calloway, thank you for your help.

night? <br>
WORF: No, of course not. <br>
TROI: Are you sure? Because I don't want anything to jeopardise our
friendship. <br>
WORF: Deanna, I do not regret being with you. What is wrong? <br>
TROI: I'm not feeling myself. Maybe it's the inhibitor. I'm so used to
sensing what people are feeling, and now I can't. <br>
WORF: Perhaps I should talk to Lieutenant Pierce alone. <br>
TROI: That might be a good idea. <br>

TROI: It all seemed so real to me. I can't believe that everything I
experienced happened in just those few seconds. <br>
DATA: It appears Counsellor was correct. Pierce was partially
telepathic. His maternal grandmother was born on Betazed. <br>
PICARD: What else have you found out? <br>
DATA: According to Starfleet records, Pierce and the other persons
Counsellor Troi identified, were killed in an accidental plasma
discharge eight years ago. Their bodies were never found. <br>
TROI: I don't believe it was an accident. I think Lieutenant Pierce
found out the other two were having an affair. He lost control and he
killed them both. Afterwards, he probably activated the plasma stream
and then threw himself into it. <br>
WORF: The plasma discharge would have obliterated any evidence that it
was murder. <br>
(La Forge enters) <br>
LAFORGE: I scanned behind the panel Counsellor Troi asked me to. I
didn't find any bone fragments but I did find some traces of cellular
residue showing some kind of psionic signature. <br>
TROI: It may be that when Lieutenant Pierce was struck by the plasma
stream, the subspace energy present there imprinted his empathic
pattern into the residue. <br>
LAFORGE: Kind of like a psychic photograph. <br>
TROI: That's what triggered my hallucination. My mind must have taken
elements from my own life and then created a situation that in many
ways mirrored what happened to Pierce. If you hadn't been there, I
would have jumped just like he did.
