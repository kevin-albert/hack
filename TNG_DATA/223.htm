DATA: Indeterminate. I am attempting to screen out sensor interference.
Readings are still inconclusive, however the moon's atmosphere is
capable of supporting life.<br>

TROI: Captain, I just wondered if there's anything you wanted to talk
about.<br>
PICARD: I don't think so, Counsellor.<br>
TROI: I would have thought having a Borg on the ship would stir some
feelings.<br>
PICARD: I'm quite recovered from my experience, thank you.<br>
TROI: Sometimes even when a victim has dealt with his assault there are
residual effects of the event that linger. You were treated violently
by the Borg. <a href="175.htm" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
Kidnapped, assaulted,
mutilated.</a> <br>
PICARD: Counsellor. Counsellor, I very much appreciate your concern for
me, but I can assure you it is quite misplaced. I have carefully
considered the implications of having a Borg on this
ship. I have weighed the possible risks, and I am convinced that we are
doing the right thing. Now, I am quite comfortable with my decision.<br>
TROI: I see. Well, if at any point you want to talk more.<br>
PICARD: I shall certainly avail myself of your help.

WORF: Lower the forcefield.<br>
(a medic enters the cell and the forcefield is raised again. Picard
enters the Brig) <br>
WORF: Captain, the Borg is still unconscious.<br>
CRUSHER: He suffered massive internal injuries. We've been able to
control the haemorrhaging, but some of the implants in his brain were
damaged. I may have to remove them.<br>
PICARD: The Borg will die if they're removed permanently. Their brains
grow dependent on the biochips.<br>
CRUSHER: Perhaps Geordi can construct some new implants. <br>
LAFORGE: They contain relatively straightforward programming, interface
protocols. We have the files we downloaded after your experience,
Captain. I think I can manage it.<br>
PICARD: Mister La Forge, do you know enough about Borg programming to
alter the pathways to their root command structure?<br>
LAFORGE: I'm not sure, sir. The subroutines are pretty complicated. I'd
probably have to study the data processing algorithms. It's the only
way I could trace the access codes.<br>
PICARD: If we could get to the root command, we could introduce an
invasive programming sequence through its biochip system and then
return it to the hive. <br>
LAFORGE: The Borg are so interconnected it would act like a virus.<br>
PICARD: Which would infect the entire Collective. We could disable
their neural network at a stroke.<br>
CRUSHER: Infect it? You make it sound like a disease.<br>
PICARD: Quite right, Doctor. If all goes well, a terminal one.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: If this works the way I think it will,
once the invasive programme starts spreading, it'll only be a matter of
months before the Borg suffer total systems failure.<br>
PICARD: Comments.<br>
CRUSHER: A question. What exactly is total systems failure?<br>
DATA: The Borg are extremely computer dependent. A systems failure will
destroy them.<br>
CRUSHER: I just think we should be plain about that. We're talking
about annihilating an entire race.<br>
PICARD: Which under most circumstances would be unconscionable. But as
I see it, the Borg leave us with little choice.<br>
RIKER: I agree. We're at war.<br>
CRUSHER: There's been no formal declaration of war.<br>
TROI: Not from us, but certainly from them. They've attacked us in
every encounter.<br>
PICARD: They've declared war on our way of life. We are to be
assimilated.<br>
CRUSHER: But even in war there are rules. You don't kill civilians
indiscriminately.<br>
RIKER: There are no civilians among the Borg.<br>
PICARD: Think of them as a single, collective being. There's no one
Borg who is more an individual than your arm or your leg.<br>
CRUSHER: How convenient.<br>
PICARD: Your point, Doctor?<br>
CRUSHER: When I look at my patient, I don't see a collective
consciousness. I don't see a hive. I see a living, breathing boy who's
been hurt and who needs our help. And we're talking about sending him
back to his people as an instrument of destruction.<br>
PICARD: It comes down to this. We're faced with an enemy who are
determined to destroy us, and we have no hope of negotiating a peace.
Unless that changes, we are justified in doing anything we can to
survive.<br>

CRUSHER: What's he doing?<br>
PICARD: He's trying to find an access terminal so he can interface with
the collective. He doesn't understand that the signal has been cut off.<br>
LAFORGE: He's emitting a homing signal and a second subspace beacon,
but our damping field is blocking both signals.<br>
PICARD: He's alone. For the first time he's being forced to cope with
his environment without the resources of the Collective.<br>
CRUSHER: He must be hungry. The Borg don't ingest food. Their implants
can synthesise any organic molecules the biological tissues require.
What they need is energy.<br>
PICARD: Arrange to feed it.<br>

PICARD: Centuries ago, when laboratory animals were used for
experiments, scientists would sometimes become attached to the
creatures. This would a problem if the experiment involved killing
them. I would suggest that you unattach yourself from the Borg, Mister
La Forge.<br>
LAFORGE: Aye, Captain.

PICARD: Guinan. Please, come in.<br>
GUINAN: Are you sure? You look like you're preparing for a quiet
evening.<br>
PICARD: No, I'm delighted to see you. Can I get you something to drink?<br>
GUINAN: No, thank you. I was thinking about how you said the other day
that my foil was dipping. That I should get some exercise and
strengthen my arm.<br>
PICARD: Well. a strong forearm is certainly an advantage in fencing.<br>
GUINAN: And bartending. About the Borg. Aren't you the least bit
surprised by him?<br>
PICARD: Surprised?<br>
GUINAN: Did you know he has a name? La Forge gave it to him. His name's
Hugh. And he's lonely. I don't know what made me go see him. La Forge
said I should, but I said no. And suddenly there I was standing there,
staring at him. I thought it was just curiosity. Just curious. I need
to hear you say that you are sure you're doing the right thing.<br>
PICARD: If you're here to persuade me not to use the invasive programme.<br>
GUINAN: No. I think I need you to persuade me.<br>
PICARD: Two days ago, you were so upset about the Borg even being on
the ship that you tore my foil out of my hand. And now you're here
questioning whether it should be treated as the enemy.<br>
GUINAN: No. But when you talk to him face to face, can you honestly say
you don't have any doubt?<br>
PICARD: I haven't talked to it.<br>
GUINAN: Why not?<br>
PICARD: I saw no need.<br>
GUINAN: If you're going to use this person <br>
PICARD: It's not a person, damn it, it's a Borg!<br>
GUINAN: If you are going to use this person to destroy his race, you
should at least look him in the eye once before you do it. Because I am
not sure he is still a Borg.<br>
PICARD: Because it's been given a name by a member of my crew doesn't
mean it's not a Borg. Because it's young doesn't mean that it's
innocent. It is what it is, and in spite of efforts to turn it into
some kind of pet I will not alter my plans.<br>
GUINAN: Fine. But if you don't talk to him at least once, you may find
that decision a harder to live with than you realise.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: I think I deliberately avoided speaking
with the Borg because I didn't want anything to get in the way of our
plan.
But now that I have, he seems to be a fully realised individual. He has
even accepted me as Picard, Captain of this ship, and not as Locutus.<br>
LAFORGE: So you've reconsidered the plan?<br>
PICARD: Yes. To use him in this manner, we'd be no better than the
enemy that we seek to destroy. So, I want other options.<br>
RIKER: We could return him to the crash site. We'd have to remove his
memory of being on the Enterprise.<br>
CRUSHER: But if we erase his memory, who he is or who he has become
would be destroyed.<br>
RIKER: Isn't that the point? He'd be reassimilated into the hive
without any questions.<br>
LAFORGE: Does that seems right, to help him become an individual and
then take that away from him? <br>
CRUSHER: Is there any danger that the Borg might destroy him if they
find out what's happened?<br>
PICARD: I doubt it. There'd be nothing to gain. It's more likely that
they would simply wipe out his memory of those experiences.<br>
RIKER: Then either way, his memory would have been erased.<br>
PICARD: But perhaps in that short time before they purge his memory,
the sense of individuality which he has gained here might be
transmitted throughout the entire Borg Collective. Every one of the
Borg being given the opportunity to experience the feeling of
singularity. Perhaps that's the most pernicious programme of all. The
knowledge of self being spread throughout the Collective, in that brief
moment, might alter them forever. We leave his memory intact.<br>
CRUSHER: I have a question. What if he doesn't want to go back?

will come for me.<br>
