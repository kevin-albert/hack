They're as far away from mine as possible, so you don't even have to
see me if you don't want to. <br>
WESLEY: Mom, you know that's not why I asked for my own quarters this
time. <br>
CRUSHER: You don't have to explain. There comes a time in a young man's
life when he doesn't want to stay with his poor senile mother. I
understand. <br>
WESLEY: I'll come visit you in the old Doctor's Home every Sunday. <br>

WESLEY: Come in. <br>
LAFORGE: So, is there a runaway cadet in here? <br>
DATA: If so, we may have to call Security. <br>
LAFORGE: Welcome back, Wes. <br>
WESLEY: Thanks. <br>
LAFORGE: So, how's life at the Academy? <br>
WESLEY: (sigh) It's great. It's great but it's good to have a break. <br>
DATA: I was of course not serious about calling Security. It was a
joke. <br>
WESLEY: I got it, Data. <br>
LAFORGE: So, are you just going to lounge while we all have work to do
around here? <br>
WESLEY: I'm sure I can find some time to help you, sir. <br>
LAFORGE: Wes, enjoy your vacation. I'm sure you've earned it. <br>
WESLEY: Thanks. <br>
CRUSHER: Well, I think we'd better let you settle in. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, that's a good idea. Say, Wes, don't sleep your whole
vacation away, all right? <br>

RIKER: Admiral Necheyev has just beamed aboard. She's being escorted
right here. <br>
PICARD: Good. <br>
RIKER: Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches and Bularian canapes. Are
you up for a promotion? <br>
PICARD: I am trying to establish a new relationship with the Admiral.
There has been a certain amount of tension between us in the past. <br>
RIKER: Tension is hardly the word I'd use. <br>
PICARD: Well, I am trying to get things off on a better note this time.
I want to make her feel at ease. I want her to feel that she's welcome
aboard the Enterprise. <br>
RIKER: Is there any reason she shouldn't feel welcome here? <br>
PICARD: We don't have to like her, Will, but we have to follow her
orders, and maintaining this atmosphere of confrontation serves no
purpose. <br>
(a security officer and the tiny woman enter) <br>
PICARD: Admiral Necheyev, welcome aboard the Enterprise. <br>
NECHEYEV: Thank you. You may leave, Commander Riker. <br>
RIKER: Thank you, Admiral. Captain. <br>
(Riker and Security leave) <br>
PICARD: May I offer you some refreshment? <br>
NECHEYEV: I'll come right to the point, Captain. There is a situation
that's developed on the Cardassian border that. (double-take) Are those
Bularian
canapes? <br>
PICARD: As a matter of fact, they are. I spoke with your aide,
Commander Wrightwell, and he said that you were particularly fond of
them. <br>
NECHEYEV: That was very thoughtful, Captain. Thank you. <br>
PICARD: Please. You were saying about the Cardassians? <br>
(Picard pours the tea) <br>
NECHEYEV: Yes. The Federation has just completed a very long and
drawn-out series of negotiations regarding the final status of our
border with the Cardassians. These will be the official boundaries. <br>
(she hands over a PADD) <br>
PICARD: I see. <br>
NECHEYEV: You'll notice a demilitarised zone has also been created
along the border. Neither side will be permitted to place military
outposts, conduct fleet exercises, or station warships anywhere in the
demilitarised area. <br>
PICARD: This border places several Federation colonies in Cardassian
territory and some Cardassian colonies in ours. <br>
NECHEYEV: This agreement is far from perfect. Neither side got
everything they wanted, but every side got something. And as someone
once said, diplomacy is the art of the possible. Those colonies finding
themselves on the wrong side of the border will have to be moved. <br>
PICARD: Well, the colonists are not going to be happy about that. Some
of them have been there for decades. <br>
NECHEYEV: It won't be easy, but it's a reasonable price to pay for
peace. Your mission will be to evacuate the colony on Dorvan Five. <br>
PICARD: Dorvan Five? Isn't that where the group of North American
Indians settled? <br>
NECHEYEV: Yes. They've been there for about twenty years. They've
established a village in a small valley on the southern continent. Is
something wrong? <br>
PICARD: Admiral, centuries ago these North American Indians were
forcibly displaced from their ancestral lands. These settlers on Dorvan
Five originally left Earth more than two hundred years ago in order to
preserve their cultural identities. <br>
NECHEYEV: I am aware of that, Captain. <br>
PICARD: You see, Admiral, there are some very disturbing historical
parallels here. Once more, they're being asked to leave their homes
because of a political decision that has been taken by a distant
government. <br>
NECHEYEV: An Indian representative was included in the deliberations of
the Federation Council. His objections were noted, discussed, but
ultimately rejected. Captain, the Indians on Dorvan are a nomadic group
that have settled there only twenty years ago, and at that time they
were warned that the planet was hotly disputed by the Cardassians. The
bottom line is they never should have gone there in the first place. <br>
PICARD: Granted, but to go to them now after twenty years later and ask
them to leave what is now their home. <br>
NECHEYEV: I made that same argument with the Federation Council. But it
took three years to negotiate this treaty.
Some concessions had to be made, and this is one of them. <br>
PICARD: What if these Indians refuse to be evacuated? <br>
NECHEYEV: Then your orders will be to remove them by whatever means are
necessary. I understand your moral objections, Captain. If you wish, I
can find someone else to command the Enterprise for this mission. <br>
PICARD: That will not be necessary, Admiral. <br>
NECHEYEV: I don't envy you this task, but I do believe it is for the
greater good. <br>
PICARD: I understand. <br>
NECHEYEV: And Captain, thank you for making me feel welcome. <br>
PICARD: You will always be welcome aboard this ship, Admiral.

LAFORGE: Thanks, Ensign. Hey, Wes! There you are. Come here for a
second. I've got something I want to show you. Come on, come on. You've
got to take a look at this. Now, remember how we always used to talk
about improving quantum efficiency by creating a new plasmadyne relay?
Well, take a look at this. <br>
WESLEY: You've only got one microfusion interrelay in there? Your
converter interface'll never hold up. <br>
LAFORGE: Hey, I ran these diagnostics myself. This little baby will
withstand over five hundred Cochranes of warp field stress. <br>
WESLEY: I don't think so. You better put a secondary phase inverter in
there. Look at your subprocessor matrix. It needs an overhaul. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, that may be your opinion, Cadet, but I stand by my work.
<br>
WESLEY: Read the latest paper from Doctor Vassbinder. He has brilliant
new theories on warp propulsion inter-relays. He's say all this stuff
is obsolete. <br>
LAFORGE: I don't know what's gotten into you, Wes. <br>
WESLEY: Look, do you want my help or not? <br>

dismissed. </font></p>

around the table) <br>
PICARD: Anthwara, there's very little I can do. The decision about this
planet was made at the very highest level of Starfleet. <br>
WAKASA: (a young man) Do you know how long we have searched for a home?
Almost two hundred years. Then we found this world. Can you blame us
for not wanting to give it up? <br>
PICARD: I understand and I respect your people's long journey, but I
believe that I can help you to find a new home. <br>
TROI: As you can see, there are three other planets in this sector that
have environmental conditions similar to those here on Dorvan Five.
They're all uninhabited and could be colonised immediately. <br>
PICARD: And if none of these worlds meet with your approval, then we'll
find you other choices. <br>
ANTHWARA: (a lovely mane of white hair) You do not understand, Captain.
The choice of this world was not only because of environmental
conditions. There were other more intangible concerns as well. When I
came here twenty years ago, I was welcomed by the mountains, the
rivers, the sky.&nbsp;<br>
WAKASA: Anthwara, he's laughing at you. He thinks you're talking about
old superstition and nonsense. <br>
PICARD: This is not true. I have the deepest deal of respect for your
beliefs and the meaning that they hold for your people. <br>
ANTHWARA: Then you can respect the fact that this planet holds a deep
spiritual significance for us. It has taken us two centuries to find
this place. We do not want to spend another two hundred years searching
for what we already have. <br>
TROI: Captain, I suggest we adjourn. Allow us all time to think about
what's been said. <br>
ANTHWARA: Agreed. We will reconvene tomorrow. <br>
PICARD: And in the meantime, I would like to invite you all to join us
this evening on the Enterprise. <br>

been moody, sullen and rude. What's going on? <br>

CRUSHER: That incident in Engineering was inexcusable. <br>
WESLEY: That is my business. I don't need you telling me how to behave.
<br>
CRUSHER: I shouldn't have to. You're a fourth year Starfleet cadet. You
should have a certain level of maturity. <br>

sick of living up to everyone else's expectations. Did you ever think

history and traditions of your people, and I was very interested to
learn that your grandfather, Katowa, was the man who first led the
group of Indians from Earth initially more than two hundred years ago. <br>
ANTHWARA: There was great deal of opposition. Even my own father was
against it. But when Katowa made his decision, it was final. My father
never said another word. <br>
PICARD: It's never easy to leave one's home, the safe and the familiar.
But there are times when the greater good demands that certain
sacrifices are made. I'm sure that was something that your grandfather
understood. <br>
ANTHWARA: So does his grandson. There are also times when a people
sacrificed too much. When a people must hold on to what we have, even
against overwhelming opposition. What do you know about your family,
Captain? <br>
PICARD: Well, a great deal actually. My father was a strong believer in
passing on the traditions and history of the family. <br>
ANTHWARA: I would like to know more about your family. We have very
strong ties to our ancestors. We believe their actions guide us even
now. Knowing more about your family might help me to better understand
you. Besides, it is always good to understand one's adversary in any
negotiation. <br>
PICARD: I hope that by the end of this matter, you will no longer look
at me as an adversary. My family. Well, our roots in Western Europe go
back to the time of Charlemagne. <br>

WESLEY: It's nice to meet you. Can I get you a drink or something. <br>
LAKANTA: I have known that you were coming to us for the past two
years. Two years ago, I went into the Habak and began a vision quest.
While I was there I saw many things, talked to many animals, many
spirits. And I saw you. <br>
WESLEY: I don't think I understand. <br>

you seek.

It's as if somebody took my son away and left this stranger in his
place. <br>
PICARD: But in a sense, that's exactly what happened. Wesley left the
Enterprise three years ago he was a boy, and now he's returned a young
man. And that can't be easy for a mother or a son. <br>
CRUSHER: It's gone beyond just the two of us. <br>
PICARD: Yes, I heard about the incident with Geordi. <br>
CRUSHER: Have you heard what happened at the Academy? I called Admiral
Brand today. She said his grades are dropping, that he's becoming
remote and defensive. If he's not careful, he's going to wash out next
term. Maybe you should talk to him, Jean-Luc. Maybe it's the kind of
thing a boy, a man needs to discuss with another man. <br>
PICARD: I don't think he wants either of us to talk to him right now. <br>
CRUSHER: But he needs out help. <br>
PICARD: Beverly, he's got to want that help. If he doesn't, then any
efforts on our part can only push him further away. He's got to work
this out for himself.

WESLEY: Tell me about this Habak. You said you had some kind of a
vision there? <br>
LAKANTA: The Habak is holy to us. We hold our rituals and our
ceremonies there. It's sacred to us. What's sacred to you, Wesley? <br>
WESLEY: I don't know. I mean, I think a lot of things are important, I
have a lot of respect for things. But I don't really consider anything
sacred. <br>
LAKANTA: Look around us. What do you think is sacred to us here? <br>
WESLEY: Maybe the necklace you're wearing? The designs on the walls? <br>
LAKANTA: Everything is sacred to us. The buildings, the food, the sky,
the dirt beneath your feet. And you. Whether you believe in your spirit
or not, we believe in it. You are a sacred person here, Wesley. <br>
WESLEY: I think that's the first time anyone's used that particular
word to describe me. <br>
LAKANTA: So, if you are sacred, then you must treat yourself with
respect. To do otherwise is to desecrate something that is holy. <br>
WESLEY: Is that what you think I've been doing? <br>

Cardassian government in accordance with the terms of the border
agreement. I am very sorry, but you will have to leave. <br>

PICARD: I may regret doing it, but I am not able <br>
ANTHWARA: When you first came to us, we did not know why you were sent
by the Federation but we knew there must be a good reason. To us,
nothing that happens is truly random. So we searched for the true
reason you were sent. We did not find it until last night. Are you
familiar with the Pueblo Revolt of sixteen eighty? <br>
TROI: I am. Several Indian tribes rose up to overthrow their Spanish
overlords and drove them out of what is now called New Mexico. <br>
ANTHWARA: Ten years later, the Spanish returned to reconquer the area.
They were brutal. I would use the word savage. They killed hundreds of
our people. Thousands more were maimed. The name of one of the soldiers
was Javier Maribona-Picard. Your ancestor. <br>

WESLEY: What you're doing down there is wrong. These people are not
some random group of colonists. They're a unique culture with a history
that predates the Federation and Starfleet. <br>
PICARD: That does not alter the fact that my orders are to <br>
WESLEY: I know Admiral Necheyev gave you an order, and she was given an
order from the Federation Council. But it's still wrong. <br>
PICARD: That decision is not yours to make, Cadet. I don't know what
has got into you lately, and frankly right now I don't care. But I will
tell you this. While you wear that uniform, you will obey every order
you're given and you will conform to Starfleet regulations and rules of
conduct. Is that clear? <br>
WESLEY: Yes, sir, it is. But I won't be wearing this uniform any
longer. I'm resigning from the Academy. <br>
(Wesley puts his comm. badge on the table and leaves) <br>
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Captain. <br>
PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Gul Evek wants to meet with you to discuss the situation on
the surface. <br>
PICARD: Let him come aboard. I'll see him in here. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Aye, sir.

CRUSHER: Why are you doing this? <br>
WESLEY: I told you, Starfleet isn't for me. <br>
CRUSHER: Look, I may not be able to stop you from throwing away your
entire life, but you are going to stand here and explain it to me
first. You owe me that much. <br>
WESLEY: I saw Dad today. He told me not to follow him. <br>
CRUSHER: You what? <br>
WESLEY: I was participating in an Indian ritual and I had a vision. Dad
came to me and told me not to follow him. He said I had to find my own
path. <br>
CRUSHER: Is that what this is all about? A vision told you to leave the
Academy and now you're packing your bags? <br>
WESLEY: No. No, it's more than that. I've known I've needed to do this
for a long time. I just haven't been able to admit it to myself. <br>
CRUSHER: But you always said that being at the Academy was the best
thing that ever happened to you. <br>
WESLEY: I know. For a while it was. But as time went on and graduation
got closer, I started feeling really depressed. I thought maybe it was
the workload or the stress of being away from home, but it didn't go
away. It just got worse. <br>
CRUSHER: Why didn't you ever say anything? <br>
WESLEY: I didn't want to disappoint you or Captain Picard or my
friends. You guys were all so proud of me. <br>
CRUSHER: I'd be proud of you no matter what you were doing, Wesley. I
love you. <br>
WESLEY: I know, Mom. I guess the truth is that I was afraid of
disappointing myself. I never questioned the fact that I'd be in
Starfleet. But when Dad said not to follow him, it just made so much
sense. Everything is so clear now. <br>
CRUSHER: Maybe it is partly my fault. We didn't realised the kind of
pressure we were putting on you to be exactly what we expected you to
be <br>
WESLEY: I don't blame you at all. It is my decision. It always has
been. <br>
CRUSHER: You know that alien from Tau Ceti, the one who could control
warp fields with his mind? <br>
WESLEY: The Traveller. <br>
CRUSHER: He told Captain Picard a long time ago that you were very
special, like Mozart, and that you were destined for something quite
different from the rest of us. Maybe this is the first step. I love
you. <br>
WESLEY: I love you too, Mom.

GUL EVEK: Two of our men on the surface have been taken prisoner.
Prepare to send an armed squad of troopers to rescue them and to occupy
the village. <br>
PICARD: Gul Evek, those people are Federation citizens and I am sworn
to protect them. If your troops attack that village, my security forces

LAKANTA: I didn't do anything. You did. <br>
WESLEY: I did? <br>
LAKANTA: You pulled yourself out of their time. You took the first
step, Wesley. <br>
WESLEY: My first step to where? <br>
LAKANTA: To another plane of existence, another way of thinking. <br>
WESLEY: I don't understand. <br>
LAKANTA: You've found a new beginning for yourself. The first step on a
journey that few humans will ever take. <br>
WESLEY: Who are you? (Lakanta transforms) The Traveller. <br>

WESLEY: So all those things I saw in the Habak, my father, and the
things he said to me, that was your doing? <br>
TRAVELLER: I merely opened the door for you. What you experienced came
from your own mind, your own spirit if you wish.
I hoped that you would open your mind to new possibilities, and you
did. You pulled yourself out of time, don't you see? You've evolved to
a new level you're ready to explore places where thought and energy
combine in ways you can't even imagine. And I will be your guide, if
you would like. <br>
WESLEY: What about them? I can't just leave them like this. <br>
TRAVELLER: They must find their own destinies, Wesley. It's not our
place to interfere. <br>

their own.

They're requesting immediate assistance. What are your orders? <br>
PICARD: Evek, the last war caused massive destruction and cost millions

Not like this. Now the future lies in your hands right now. Give us one

your status as Federation citizens, any future request you or your
people make to Starfleet will go unanswered. You will be on your own

ANTHWARA: I understand, Captain. And we are prepared to take that risk.
Will the Cardassian government honour your agreement here? <br>
GUL EVEK: I believe I can convince them that this is an equitable
solution. I cannot speak for every Cardassian you may encounter, but if
you leave us alone I suspect that we will do the same. Will this be
acceptable to the Starfleet Command? <br>
PICARD: It will not be easy, but with Admiral Necheyev's support, I
think they will go along with it in the end. <br>
