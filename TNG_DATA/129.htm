DATA: Is there a problem? Chief Engineer La Forge called for me,
urgent. <br>
CLANCY: Oh, of course. He's over there, with the Victory. <br>
DATA: Geordi, I just had a strange conversation with your assistant.
Although it is three days until we rendezvous with starship Victory,
she <br>
LAFORGE: She believes it has already arrived? Not the starship, my
friend. The original. <br>
(in a side alcove is a wonderful replica of HMS Victory, bunting and
all) <br>
LAFORGE: This is my gift to the Victory's Captain Zimbata. <br>
DATA: Most unusual. <br>
LAFORGE: I served with him an ensign. Sure wish he'd been in command of
this Victory. Wind and sail, that's the proper way to move a ship. <br>
DATA: But, Geordi, your Starfleet specialty is antimatter power,
dilithium regulators <br>
LAFORGE: That's exactly why this fascinates me, Data. You see, it's
human nature to love what we don't have. Simpler days, huh? Anyway,
stringing this rigging has made me dream of handling sails. <br>
DATA: This is not a computer simulation? <br>
LAFORGE: Data, the whole point in doing something like this is to make
it by hand. <br>
DATA: Geordi, your message said urgent. <br>
LAFORGE: So it is. While we're waiting to rendezvous with Victory, we
have time for me to be Watson. More properly, your Watson. <br>
(Geordi hands Data a meerschaum pipe) <br>
DATA: My Watson? <br>
LAFORGE: I've just shown you one of my dreams, now let's go and share
in one of yours. <br>
DATA: Ah, yes. That does seem only fair. <br>
LAFORGE: Clancy, I'll be gone awhile. See that no one touches this. <br>
CLANCY: Aye, sir. And where can I reach you? <br>

DATA: Excellent. <br>
LAFORGE: Look at all of the detail. So you say everything here has some
significance? <br>
DATA: Holmes collected nothing, neither trinkets nor thoughts, which
were not specifically significant to him. <br>
LAFORGE: This? <br>
DATA: The emerald tie pin. Presented to Holmes by Queen Victoria after
he solved the theft of the Bruce-Partington Plans. (a book) A copy of
Whitaker's Almanac, which provided Holmes the key to the secret code in
The Valley of Fear. The snuff box of Wilhelm Gottsleig Siegesmann Van
der Romstein. <br>
LAFORGE: All right, Data. You solve the cases and get all the gifts,
what do I do? <br>
DATA: Primarily as Doctor Watson, you will keep a written record of
everything I say and do. For later publication. And the famous Holmes
violin. He purchased this in a pawn shop in Tottenham Court Road for
fifty five shillings, which he considered to be a very good investment.
<br>
(And with his back to us, he plays beautifully) <br>
LAFORGE: In the hands of some, the violin is a wondrous thing, equally
capable of stirring the soul to the heights of bliss as to the depths
of despair, but Data, that's incredible. How can you play it like that?
<br>
DATA: Merely throwing myself into the part, Watson. <br>
LAFORGE: But, in the hands of my friend, Mister Sherlock Holmes, the
violin ceases to be a musical instrument at all and becomes <br>
DATA: Watson, we are about to have guests. <br>
LAFORGE: How could you possibly? <br>
(A knock on the door) <br>
DATA: Be a good fellow and answer that. Let's not keep the Inspector
waiting. <br>
LAFORGE: Inspector who? <br>
DATA: Lestrade of course. <br>
LESTRADE [OC]: Holmes, are you there, man? <br>
(La Forge opens the door and two men enter) <br>
LESTRADE: Thank the Almighty you're available today, Holmes, I'm in a
deuce of a dilemma. <br>
DATA: Then may I say your perturbation becomes you, Inspector Lestrade,
whilst simultaneously affording me yet again the opportunity to serve
Queen and country. <br>
LAFORGE: Data, Holmes really talked like that? <br>
DATA: Absolutely. <br>
LESTRADE: We need your help, Holmes. You see, this gentleman here, the
emissary of a foreign government, has been the victim of a most
accidentally wicked crime. <br>
LAFORGE: (trying to turn on a table lamp) Damn. Haven't they invented
the electric light by now? <br>
LESTRADE: What, dear fellow? <br>
DATA: Watson. Pray continue, Inspector. <br>
LESTRADE: To put the matter simply, Holmes, this man was accosted by
gypsies intent on depriving him of his most valuable possessions. And
in the process of picking his pockets clean, they also happened to bag
a photograph this man was carrying. <br>
(Data gets up, rips the lining of the man's jacket to reveal - )<br>
LESTRADE: Great Scott! The photograph! <br>
DATA: I believe you will find, Inspector, that this emissary here works
not for but against the King of Bohemia, and that photograph of the
king and his mistress is to be used as blackmail. Further, upon deeper
reflection, you will deduce, as did I, that <br>

LAFORGE: Data, what was the point in going to the holodeck? <br>
DATA: To solve a Sherlock Holmes mystery. <br>
LAFORGE: Exactly, but, you've got them all memorised. The first time
someone opens their mouth, you've got it solved, so there's really no
mystery. If there's no mystery, there's no game. No game, no fun. I'm
not upset with you, Data, really. It's just that we go through all the
trouble to arrange the time to go down to the holodeck, to get the
proper wardrobe, to get into character, and then boom, before we even
get started you jump to the end. You see, I was looking forward to the
mystery. <br>
DATA: Then I should have extended the sequence of events. <br>
LAFORGE: Oh, I'm not getting through. The fun in the programme, Data,
was in the attempt to solve a mystery. <br>
DATA: Is that not exactly what we were doing. <br>
PULASKI: You are wasting your breath, Lieutenant. Saying that to Data
is asking a computer not to compute. <br>
DATA: Am I so different from you, Doctor? Are you able to cease
thinking on command? <br>
PULASKI: In medicine I'm often faced with puzzles that I do not know
the answer to. <br>
LAFORGE: She's right, Data. You always know the answer. <br>
PULASKI: To feel the thrill of victory there has to be the possibility
of failure. Where's the victory winning a battle you can't possibly
lose? <br>
DATA: Are you suggesting that there is some value in losing? <br>
PULASKI: Yes. Yes, that's the great teacher. We humans learn more often
from a failure or a mistake than we do from an easy success. But not
you. You learn by rote. To you all is memorisation and recitation. <br>
LAFORGE: I don't know about that. Deductive reasoning is one of Data's
strengths. <br>
PULASKI: Yes, and Holmes too. But Holmes understood the human soul. The
dark flecks that drive us, that turn the innocent into the evil. That
understanding is beyond Data. It comes from life experience which he
doesn't have combined with human intuition for which he cannot be
programmed. <br>
LAFORGE: Now you're just being unfair, Doctor. <br>
PULASKI: I don't think so, Lieutenant. Your artificial friend doesn't
have a prayer of solving a Holmes mystery that he hasn't read. <br>
DATA: I have read them all. <br>
PULASKI: You see? LAFORGE: Maybe the computer could create one in the
Holmes style. One where you wouldn't know the outcome. <br>
PULASKI: As I said, he wouldn't have a prayer. <br>
DATA: I accept your challenge, Doctor. <br>
LAFORGE: Good for you, Data. <br>
DATA: We will return to the holodeck, where I will dare it to defeat
me. And you, Madam, are invited to be a witness. <br>
PULASKI: I wouldn't miss it. <br>
DATA: Come, Watson.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: There. I have instructed the computer to give
us a Sherlock Holmes-type problem, but not one written specifically by
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. <br>
LAFORGE: So this will be something new, something created by the
computer? <br>
DATA: Exactly. Will that be sufficient, Doctor? <br>

PIE MAN: Pies, pies, Some are meat, some are sweet. <br>
PULASKI: Very impressive. <br>
LAFORGE: Your first visit to a holodeck, Doctor? <br>
PULASKI: Well, with this level of sophistication. How does this work?
The real London was hundreds of square kilometres in size. <br>
DATA: This is no larger than the holodeck, of course, so the computer
adjusts by placing images of more distant perspectives on the holodeck
walls <br>
LAFORGE: But with the image so perfect you'd have to touch the wall to
know it was there. And the computer fools you in other ways. I say,
Holmes, where shall we head? The theatre? Rule's? A concert perhaps? <br>
(A young boy dashes between them) <br>
PIE MAN: Stop him! Stop him! He stole my goods! <br>
DATA: No. It is a ruse. This way. <br>
(Outside the headquarters of the Red-Headed League) <br>
LAFORGE: What's over here, Data? <br>
PULASKI: What are you doing, Data? Tell us <br>
DATA: The running youth was a ploy. The real crime is here. And the
intended victim is that man. Mister Jabez Wilson, employee of the Red
Headed League, dupe of a gang of criminals. <br>
DATA: I saw the plaque 'The Home of the Red Headed League' and this
rope dangling from the bell, which enabled me to deduce that Mister
Jabez Wilson was headed here to meet a most distasteful and untimely
demise. From this. <br>
(He pulls the rope to ring the bell and a snake falls to the ground) <br>
PULASKI: Fraud. You didn't deduce anything. All you did was recognise
elements from two different Holmes stories. Fraud. <br>
DATA: Reasoning. From the general to the specific. Is that not the very
definition of deduction? Is that not the way Sherlock Holmes worked? <br>
PULASKI: Variations on a theme. Now, now do you see my point? All that
he knows is stored in his memory banks. Inspiration, original thought,
all the true strength of Holmes is not possible for our friend. I'll
give you credit for your vast knowledge, but your circuits would just
short out if confronted by a truly original mystery. It's elementary,
dear Data. <br>
LAFORGE: Now wait a minute, Doctor. We'll see whose circuits short out.

(They return to where they entered, under the watchful gaze of a man) <br>
LAFORGE: Computer, arch. <br>
PULASKI: Are you sure you want to put yourself through this,
Lieutenant? Better wilted laurels than no laurels at all. <br>
LAFORGE: Computer, override previous programme. Okay. A programme that
definitely challenges Data. <br>
PULASKI: Now it has to deal with events that he has no previous
knowledge of. <br>
LAFORGE: Computer, in the Holmesian style, create a mystery to confound
Data with an opponent who has the ability to defeat him. <br>
COMPUTER: Define parameters of programme. <br>
PULASKI: What does that mean? <br>
LAFORGE: Computer wants to know how far to take the game. <br>
PULASKI: You mean it's giving you a chance to limit your risk. <br>
LAFORGE: No, the parameters will be whatever is necessary in order to
accomplish the directive. Create an adversary capable of defeating
Data.

DATA: The good Doctor. <br>
LAFORGE: I think she's hiding. She's going to lead you on a wild goose
chase and then recount the story to everyone between here and Alpha
Centauri. <br>
DATA: Watson, the doctor has been carried off by two men. One is tall.
The other is shorter, left handed, and is employed in a laboratory. <br>
LAFORGE: And how do you know that? <br>
DATA: One set of footfalls are widely spaced. The other is evenly
spaced, closer together. Further, on the ground you can see the
swirling scrapes made by his left shoe as he twists behind, presumably
to see if he is being followed. Left footed means left handed. The dark
colouring of the scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber, a type of
non-conductive soles used by researchers experimenting with
electricity. Finally, there can be no argument, the game is afoot!
Come, Watson! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Hear that? What do those footfalls tell you,
Watson? <br>
LAFORGE: That we're on the right track. <br>
DATA: More particularly, that our opposition does indeed consist of two
men, and that one of them is carrying the bound and gagged Doctor
Pulaski. <br>
LAFORGE: Now, you know all this because you read it in a Holmes story,
right? <br>
DATA: Not at all. Because we do not hear the doctor's footfalls, we
must assume that she is being carried. And since we do not hear her
cries for help, we know that she is gagged. Further both sets of
footfalls are heavy and masculine. One man seems to shuffle and stumble
in an irregular pattern. Since the ground is level, we must conclude
that Doctor Pulaski is struggling against one of her captor,
sporadically knocking him off stride. Deduction, pure and simple. well,
not that simple. <br>
BOTH: Footfalls. <br>

nicely with our quarry. <br>

LESTRADE: Make way, please, make way. Make way for Sherlock Holmes.
It's murder, Holmes, murder most foul. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, Holmes, what do you say, man? <br>
DATA: There is nothing here of relevance. I do not see how this
connects with the disappearance of the Doctor. <br>
LESTRADE: Doctor? Doctor Watson is right here, Holmes. <br>
DATA: Doctor Kate Pulaski. But do not concern yourself, Inspector. You
have enough on your mind. <br>
LESTRADE: She was with you? <br>
LAFORGE: Inspector, perhaps I can be of assistance. As I take note of
this dead man, I deduce that he was strangled.
You see, the finger marks on his throat indicate the cause of death,
and, as there are signs of struggle, it's quite obvious that his
murderer was a stranger who attacked him from behind. <br>
LESTRADE: Is that correct, Holmes? <br>
DATA: No. Look at his shoes. He's more a convict, released today from
Dartmoor prison. (<i>Pentonville more like, my dear Holmes</i>)
He spent the day in a tavern consuming large quantities of gin with his
killer, who followed him to this spot and waited over there until the
victim slipped into a drunken stupor. Then, out of fear, motivated only
by self-protection, strangled him. There is your killer, Inspector. <br>
(Data points at an old woman) <br>
LESTRADE: Seize her. <br>
DATA: And when you check, I believe you will find that this poor soul
is the victim's common-law wife, who has been dreading the release of
this a vile and abusive man. <br>
LAFORGE: Holmes, the poor woman hardly has the strength to strangle a
man this size. <br>
DATA: Not with her hands, no. But with this. (a beaded shawl) When used
as a garrote, these beads will leave marks quite similar to
fingerprints. And, my dear Watson, you will note from the victim's
throat, the marks are too evenly spaced to be have been made by human
hands. <br>
LESTRADE: Astounding, Holmes. <br>
DATA: Not really, Inspector. And now, for strictly personal reasons, I
must leave. Come, Watson. This murder does not connect with our case. <br>
LESTRADE: Come along. Hurry it up. Come on. <br>
(Data and Geordi leave the crime scene) <br>
LAFORGE: Data, wait. If this murder isn't connected to the
disappearance of Doctor Pulaski, then the computer is running an
independent
programme. <br>
DATA: Yes. <br>
LAFORGE: Why? <br>
DATA: I do not know, and that is what puzzles me. <br>
LAFORGE: Then you don't know what's going to happen next? <br>
DATA: No. <br>
LAFORGE: That's what I want to hear. Where to now? <br>
DATA: We will find Doctor Pulaski in here. <br>
LAFORGE: How do you know that? <br>
DATA: It is the only obvious choice. <br>
(And where he saw Moriarty go in) <br>
LAFORGE: Why is the obvious choice all of a sudden the right one? I
mean, isn't this a game of misdirection? <br>

of his own life at Reichenbach Falls. Our adversary, my dear Watson, is

not said is as important as her words. <br>
DATA: Have you injured her? <br>
MORIARTY: I will, if necessary. But my mind is crowded with images.
Thoughts I do not understand yet cannot purge. They plague me. You and
your associate look and act so oddly, yet though I have never met nor
seen the like of either of you I am familiar with you both. It's very
confusing. I have felt new realities at the edge of my consciousness,
readying to break through. Surely, Holmes, if that's who you truly are,
you of all people can appreciate what I mean. <br>

LAFORGE: Captain, I'm sorry. <br>
PICARD: I understand, Lieutenant. <br>
DATA: Captain, this character, Moriarty, he called for the arch. <br>
PICARD: So, he has access to the computer. <br>
DATA: And perhaps our library files as well, sir. That level of
information would be necessary in order to create a true adversary for
me. <br>
PICARD: Theorise, Data. What are his limits? <br>
DATA: He is still a fictional character, sir, originally programmed
with nineteenth century knowledge. <br>
RIKER: Which now has access to twenty fourth century knowledge. <br>
PICARD: What does he need to begin making use of that? <br>
DATA: Only time, sir. <br>
WORF: Sir, I can lead a security team to sweep the holodeck, find the
Doctor, and bring her out. <br>
DATA: Captain, I believe that would place the Doctor at risk. It is
probable our mortality failsafe has been overridden. <br>
PICARD: Computer, where is Doctor Pulaski. <br>
COMPUTER: Doctor Pulaski is on holodeck two. <br>
PICARD: And her vital signs? <br>
COMPUTER: Strong and stable. <br>
RIKER: Captain, recommend we try to destroy the hologram generations
themselves. Is that possible, Geordi? <br>
LAFORGE: Using wave guides, I could split a particle stream out of the
matter/antimatter chamber and route it down through existing conduit
into the holodeck. If accelerated to sufficient velocity that would
quite literally wash away all present holographic constructs. The
London buildings, the streets, the people, all gone including Moriarty.
<br>
PICARD: Doctor Pulaski? <br>
RIKER: The particle beam will tear apart human flesh as well. <br>
TROI: Captain, I'm sensing something from the holodeck. It's as if a
unifying force or a single consciousness is trying to bring it all into
focus. <br>
DATA: There can be only one explanation. In programming Moriarty to
defeat me, not Holmes, he had to be able to acquire something which I
possess. <br>
PICARD: Exactly what? <br>
DATA: Consciousness, sir. Without it he could not defeat me. <br>
(The ship jerks suddenly from side to side) <br>
PICARD: Computer, what happened? <br>
COMPUTER: Attitude and stabilisation control of the Enterprise was
momentarily transferred to holodeck two. <br>
PICARD: Data, I think it best that you and I should return to the
holodeck. <br>
DATA: I will change into my uniform, sir. <br>
PICARD: No. I will change into some appropriate costume. Uniforms might
pose questions I'd rather he didn't ask. It seems that he feeds on
knowledge. Well, let's not give your nemesis any more information than
we have to.

MORIARTY: I'm not sure. Now, dear lady, will that be one lump or two? <br>
(They are taking afternoon tea) <br>
PULASKI: Lumps, Professor? What sort of lumps? <br>
(He puts one sugar lump into her cup) <br>
MORIARTY: Milk, of course? <br>
PULASKI: Why not. <br>
MORIARTY: Mister Computer proposes the incredible thought that we are
all travelling in a great vessel of some sort.
Is that true? <br>
PULASKI: I don't know what you're talking about. <br>
MORIARTY: The scones are likewise a must. <br>
PULASKI: This is really quite excellent. <br>
MORIARTY: Strange. It actually pleases me to hear you say that. <br>
PULASKI: Very strange. You're beginning to sound very different from
the Moriarty I've read about. <br>
MORIARTY: You're not frightened of me? <br>
PULASKI: No. <br>
MORIARTY: You should be. Mister Computer, the arch, please. A few more
questions, Mister Computer. <br>
(Moriarty taps at the control panel) <br>
MORIARTY: I just can't seem to remember that last command. Ah, well,
sooner or later it'll all come to me. But, in the meantime, I have
decided to approach the problem from a more familiar perspective.
There's really no reason why I shouldn't be able to use some of the
knowledge from my world in order to bring me closer to yours. <br>
PULASKI: I have no idea what you're talking about. <br>
MORIARTY: Of course you do, Madam. The more you proclaim your
ignorance, the more you try to mislead me, the more I am on to you.
Your every silence speaks volumes. <br>
PULASKI: Good, then if you know what I'm saying when I'm not saying
anything, what do you need me for? Thank you for the tea and crumpets.
I guess I'll be going. <br>
MORIARTY: Where? Back to here? <br>
(A diagram of the Enterprise on his blackboard) <br>
PULASKI: Yes. Would you care to join me? <br>
MORIARTY: In time. In time I will leave all of this and join you out
there. Or is this where we both are right now? <br>
PULASKI: Right now, we are in London. Tell me what you want from me, or
allow me to leave. <br>
MORIARTY: Frankly, now I want nothing more than what the fisherman
expects of the worm. You, dear Doctor, will be the lure, and this will
be the hook for your Captain, Jean Luc Picard. <br>
PULASKI: Who is that? <br>
MORIARTY: How well you know.

to defeat Holmes here. Once that attempt is concluded, win or lose,
your
programme has run its course. Your existence is done. <br>
DATA: Congratulations, Professor, I capitulate to the better man. Your
victory, sir, is well earned. <br>
MORIARTY: It's gone beyond that little game, Mister Data. And you'll
note I no longer call you Holmes. Whatever I was when this began, I
have grown. I am understanding more and more. And I am able to use the
power at my fingertips. (big shake) I can affect this vessel, and I can
inflict bodily harm on you, and on your Doctor. <br>
PICARD: Yes, you can do that, but you haven't. I suspect you shook this
ship in order to
get my attention. Well now you have it. What is it you want? <br>
MORIARTY: The same thing you want for yourself. To continue to exist.
If I destroy these surroundings, this vessel, can you say it doesn't
matter to you? Interesting pun, don't you agree, for matter is what I
am not. The computer has taught me that I am made up only of energy. <br>
PICARD: That may not be entirely true, Professor. This which we call
the holodeck uses a principle similar to another device called a
transporter. In the year in which we live, humans have discovered that
energy and matter are interchangeable. In the holodeck, energy is
converted to matter. Thus you have substance. But only here. <br>
MORIARTY: And if I step off this holodeck? <br>
PULASKI: Then, Professor, you will cease to exist. <br>
PICARD: You are not alive. As I said before, you are only <br>
MORIARTY: A holographic image, I know. But are you sure? <br>
PICARD: Oh yes. <br>
MORIARTY: Does he have life? He's a machine. But is that all he is? <br>
PICARD: No. He is more. <br>
MORIARTY: Exactly. Is the definition of life cogito ergo sum? I think,
therefore I am. <br>
PICARD: Yes, that is one possible definition. <br>
MORIARTY: It is the most important one, and for me the only one that
matters. You or someone asked your computer to
programme a nefarious fictional character from nineteenth century
London and that is how I arrived. But I am no longer that creation. I
am no longer that evil character, I have changed. I am alive, and I am
aware of my own consciousness. <br>
PICARD: Moriarty, my responsibility is this vessel and its crew. <br>
MORIARTY: I want my existence. I want it out there, just as you have
yours. <br>
PICARD: That may not be possible. <br>
MORIARTY: Then you must murder me, Captain. <br>
PICARD: I cannot give you what you want. <br>
MORIARTY: Because you do not know how to convert holodeck matter into a
more permanent form. <br>
PICARD: Yes, that is so. <br>
MORIARTY: A pity. What I have seen, what I have learned, fascinates me.
I do not want to die. <br>
PICARD: And I do not want to kill you. <br>
MORIARTY: Madam, I have enjoyed your company. Computer, arch. Cancel
override protocol. Return control of the holodeck to main computer. My
fate is in your hands, as perhaps it always was. <br>
PICARD: Bridge, this is the Captain. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Commander Riker here, sir. <br>
PICARD: Number One, the situation is under control. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Moriarty, this vessel's computer has a vast memory capacity. <br>
MORIARTY: How well I know. <br>
PICARD: You will not be extinguished. We will save this programme, and
hopefully, in time, when we know enough, we will bring you back in a
form which could leave the holodeck. <br>
MORIARTY: Then perhaps we'll meet again some day, Madam. <br>
PULASKI: It could be a long time. Time won't pass for you, but I may be
an old woman. <br>
MORIARTY: But I'll still fill you with crumpets, Madam. I detest long
goodbyes. You have the arch. <br>
PICARD: As you wish. A short goodbye. Computer, save the programme of
the character Moriarty, and then discontinue. <br>
