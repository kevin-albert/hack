Captain's log, stardate 44307.3. I am preparing to leave by
shuttlecraft for Pentarus Five, where I have been asked to mediate a
dispute among the salenite miners, a contentious group unfortunately
prone to violence. But first I must deal with a situation of a far more
personal nature.

WESLEY: Sir?&nbsp;<br>
PICARD: Mister Crusher, I summoned you almost ten minutes ago. <br>
WESLEY: Sir, I'm sorry. I was in the middle of a very important
experiment. I was using some very volatile compounds. I couldn't just
leave them lying out <br>
PICARD: Excuses, Mister Crusher? <br>
WESLEY: No, sir. I was just attempting to offer a <br>
PICARD: Because I can assure you that will not go down well at
Starfleet Academy. <br>
WESLEY: Yes, sir, I'm aware of that. The Academy? <br>
PICARD: I just received a message from Admiral Nsomeka. She expects you
to report in two weeks. A position has opened up in this year's class. <br>
WESLEY: Thank you. <br>
PICARD: Now, you'll have to work overtime in order to catch up, but I
have assured the Admiral that you are capable of that. Please don't
make a liar out of me. <br>
WESLEY: Oh, no, sir, I won't. <br>
PICARD: Well, for your final mission aboard the Enterprise you will
accompany me to Pentarus Five while I try to sort out the problems with
the miners. Commander Riker has told me you've been studying the
effects of outpost judiciary decisions on Federation Law. What better
way to get first hand experience? <br>
WORF: Captain, I am picking up a general distress signal from Gamelan
Five. <br>
PICARD: On screen. <br>
SONGI [on viewscreen]: Please. Does anyone read us? <br>
PICARD: Open a channel. I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation
Starship Enterprise. <br>
SONGI [on viewscreen]: Captain, I am Chairman Songi of Gamelan Four. An
unidentified spacecraft has entered orbit above our planet. Radiation
levels in our atmosphere have increased by three thousand percent. We
can only assume we are under attack, but the ship will not answer our
hails. We are a peaceful planet. We have no ability to defend
ourselves. Please, can you help us? <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, are we close enough for a scan? <br>
DATA: No, sir, we are out of range. <br>
RIKER: Any other ships in that sector? <br>
DATA: Negative, Commander. <br>
PICARD: Chairman Songi, we will proceed immediately to your planet. <br>
SONGI [on viewscreen]: Thank you, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Commander Riker, take the Enterprise and investigate the
problem. Ensign Crusher and I will proceed to Pentarus Five.
The miners have sent a shuttle. We shall leave in ten minutes. <br>

manoeuvring thrusters are rigged in a configuration I've never seen
before. <br>

if you want to. <br>
(say Hi! to Nick Tate, aka Eagle pilot Carter from Space 1999) <br>

LAFORGE: Excuse me, Captain. I've run safety and operational

any claims as to its comfort. <br>
DIRGO: Captain Picard. Captain Dirgo of the shuttlecraft Nenebek. <br>
PICARD: Ah, Captain. It's good to meet you. <br>
WESLEY: Captain? Of a mining shuttle? <br>
DIRGO: Yes, Ensign, Captain. My ship isn't pretty, she isn't big, but
we've logged almost ten thousand hours together. <br>
PICARD: Oh, yes. She seems a very sturdy craft. <br>
DIRGO: We should go. Captain, will you take Ops? <br>
PICARD: I'll let Ensign Crusher perform that task. I have to study up
on Regalian law.

WESLEY: Yes. <br>
DIRGO: Your Captain back there. If he isn't tougher than he looks,
those miners will tear him apart. <br>
WESLEY: Don't worry about Captain Picard. He'll handle them. <br>
(alarms come on and the lights go out) <br>
WESLEY: I've lost navigation. <br>
DIRGO: The port thruster quad's gone. Guidance coupling's severed. I
can't stabilise her. <br>

compartment) <br>
WESLEY: The port thruster module blew. <br>
DIRGO: Nenebek to Enterprise, emergency. Do you read? Pentarus station,
come in. Communication's gone. <br>
PICARD: Is your navigational system functioning? <br>
DIRGO: Negative. Switching to manual. Fifty million kilometres to
Pentarus Five. We may have to put down somewhere else. <br>
PICARD: Mister Crusher, scan for a class-M environment. <br>
WESLEY: Aye, sir. <br>
DIRGO: I'm going to have to throttle back on the main impulse engines. <br>
WESLEY: Sir, one of the moons around Pentarus Three registers as class
M, barely. The mean temperature is fifty five degrees Celsius. <br>
PICARD: Life forms indicated? <br>
WESLEY: Negative, but scanning is limited. There's a very strong
magnetic field around the surface. <br>
DIRGO: We don't have a choice. Save the impulse engine for controlled
entry. <br>
PICARD: Mister Crusher, reconfigure working thrusters to manual input. <br>
WESLEY: I'll try, sir but, this grid looks about a hundred years old. <br>
DIRGO: We don't have the Federation's resources. Captain, take the
helm. I'm rerouting the deuterium flow. Hull temperature seven hundred
degrees. <br>
PICARD: Beginning braking manoeuvre. <br>
DIRGO: We're below mach one. Bypass the thrusters now. <br>

PICARD: Dear God. Let's salvage what we can. The first thing we'll need
is shelter from the sun. In this heat, the shuttle will act like an
oven. <br>
DIRGO: All the systems are out. Can't get a communication channel.
Location transponder's gone too. <br>
PICARD: We'll have to check the craft for something to protect our
heads and eyes. And Captain, please recover your medical supplies, food
and water rations <br>
DIRGO: Well, the medical supplies are all right. <br>
PICARD: Food and water? <br>
DIRGO: The replicator, damaged beyond repair. <br>

DATA: Scanning. Vessel reads as an unmanned sublight freighter. <br>
RIKER: Origin? <br>
DATA: Indeterminate. Propulsion appears to employ a gaseous core
fission reactor, but it is not functioning. <br>
LAFORGE: The radiation levels from that ship are off the scale. <br>
RIKER: Could that be leakage from their engines? <br>
DATA: No, sir. Engine reactor elements appear to have been inactive for
approximately three hundred years. The vessel is carrying various
unstable waste products. <br>
LAFORGE: You mean, it's a garbage scow. <br>
DATA: Precisely. <br>
RIKER: Mister Worf, open a hailing frequency. Chairman Songi, this is
Commander Riker on board the Enterprise. <br>
SONGI [on viewscreen]: Yes, Commander. <br>
RIKER: It appears you've inherited someone else's problem. An old waste
vessel caught by your planet's gravitational pull. <br>
CRUSHER: Have your people begun to suffer from radiation sickness? <br>
SONGI [on viewscreen]: Not yet, but some areas are already detecting
dangerous levels. <br>
RIKER: We'll do our best to get it out of here as quickly as possible. <br>
SONGI [on viewscreen]: Thank you, Commander. <br>
RIKER: We're going to push that barge into the Gamelan sun. <br>
DATA: Sir, the Meltasion asteroid belt lies between here and the sun. <br>
RIKER: Then we'll have to take it ourselves. We'll use our deflectors
clear a path through the asteroids. <br>
LAFORGE: I don't like the idea of getting close enough to that barge to
tow it. The radiation levels are so high we'd be risking the
contamination of the entire crew. <br>
RIKER: Do you have a better idea, Geordi? <br>
LAFORGE: We could send over a construction module to attach thrusters
to it. Then we could direct it through the asteroid belt from a safe
distance. <br>
WORF: Commander, a message from the mining settlement on Pentarus Five.
The shuttlecraft carrying Captain Picard has not yet arrived. <br>
CRUSHER: They left here at oh eight hundred hours. <br>
WORF: They have asked if we are beginning a search. <br>
RIKER: Tell them we have an emergency situation. We'll begin a search
as soon as we've completed that. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
RIKER: Mister La Forge, prepare to launch the construction module. I'd
like to get this over with as fast as possible.

Wesley is working in the shadow of the shuttle) <br>
PICARD: Any luck with the tricorder, Ensign? <br>
WESLEY: I think so, sir. The scanning range may be a bit limited, but
it's better than nothing. <br>
DIRGO: These were on board, Captain. They're working. <br>
(weapons, on makeshift belts) <br>
PICARD: Excellent. Our communicators may not be able to get a signal
through this strong a magnetic field. I'm fashioning an arrow. If a
search party finds the wreckage, they'll know we've headed for those
mountains. <br>
(using brittle debris to make the pointer on the sand) <br>
DIRGO: Are you crazy? They're too far away. We'll never make it. <br>
PICARD: We can't survive in this sun. Where there's mountains, there's
shelter. <br>
DIRGO: You've got no right to make the decisions. I'm the captain of
this ship. <br>
WESLEY: If you want to get out of this, I suggest you listen to Captain
Picard. He's the one who's going to keep us alive. <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Ensign, that's enough. Captain Dirgo, you're an able
pilot. I welcome your input. Do you feel that there is an alternative
we're overlooking? <br>
DIRGO: No. <br>
PICARD: Very well. I suggest a steady pace, not a brisk one. We need to
ration our energy. Try breathing through your nose. That way it will
help to prevent dehydration. I'll lead. Captain Dirgo, will you bring
up the rear? <br>
(Dirgo says farewell to his ship, picks up the medical bag and off they
trudge) <br>
(Dirgo is the first one to stumble in the heat) <br>
WESLEY: And you were worried about how tough the Captain is? <br>
(Wesley walks off, and Dirgo takes a swig from a concealed bottle) <br>
(the mountains are a lot closer now) <br>
DIRGO: Did you find water? <br>
WESLEY: No, not yet. <br>
DIRGO: What are you doing with that? <br>
PICARD: Mister Crusher? <br>
WESLEY: I'm not sure, sir. It's an energy reading. <br>
PICARD: Energy reading? What kind? <br>
WESLEY: Low frequency EM. It's been getting stronger the closer we get
to those mountains. <br>
DIRGO: What are you saying? Is something over there, waiting for us? <br>
WESLEY: I'm not sure what it is. It just keeps registers as a repeating
energy pattern. <br>
PICARD: Ensign, are you suggesting this energy is not naturally
occurring? <br>
WESLEY: The readings could be indicative of some electromagnetic
properties in the rocks, but I don't think so. <br>
PICARD: A life form? <br>
WESLEY: It's possible. The pattern is fairly organised. <br>
PICARD: Well, we can't go back and we can't stay here. We've got to
keep going for the mountains. No matter what is waiting there.

PICARD: Not necessarily. This could be created by volcanic activity.
Lava flows. These walls are dry, Mister Crusher, do you have any
moisture reading? <br>
WESLEY: No, sir. But that EM reading? The pattern's changed. The
frequency's peaking a lot higher. <br>
(Dirgo accidentally drops his bottle while undoing his tunic) <br>
WESLEY: You have water! <br>
DIRGO: I wouldn't hide water. That's called dresci. It's from my
planet. <br>
PICARD: It's alcohol. <br>
DIRGO: It's medicinal. It's for emergencies. I was going to share it
with you. <br>
PICARD: This wouldn't quench your thirst, it would make it worse. <br>
DIRGO: I'll take my chances. <br>
PICARD: I'm not going to let you waste this. This is more valuable to
us as a coolant or disinfectant. <br>
DIRGO: It's mine. <br>
PICARD: Mister Crusher, stow that with the medical supplies. Keep your
eye on it. All right, we're going to explore the cave. Mister Crusher,
look for any signs of water, no matter how faint. Captain Dirgo, will
you lead the way?

That means it could respond to heat, or collinated energy. <br>
DIRGO: If you're right, we can use a phaser to lure it away. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Cold. <br>
WESLEY: When the sun went down, the temperature really dropped. This
should help. <br>
(Wesley heats rocks with a phaser) <br>
PICARD: Good. Thank you. I'm not much good to you, Wesley. <br>
WESLEY: Sir, Dirgo is dead. I should've tried harder to stop him, but
he. Captain! Captain Picard! Sir, stay with me. <br>
PICARD: I'm trying. <br>
WESLEY: Sir, do you remember when we took the shuttlecraft to Starbase
five one five? I was dreading it. Six hours alone with you. But it
didn't turn out the way that I thought. You opened up to me. I kind of
got to know you. <br>
PICARD: Wesley, it's my fault that you're here. I shouldn't have asked
you. <br>
WESLEY: Sir, I'm honoured you wanted me along. <br>
PICARD: I was selfish. I thought I wouldn't see you again. I'm sorry. <br>
WESLEY: Sir, in the past three years I've lived more than most people
do in a lifetime. I think I'm very lucky. no matter what happens. How
many people get to serve with Jean-Luc Picard? Sir, you don't know
this. No one knows this, because I never told anyone. All of the things
I've worked for, school, my science projects, getting into the Academy,
I've done it all because I want you to be proud of me. If there is one
thing that I've learned from you, it's that you don't quit. And I'm not
going to quit now. I've seen you think yourself out of worse problems
than this, and I'm going to think us out of this. You're not going to
die. I'm not going to let you die. I'll get to the water and I'll keep
you alive until they find us. I promise.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Are you certain? <br>
DATA: It is definitely debris. The primary material is duranium, with
smaller proportions of sonodanite and ermanium. <br>
LAFORGE: Most shuttlecraft hulls are made of duranium. <br>
CRUSHER: Then they're gone. <br>
DATA: Not necessarily, Doctor. There is far too little debris to
account for an entire shuttlecraft. <br>
RIKER: So what is it? <br>
LAFORGE: You know, Dirgo had his manoeuvring thrusters rigged a funny
way. Claimed it was more efficient. If one of them blew it might have
left debris like that. <br>
RIKER: If only one of his thrusters was out, he could still have set
down somewhere. <br>
DATA: The only Class M planets in the system are Pentarus two and five,
both of which have been thoroughly searched by the miners. <br>
RIKER: Then we'll search them again. <br>
DATA: Sir, there are also four moons in the Pentarus system that could
support life. <br>
RIKER: Have the miners searched them? <br>
WORF: Not yet, sir. <br>
RIKER: Which one is the closest one to the debris coordinates? <br>
DATA: Lambda Paz, one of the moons of Pentarus three. <br>
RIKER: Set a course, Ensign.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Aupres de ma blonde, il fait bon, fait bon,
fait bon. Ensign, where are we? <br>
WESLEY: We crashed, sir. We're in a cave. <br>
PICARD: I need water. <br>
WESLEY: Sir, we don't have any water. Don't you remember? We tried to
get to the fountain and Captain Dirgo <br>
PICARD: Yes, I remember. <br>
WESLEY: I think I'm on to something. I've analysed the sentry's energy
patterns. <br>
PICARD: Wesley, I may not make it. <br>
WESLEY: I've taken the transponder element from my communicator and
I've used it to modify my tricorder. <br>
PICARD: No, listen. <br>
WESLEY: I think I can use it to interrupt the sentry's electrical
pattern. Stop it, maybe slow it down. <br>
PICARD: Listen to me. <br>
WESLEY: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: There's so much I wanted to tell you. The Academy, there's
someone, someone who meant a great deal to me. He's been there forever.
Someone you must get to know. His name is Boothby. Now, you tell him
that you and I were friends. Now, when I was there, he helped me.
Listen to him. <br>
WESLEY: What does he teach? <br>
PICARD: He's the groundskeeper. One of the wisest men I ever knew. Oh,
I envy you, Wesley Crusher. You're just at the beginning of the
adventure. Go on. Get the water. Stay alive. They'll find you. <br>
WESLEY: I'll be back soon. <br>
PICARD: Of course. Wesley. You remember I was always proud of you. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Wesley fires his phaser at the fountain, then uses
his rigged tricorder to stop the sentry in its tracks. He frantically
taps at the device until suddenly the sentry flies through him to the
fountain, and the forcefield -which hadn't been there when he had his
back to it - slowly evaporates. Wesley cautiously approaches the
fountain) <br>

WESLEY: How did you find us? <br>
CRUSHER: We found the wreckage, and the arrow which indicated your
direction. We'll take Wesley by stretcher as well. <br>
WESLEY: No, I can walk. <br>
PICARD: Doctor. <br>
CRUSHER: We're taking you back to the Enterprise. We've stabilised your
vital signs. All right, let's go now. <br>
PICARD: One moment. Mister Crusher? <br>
WESLEY: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: What are you doing in such a filthy uniform? <br>
WESLEY: You don't look so ship-shape yourself, sir. <br>
PICARD: Wesley, you will be missed. </font> </p>
