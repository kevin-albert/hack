log, Stardate 42437.5. Ira Graves is arguably the greatest human mind
in the universe. For years he's lived in near isolation on a remote
planet, devoting full time to his research. Eight hours ago, we
monitored a message from his assistant, urgently requesting medical
aid. I only hope we can reach him in time. </font>

<br>
WORF: Nothing sir. Not since their initial communication. <br>
RIKER: They send out a plea for help, then they cut off transmission so
they can't tell if there's any help on the way. Doesn't make much
sense, does it? <br>
PICARD: Ensign, what's our ETA at the planet? <br>
WESLEY: Thirty six minutes to orbit, sir. <br>
PICARD: Starfleet Command considers Graves' work on molecular
cybernetics is reaching a critical stage. They consider this a priority
one action. <br>
PULASKI: A man is ill, Captain. Treating him is my priority one,
regardless of who he is.

TROI: How so? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, if I didn't know better, I'd say he was showing signs of
insecurity. <br>
TROI: Yes, but you do know better. Androids don't feel such things. <br>
LAFORGE: I don't know. Sometimes I think he's becoming more human than

LAFORGE: Can we come in? <br>
DATA [OC]: Please. <br>

LAFORGE: Did you damage your face, Data? <br>
DATA: It is a beard, Geordi. A fine, full, dignified beard. One which
commands respect and projects thoughtfulness and dignity. Well?
Opinions? <br>
TROI: It's er, very different. <br>

please send a doctor. Things are getting worse. <br>

WORF: Our records show that she and Graves are the only ones living on

RIKER: Then what scared her? <br>
WORF: Captain, I am picking up another signal, but it is not from the

PICARD: On screen, Mister Worf. <br>
WORF: The signal is very weak, sir. Audio only. <br>
PICARD: Pipe it through. <br>
MAN [OC]: Mayday! Mayday! This is the USS (static) questing emergency
assistance.
(static) The outer hull is breached and environmental systems
compromised. Need assistance. <br>
WESLEY: Captain, I show the Constantinople in that general vicinity.
She's a transport ship, used to ferry settlers. I'm showing two
thousand and twelve colonists aboard. <br>
RIKER: Outer hull breach. She must have had an internal explosion. <br>
PULASKI: If that's the case, they'll all be prone to severe hypoxia.
Their lives are at risk. We've got to help them. <br>
PICARD: And what about Graves? <br>
PULASKI: He's one man. <br>
RIKER: Suggestion, Captain. Why don't we execute a long range transport
of an away team to assist Doctor Graves at earliest possible moment.
We'd come out of warp just long enough to energise the beam. <br>
PICARD: A touch and go down warping? Mister Crusher, prepare to make it
so. <br>

KAREEN: I'm sorry, I couldn't take the chance. <br>
TROI: Chance? What chance? <br>
(A door opens and a crotchety old man enters) <br>
GRAVES: The chance that I might find out someone was coming. Kareen

KAREEN: I had no choice. I refuse to stand by and watch you

noticed? <br>
KAREEN: He has pain, shortness of breath, irritability. <br>
GRAVES: Ridiculous! I'm as healthy as a Rigelian ox! <br>

GRAVES: Nonsense! <br>
KAREEN: Ira! <br>
SELAR: I am a doctor. Lieutenant Selar. <br>
GRAVES: No offense, but I don't want you touching me in any way. It's
no secret that I don't like people much, and I like doctors even less. <br>
TROI: That's funny, I thought most doctors were people. <br>
GRAVES: Then you're wrong. Ask any patient. Although I will admit, for
a doctor you're not a bad looking woman. Well, well, well, what have we
got here? Another lovely specimen of womanhood. <br>

GRAVES: Women aren't people. They're women. (he kisses her hand) <br>

GRAVES: Yes, of course it is. This is one of the truly great moments of
your life. <br>
KAREEN: Excuse me, sir. Are you a Romulan? <br>
WORF: Hardly. <br>
GRAVES: He's a Klingon, Kareen. Kareen has lived here since her father
died when she was very young. Her only knowledge of unhuman races comes
from me. Klingons and Romulans don't look much alike, Kareen, even
though they act much alike. <br>
WORF: Must I stand here and be insulted? <br>
GRAVES: No insult intended, Mister Klingon. You see, Doctor, there's
nothing wrong with my hearing. My, my, my, my. <br>
DATA: Lieutenant Commander Data <br>
GRAVES: Shhh! Absolutely no aesthetic value whatsoever. Looks like
Soong's work. <br>
(Selar is examining Graves behind his back) <br>
DATA: Quite correct, sir! Did you know Doctor Soong? <br>
GRAVES: Know him?! I taught him everything he knows. You could say that
I was the father of his work. Which kind of makes me your grandfather,
doesn't it sonny? Damn doctors! Always sneaking up on one. Attacking
from the rear. Go on, gorgeous. Spit it out. Whatever the hell it is, I
can take it. <br>
SELAR: I've checked twice to make certain. You have Darnay's disease.
I'm sorry, Doctor Graves. It's in it's final stage. <br>
KAREEN: Can't you do something for him? <br>
SELAR: In all cases, Darnay's is terminal. </font></p>

GRAVES: Call me Grandpa. Seems more touching in my final hours. <br>
DATA: I have noticed, Grandpa, that you keep repeating the same notes
of a musical phrase I am unfamiliar with. <br>
GRAVES: It's an ancient little tune called 'If I Only Had A Heart.' A
plaintive lament sung by a mechanical man who longs to be human. It's
his only wish. <br>
DATA: What happens to this man? <br>
GRAVES: He finds out he's human after all. Always was. Just worried so
much, he never realised it. <br>
DATA: A happy ending. The mechanical man gets his wish. <br>
GRAVES: Stories often have happy endings. It's life that throws you for
a loop. It must be so hard for you, to be so close to being human and
yet never really knowing what it's like to know pain. <br>
DATA: But pain is unpleasant, is it not? <br>
GRAVES: Pain. Lust. Envy. Pleasure. Desire. Do you know what desire is,
Data? <br>

GRAVES: Do you know what desire is? <br>
DATA: No. I do not suppose I will ever really know. <br>
GRAVES: I feel pity for you. Your existence must be a kind of walking
purgatory. Neither dead nor alive. Never really feeling anything. Just
existing. Just existing. Listen to me. A dying man takes the time to
mourn a man who will never know death. Funny, isn't it? <br>

DATA: But the Doctor <br>
GRAVES: Oh, I'll die, but I won't really be dead. You see, I believe
I've learned to transfer the wealth of my knowledge into
a computer. Before I die, I plan to transfer my great intelligence into
this machine, thus cheating the Grim Reaper of his greatest prize. But
what would you know of death? It is a subject forever alien to you. <br>
DATA: That is not necessarily true, Grandpa. I do have an off button,
if you will. Its activation robs me of my consciousness, therefore
rendering me dead for all intents and purposes. It is not something I
enjoy contemplating. <br>

device? Don't tell me, let me guess.

Just look at that face. The face of a thinker. A warrior. A man for all
seasons. Yes, Ira Graves was all that and more. But he was not perfect.
Perhaps his greatest fault was that he was too selfless. He cared too
much for his fellow man, with nary a thought for himself. A man of
limitless accomplishments, and unbridled modesty. I can safely say that
to know him was to love him. And to love him was to know him. Those who

projects. Watch the screen and let your mind go blank. The device will
do the rest. <br>

flashes on a screen, including a waterfall, Kareen, fire, Graves,
Tasha, Kareen again, Picard and other crew members. They get faster and
he gets more tense)

friend. Is it possible to speculate about what's happening to him? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, sir, it's just a guess, but, sometimes he wants to be
human so badly he can taste it. I think he just tends to get confused
when his human qualities surface. <br>
PICARD: Go on. <br>

for the way he <br>
(Troi enters, interrupting) <br>
TROI: I have the results of the tests. I ran them several times to be
sure. <br>
PICARD: To be sure of what? <br>
TROI: There are two disparate personalities within Lieutenant Commander
Data. Each distinctly different. A dominant and a recessive. <br>
PICARD: But he's an android. Is that possible! <br>
TROI: It must be. The dominant personality is unstable. Brilliant but
vain, sensitive yet paranoid. And I believe it is prone to
irrationality. <br>
PICARD: Of course. <br>
TROI: Sir? <br>
PICARD: Nothing. Go on. <br>
TROI: It seems to have an especially strong hatred of you, Captain, or
to a lesser degree, any authority figure. And worst part is, it's
growing. <br>
PICARD: How do you mean? <br>
TROI: The alien persona is getting stronger and gobbling up what is
left of the weaker ego, the Data we know. If something isn't done to
stop it immediately, we will lose our Data forever. </font></p>

PICARD: Doctor, what was your impression of Graves? <br>

PICARD: I came here to talk to Data. <br>
DATA: I cannot allow that. <br>
PICARD: I understand your desperation. The shock of learning you were
dying. But you had no right to do what you have done. <br>
DATA: I had every right, Captain. I am man, he is machine. There is no
question who must live and what must die. <br>
PICARD: What of Data? <br>
DATA: Data? Before me, he was nothing. Just a walking tin can with
circuits for intestines. Pathetic. Without heart, a man is meaningless.
I would not come up here if I were you, Captain. I might not like it. <br>

floor) <br>

PICARD: Not a violent man? <br>
DATA: (refers to Geordi) This is not my fault. They told me I was not
supposed to be up here. They should not have done that. <br>
PICARD: Graves, listen to me. No one can deny the significance of your
transformation. But I don't believe that this was part of your plan.
Encountering Data was mere coincidence. One that offered you more than
you could have dreamed. But something has gone wrong. Look here.
Graves, this experiment must be terminated. <br>

PULASKI [OC]: Yes, Captain. <br>
PICARD: How is Miss Brianon? <br>
PULASKI [OC]: Her left hand is fractured in two places. We've just

PULASKI [OC]: I'm on my way. <br>

But you've cheated. You have extended your life at the expense of
another. Graves, give Data back. Give him back. <br>
DATA: Data is dead. <br>
PICARD: No. He must not be lost. He's not simply an android. He's a
life form, entirely unique. <br>
DATA: Data is not human! He is <br>
PICARD: He is different, yes. But that does not make him expendable, or
any less significant. No being is so important that he can usurp the
