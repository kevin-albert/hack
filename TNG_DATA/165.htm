Commander Kurn is accorded all the rights and responsibilities due the
first officer of this ship. If he should feel patronised in any way <br>
RIKER: I'm sure we'd know. One does not patronise a Klingon warrior. <br>
PICARD: Your experience on board the Pagh will prove invaluable during
the commander's tour. Be sure that the crew is prepared for any unusual
orders. <br>
RIKER: The Klingons are very thorough. I'm sure Commander Kurn has
studied for his assignment just as I did when I served with them. <br>
PICARD: I understand that he requested the Enterprise specifically.

PICARD: Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Commander. I'm Captain Picard.
This is Commander William Riker. He will be yielding the first
officer's position to you during your tour. <br>
KURN: You are relieved. May I take my station, Captain? <br>
RIKER: I thought that I might show you your quarters first. <br>
KURN: I am ready for duty, sir. I ask that I be allowed to take my
station. <br>
PICARD: Very well. If you will accompany us to the Bridge.

Force. You will address me as Commander or sir at all times.
I am fully aware of all Starfleet regulations and they will be strictly
adhered to by all personnel while I am in command. It is my intention
to bring a sense of discipline that you may not be accustomed to. With
your permission, of course, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Oh, by all means, Commander. <br>
KURN: I have studied all of your service records. Impressive. We shall
see if you live up to your reputations. Do you wish to speak, Acting
Ensign Wesley Crusher? <br>
WESLEY: No, sir, Commander, sir. <br>
KURN: The crew awaits your orders, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Then take us to the outer cometary cloud, Commander. <br>
KURN: Set course one one four mark two three zero, one third impulse

WESLEY: He just doesn't seem to like me. I can't do anything right for
him. Every time I respond to an order he jumps down my throat. I don't
know what I'm doing wrong. <br>
RIKER: Problem, Geordi? <br>
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. It's our new first officer. <br>
RIKER: I take it he found something wrong in Engineering? <br>
LAFORGE: Just the entire section. He pulled a surprise inspection in
the middle of a maintenance cycle! I tried to explain it to him <br>
RIKER: But he wouldn't listen. <br>
LAFORGE: We're all going to be doing double shifts down there just to
ready for the next inspection. <br>
RIKER: His style of command is just different. Klingons believe in
obedience and a strict formality of command. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, but this isn't a Klingon vessel. He's going to have to
loosen up, Commander. <br>
WESLEY: It's not just us. He's been leaning into everybody pretty hard,
except <br>
LAFORGE: Except the one guy who wouldn't really mind it.

KURN: Excellent. Please scan the asteroid field for me, Lieutenant, and

WORF: Approximately two thousand small objects. None in our direct

Sir. I would like to make one suggestion, sir. <br>
KURN: A suggestion? <br>
RIKER: When I served aboard the Pagh, the hardest part for me was
recognising and adapting to the demands of the crew. They needed an
iron hand. I imagine it must be very difficult for you to work with a
crew that is so different. I would be happy to guide you in that
regard, if it would be helpful. <br>
KURN: No, Commander. It wouldn't. </font></p>

KURN: How long has the bird been dead? It appears to have been lying in
the sun for quite some time. <br>
LAFORGE: It's not dead, it's been replicated. You do understand that we
cook most of our foods. <br>
KURN: Ah, yes. I was told to prepare for that. I shall try some of your
burned replicated bird meat. <br>
(He rips off a leg and plonks it on his plate) <br>
PICARD: I have attempted to select a menu that will allow you to sample
a variety of dishes, Commander. <br>
CRUSHER: Try some caviar. <br>
KURN: The odour is not palatable. What is it? <br>
DATA: The unhatched eggs of a large scaleless <br>
PICARD: Later, Data. A fish, Commander. A delicacy from the Caspian Sea
on Earth It's a favourite of mine. Our replicator's never done it
justice, but I managed to store a few cases for special occasions. <br>
KURN: I am honoured, Captain. <br>
(They all sit round the table) <br>
TROI: Are you adjusting to your new environment, Commander? <br>
(Kurn starts eating. No one else is) <br>
KURN: I find the constraints a bit difficult to conform to. Just a
short while ago, I had to stop myself from killing Commander Riker. I
believe he was trying to communicate the crew's sense of discomfort
with my style of command. Under different circumstances, I would
consider that a challenge to my authority. <br>
PICARD: One of the aims of the exchange programme, Commander, is for
all of us to learn tolerance. As for my crew, it may be healthy to
shake up the status quo occasionally. <br>
RIKER: The Commander certainly appears to have the crew on its toes <br>
LAFORGE: And then some. No offence, sir. <br>
KURN: None taken. I never kill anyone at the supper table, Mister La
Forge. <br>
CRUSHER: Don't you like it, Commander? <br>
KURN: Our food has much more taste to it. While I'm sure this is well
prepared, it is far too bland for the stomach of a Klingon. <br>

WORF: I have questions I wish to pose. <br>
KURN: Are your quarters so comfortable? <br>
WORF: They serve me. <br>
KURN: This entire ship seems built on comfort, relaxation, being at
ease. It is not the ship of a warrior, not the ship of a Klingon. You
cannot ask these questions within the boundaries of protocol? <br>
WORF: They are of a personal nature, sir. <br>
KURN: Permission granted. Pose your questions. <br>
WORF: I wish to know if I have given you offence. <br>
KURN: I am not human. If you had given offence, you would not need to
ask. <br>
WORF: Perhaps I have not performed my duties to your satisfaction? <br>
KURN: I find you to be a capable Starfleet officer. A credit to your
ship. <br>
WORF: Yet you dishonour me at every opportunity. <br>
KURN: Have I? I did not know that being polite to a Starfleet officer
would bring dishonour on him. <br>
WORF: I am a Klingon. <br>
KURN: Really? Perhaps your blood has thinned in this environment. I
simply don't want to hurt you. <br>
(Worf throws a chair across the room in rage) <br>
KURN: mev yap! So your blood is not so thin after all. <br>
WORF: I am a Klingon! if you doubt it, a demonstration can be arranged.
<br>
KURN: That is the response of a Klingon. The response I would expect
from my older brother. <br>
(collective gasps and a quick advert break) <br>
KURN: I was barely a year old when you left for the Khitomer Outpost.
You, our mother and father were not going to stay long. It was decided
that I did not need to go. I was left to stay with our father's friend,
Lorgh, until you returned. You never did. <br>
WORF: The Starfleet officer that rescued me was told by the Klingon
High Command that I had no living relatives. <br>
KURN: They assumed that I was killed with the family at Khitomer. Lorgh
had no sons. He took me into his family. It was not until I had reached
the Age of Ascension that I was told the truth. <br>
WORF: So you asked to serve aboard the Enterprise to watch me. <br>
KURN: It was an excellent opportunity to see what kind of Klingon you
were, or if you were Klingon at all. <br>
WORF: Your deception offends me, brother. <br>
KURN: It should. But it was required. <br>
WORF: To satisfy your curiosity. <br>
KURN: No. Much more. You are the eldest son. The challenge is yours to
make. <br>
WORF: Challenge? <br>
KURN: The Klingon High Council has judged our father a traitor to the
Empire.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: What are the allegations, Worf? <br>
WORF: My father is accused of aiding and abetting the Romulan attack on
the Khitomer outpost. <br>
PICARD: The attack in which he himself was killed? But why now, after
twenty years? <br>
WORF: I do not know, Captain. I will hear the evidence when I arrive.
The charge has been made by Duras, the son of my father's greatest
rival. Our family name will be disgraced for seven generations. It is
my responsibility to clear his name or answer for his crimes. <br>
PICARD: Answer for them? <br>
WORF: The family of a Klingon warrior is responsible for his actions
and he is responsible for theirs. If I fail in my challenge, I will be
executed. Will you grant my leave, Captain? <br>
PICARD: No. If I understand correctly, a Starfleet officer, a respected
member of my crew, could be accused of a capital crime. Your actions in
this matter will reflect on this ship and on the Federation. Therefore,
it seems only appropriate that your captain should be at your side
while you make your challenge. I'm sure you would do no less for me. </font></p>

honour means more to him than his life. Perhaps your human values have
clouded your judgment. I insist. <br>

outsiders to our Great Hall. <br>

the Enterprise. <br>
DURAS: Your words mean nothing here. <br>
K'MPEC: Duras, let him speak. <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant Worf has served under my command with distinction.
He has earned my admiration and my respect. It is my greatest wish that
this Council, in its wisdom, will clear his family name and return him
to duty. <br>
K'MPEC: The trust of a commanding officer is admirable. The council has
noted it. Speak the accusation. <br>
DURAS: For many turns, the truth about Khitomer has lain dormant.
Unknown. Now the truth has been revealed. The traitor Mogh sent the
defence access codes to the Romulan patrol ships, allowing them to
destroy the outpost. Thousands died on Khitomer. My father died on
Khitomer. Their deaths must be avenged. Your father was a traitor. By
posing this challenge, you are a traitor. <br>

your challenge can only result in a fool's death. <br>

charges against Worf's father. Apparently the Klingons recently
captured a Romulan ship with logs that provided new information on the
Khitomer attack. They clearly indicate a transmission from the outpost
to the Romulan ship moments before the shields went down. <br>
LAFORGE: From Worf's father? <br>
DATA: They do correspond to Mogh's personal security code. <br>
RIKER: How can we be sure these records haven't been falsified? <br>
LAFORGE: We can cross check them against the Intrepid's sensor logs. <br>
DATA: I will try, but the Intrepid was at the edge of sensor range
during the attack and we cannot be sure if the scan was complete. <br>
LAFORGE: Looks like a pretty good match-up, Data <br>
DATA: Both the Intrepid and Romulan logs show a series of distress
signals from Khitomer. <br>
RIKER: What happened there. <br>
LAFORGE: Those are gaps in the Intrepid's logs. Missing information due
to the range. <br>
DATA: That is where Mogh's alleged transmission should be. <br>
RIKER: Right in the middle of the gap? <br>
LAFORGE: Wait a second, Data. Back up. Just before the Intrepid's gap
begins, the timebase of both files are in perfect sync. But look. Look
at what happens to the signal after the shields are dropped. <br>
DATA: They are no longer synchronous. <br>

the shields fell. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Captain Picard. <br>
PICARD: Stand by. <br>
DURAS: The Khitomer commander noted in his log that Mogh had been
acting suspiciously. <br>
(Picard moves away to take his call privately) <br>
PICARD: Go ahead, Number One.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: We've located another survivor of the
Khitomer massacre, Captain a woman who was found with Worf. Her name is
Kahlest. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Great Hall]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: She resides in the Old Quarter of the First
City. <br>
PICARD: Well done. Picard out. <br>
DURAS: Another witness has testified that Mogh often spoke of his
admiration for the Romulans. Their culture. Their women. Mogh betrayed
us, and four thousand Klingons died on Khitomer. Only the son of Mogh
survived. <br>
PICARD: K'mpec. May we have a short recess? <br>
K'MPEC: Len'mat. <br>
(K'Mpec gets up and walks out) <br>
PICARD: Have you heard of a woman named Kahlest? <br>
WORF: She was my ghojmoK, my nurse. <br>
PICARD: It is possible she was an eyewitness to your father's
activities on Khitomer. <br>
WORF: But she died in the attack. <br>
PICARD: No, she survived. She's living in the Old Quarter. I'm going to
find her. <br>
WORF: It is too dangerous. You must not go alone. <br>
PICARD: Hey, I'm your cha'DIch.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Picard wears a long robe and hood to disguise his
race and uniform) <br>
PICARD: Kahlest? <br>
KAHLEST: What do you want? <br>
PICARD: Your help. <br>
KAHLEST: No. <br>
PICARD: You don't even know what I want. <br>
KAHLEST: You are cha'Dich. I know. <br>
PICARD: Then you also know that Worf's life is at stake. <br>
KAHLEST: I cannot help. I am dead. A long time dead. <br>
PICARD: Were you with Worf's father just before the attack on Khitomer?
<br>
KAHLEST: No. My life ended on Khitomer. I served a proud family, a
strong house. All that is gone. <br>
PICARD: Worf is not gone. The family you served needs you again. <br>
KAHLEST: I cannot help. <br>
PICARD: Was his father a traitor? <br>
KAHLEST: No. Mogh was loyal to the Emperor. Mogh suspected someone of
plotting with the Romulans and followed them to Khitomer. <br>
PICARD: Who? Who was the traitor? <br>
KAHLEST: I do not know. <br>
PICARD: Then we have no way to prove Mogh's innocence, and Worf will
die as the son of a traitor. <br>
KAHLEST: You must leave now, cha'DIch. I am dead.

draw the dagger and stabs one of them. Kahlest gets the other one in
the back) <br>
PICARD: My appreciation, madam. <br>
KAHLEST: You are brave, cha'DIch. Worf chose well. <br>
PICARD: Kahlest, would they recognise you? Would they know who your
are? <br>
KAHLEST: K'mpec would remember Kahlest. I caught his eye back then, but
he was too fat. <br>
PICARD: Come back with me. They won't know how much you know. You may
shake loose the truth. <br>
KAHLEST: I will come.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Great Hall]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DURAS: The evidence is clear. I would ask that the
judgment stand. That Worf be condemned as the son of a traitor to the
Empire. <br>
K'MPEC: Worf, son of Mogh, the judgement of <br>
PICARD: K'mpec! <br>
(Picard enters with Kahlest) <br>
PICARD: The Mek'ba is not complete. I bring an eyewitness to the
Khitomer massacre, one who has new evidence, K'mpec. <br>
KAHLEST: Mogh was innocent. <br>
K'MPEC: Len'mat.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[K'mpec's Chamber]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DURAS: What is it you think you know, old woman? <br>
PICARD: Do not answer. It is the rule of the Mek'ba that evidence be
presented in open council. <br>
DURAS: She will die before she gives evidence. <br>
K'MPEC: Be silent, Duras. Would you kill an old women to cover your
dishonour? <br>
PICARD: Yes. It is your dishonour we are protecting here, isn't it,
Duras? <br>
DURAS: I have no reluctance to kill you, human. <br>
PICARD: Are you prepared to hear her evidence in open council? <br>
K'MPEC: Obviously, we would not. Kahlest, you can go now. It is good to
see you again. <br>
KAHLEST: You are still fat, K'mpec. <br>
(Kahlest leaves) <br>
K'MPEC: I asked you to leave, to let this challenge go unanswered, but
you did not hear my words. And now it's come to this. <br>
WORF: Why did you judge my father guilty when you knew he was not? <br>
K'MPEC: Someone had to be blamed. The warriors who captured the Romulan
ship had learned of the treachery, but only the Council knew whose
security code had been transmitted. Ja'rod, father of Duras. <br>
WORF: This ha'DIbaH should have been fed to the dogs! <br>
K'MPEC: His family is powerful. If the truth were known, it would
shatter the Council, most certainly plunge us into civil war. You were
in Starfleet. We did not expect you to challenge the judgment, nor did
we know there was another son of Mogh. <br>
PICARD: Worf's challenge is successful. The honour of his family must
be restored. <br>
K'MPEC: You do not understand. His challenge was defeated before he
ever made it. You will not be allowed to present this evidence. The
judgment stands. You will be condemned. So will your brother. There is
no other way now. <br>
PICARD: You admit the truth and yet expect him to accept punishment?
What does this say of an Empire who holds honour so dear? <br>
K'MPEC: The Empire will not be destroyed for one family's honour. <br>
PICARD: Unacceptable, K'mpec. <br>
DURAS: You have no say in this, cha'DIch! <br>
PICARD: I speak now as the Captain of the USS Enterprise and Lieutenant
Worf's commanding officer. You will not execute
a member of my crew, nor will I turn his brother over to you. <br>
K'MPEC: This is not the Federation, Picard. If you defy an order of the
High Council, the alliance with the Federation could fall to dust. <br>
PICARD: The alliance with the Federation is not based on lies, K'mpec!
Protect your secrets if you must, but you will not sacrifice these men.
<br>
WORF: I will die for the Empire. <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant. <br>
WORF: The cha'DIch will be silent. Allow my brother to return to his
life. Only you need know his true bloodline. <br>
DURAS: Not acceptable. His honour would demand revenge. <br>
WORF: If you allow him to live, I will give you something that will
serve your purpose far more than my death. I will accept
discommendation. <br>
DURAS: You would do this in open council? <br>
K'MPEC: It would be the same as admitting your father's guilt, Worf. <br>
WORF: So be it. <br>
K'MPEC: Your heart is Klingon. It will be done. What has been said here
will never be spoken of again. <br>
WORF: You are the son of a traitor. <br>
(Worf slaps Duras' face) <br>
WORF: Now I am ready.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KURN: Why is he doing this? I was prepared to die. <br>
PICARD: Worf wants you to live. The name of your father must someday be
cleared. He needs you alive with your honour intact. <br>

PICARD: There will be another day, Commander. Do not forget what he
does here today. Do not let your children forget. <br>
