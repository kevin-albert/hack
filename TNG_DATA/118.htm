<br>
RIKER: On the way. <br>
BERNARD: Harry! Harry, come back here! <br>
(The running child bumps straight into Riker)<br>
RIKER: What's your hurry, Harry? <br>
HARRY: Sorry, Commander. I was just <br>
(His father arrives) <br>
BERNARD: Harry! I'm sorry if he bothered you. <br>
RIKER: No bother, Doctor Bernard. <br>
HARRY: I'm not going back. I hate that teacher and I hate calculus. <br>
BERNARD: Everyone needs an understanding of basic calculus, whether
they like it or not. <br>
HARRY: Why?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: You're limping. <br>
RIKER: Had a small run-in with an aspiring sprinter. <br>
PICARD: Number One. <br>
RIKER: Problem, Captain? <br>
PICARD: No, more a curiosity. For the past few hours we've been
tracking faint energy readings in an attempt to locate the source. It's
like following a trail of bread crumbs. The pathfinder lead here and
stopped, which is what I knew would interest you. <br>
RIKER: What's our position, Geordi? <br>
LAFORGE: The Epsilon Mynos system, sir. <br>
RIKER: Thank you, Captain, you're right. I wouldn't miss this for
anything. <br>
TASHA: What's so interesting about this system? <br>
RIKER: Aldea. Tasha, I'm surprised you haven't heard the stories about
Aldea, the
wondrous mythical world. Like Atlantis of ancient Earth or Neinman of
Xerxes Seven. Advanced culture, centuries old. Self-contained,
peaceful. Incredible technical sophistication providing the daily needs
for all the citizens, so that they could turn themselves over to art
and culture. <br>
TASHA: Where is it supposed to be? <br>
RIKER: That's the myth. Somehow, as the legend goes, the Aldeans were
able to cloak their planet in darkness and go unseen by marauders, and
other hostile passers-by who might rob and plunder. <br>
TASHA: What a wonderful fairy tale. <br>
DATA: Scanners still show nothing, sir. <br>
TROI: Scanners may show nothing, sir, but I'm sensing something very
strong. Thousands of minds. <br>
PICARD: From where? <br>
TROI: Very close. <br>
PICARD: All stop, and hold this position. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. All stop, and hold. <br>
PICARD: Anything? <br>
WORF: Captain, I'm recording a distortion in quadrant one, mark nine
zero. <br>
PICARD: On screen. <br>
(The stars wobble) <br>
PICARD: Shields and deflectors up. <br>
TASHA: Aye, sir. <br>

RIKER: It's Aldea, Captain. It has to be.

or intent, we've been led to the planet Aldea, which appeared out of

electromagnetic, a complicated light refracting mechanism. <br>
PICARD: A cloaking device? <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
LAFORGE: It's got to be pretty sophisticated to hide an entire planet .
<br>
WORF: We're being scanned, sir. <br>
PICARD: We'll let them know our peaceful intention. Open hailing
frequencies, Lieutenant Yar. <br>
TASHA: Frequencies open, sir. <br>
(A young woman comes on the viewscreen) <br>
RASHELLA [on viewscreen]: I am Rashella. Welcome to Aldea. <br>
PICARD: I am Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the USS Enterprise. We come in
peace. <br>
RASHELLA [on viewscreen]: We know. <br>
PICARD: We've heard the stories about Aldea, but frankly I never
believed they could be true. <br>
RASHELLA [on viewscreen]: Our shield has confused outsiders for
millennia, Captain. <br>
PICARD: That's a very long time to have such technology. Why do you
reveal yourselves to us now? <br>
RASHELLA [on viewscreen]: We're eager to meet in person to discuss
that, and other subjects of mutual interest. <br>
PICARD: We're ready anytime. <br>
RASHELLA [on viewscreen]: Excellent! <br>
(Rashella and a man appear on the deck, and seem dizzy at first) <br>
RADUE: We mean no harm. <br>
RASHELLA: Our arrival seems to have startled you. <br>
PICARD: It was a little sudden. <br>
RADUE: I'm Radue, First Appointee to Aldea. <br>
PICARD: Welcome aboard. <br>
CRUSHER: Captain, they haven't been through decontamination. <br>
PICARD: Our medical doctor is concerned that you didn't go through the
regular transporting procedure. <br>
RASHELLA: You couldn't transport us. The only way through our shield is
our way, Captain. Our cloaking device may be off, but our shield is
operating. We've brought you small tokens of welcome. <br>
(She hands over a bouquet) <br>
RADUE: And a personal invitation to a celebration on Aldea. <br>
PICARD: That would be delightful. Number One, assemble the away team. <br>
RADUE: We will prepare for your arrival, Commander Riker. <br>
RIKER: How do you know <br>
RADUE: Your name? We've been monitoring your ship's communications. We
must return now to Aldea. Our eyes are very sensitive to bright light.
Rashella. <br>
(They vanish again) <br>
PICARD: Amazing. To exist only in that dreamworld of mythology and then
suddenly to be here, right in front of us. <br>
RIKER: Now we know who placed the bread crumbs. We're not here by
accident. <br>
PICARD: Counsellor, do you sense anything? <br>
TROI: They want something from us, something we value greatly. So much,
that they're afraid we won't part with it. <br>
RADUE [OC]: We are ready to receive you, Commander Riker, and two of
your colleagues? <br>
(Riker, Troi and Crusher disappear) <br>
PICARD: Interesting choices.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WESLEY: How do they cloak the planet? <br>
DATA: The theory is simple. The shield bends light rays around the
planet's contour, similar to the Romulan cloaking device. But the
implementation is quite difficult. <br>
(A golden beam starts to sweep the Bridge) <br>
WORF: Captain! <br>
PICARD: Data, what do you read? <br>
DATA: Some sort of scanning device, sir. <br>
(It holds on Wesley) <br>
PICARD: Don't touch him! <br>
LAFORGE: This beam is emanating from Aldea. <br>
PICARD: Shields up. La Forge, contact Commander Riker. Worf, check all
decks. <br>
TASHA: Shields inoperable, sir. <br>
DATA: All decks being probed in a methodical pattern, sir. <br>
PICARD: All decks? Everything? The entire ship? <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
LAFORGE: I can't reach the Commander. We're being blocked. <br>
(The beam vanishes) <br>
PICARD: Wesley, are you all right? <br>
WESLEY: It was scary at first, but I really didn't feel anything. <br>
WORF: Sir, similar incidents all decks, but only with the children.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[First Unit]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RADUE: Yes, we are an ancient power, Commander, but
we've suffered for it. Our history is littered with the deaths of those
Aldeans who wanted more and more things. Nothing was ever enough. So
we've evolved a very simple way of living. For whatever is taken,
something is given in return. <br>
RIKER: It seems an equitable code. <br>
RADUE: It's brought us peace. Unfortunately, there are very few of us
left to enjoy it. <br>
TROI: Why? <br>
RADUE: That is part of what we wish to discuss. We need help from the
Federation to rebuild our heritage. We need a younger generation,
strong and healthy, following in the Aldean traditions. <br>
RIKER: I don't understand. How can the Federation help influence your
children in your traditions? <br>
RADUE: Because we have no children, Commander. Rashella was the last
child born on this planet. <br>
CRUSHER: And your medical community can do nothing? <br>
RASHELLA: They've tried, Doctor Crusher. And failed. <br>
CRUSHER: Perhaps we can help. <br>
RIKER: Radue, exactly why were we invited here? <br>
RADUE: We propose a trade. One which will solve our problem and give
something back to the Federation. <br>
RIKER: And the nature of this trade? <br>
RADUE: We need some of your children. In payment, we will give you
information that would take you centuries to acquire. <br>
TROI: That might be acceptable to some other races, but humans are
unusually attached to their offspring. <br>
CRUSHER: Our children are not for sale at any price. <br>
RIKER: We sympathise with your situation, but what you ask is not
possible. <br>
RADUE: And that's your final answer? <br>
RIKER: That's my only answer. Now if there's some other way we can help
you. <br>
RADUE: I am sorry you are intransigent. <br>

CRUSHER: Wesley! They've taken my son. <br>
(all over the ship, children are disappearing. Alexandra while playing
at her mother's feet, Katie while playing a musical instrument) <br>
WORF: Captain, Saucer Section reports six more children are gone. <br>
RIKER: It's the children. That's why we've been brought here. That's
what they wanted. <br>
PICARD: And that's what they have. Status. <br>
TASHA: Aldean shield still up. Hailing frequencies open. No response. <br>
PICARD: Keep trying. Counsellor, you'll have to gather the parents. <br>
TROI: They'll need to speak to you as well, Captain. <br>
RADUE [on viewscreen]: Captain, your children are with us. My word of
honour, no harm will ever come to them. <br>
PICARD: Harm has already come to them. <br>
RADUE [on viewscreen]: Captain, let us begin discussions regarding
appropriate compensation. <br>
PICARD: Compensation? You have stolen our children away from their
classrooms, away from their bedrooms and you talk about compensation?
You claim to be a civilised world and yet you have just committed an
act of utter barbarity! <br>
RADUE [on viewscreen]: Captain, we will continue these discussions when
you've calmed down. </font></p>

RADUE: Greetings, Wesley Crusher. The Custodian indicated that you

WESLEY: The Custodian? Who is the Custodian? <br>

the risks were when we signed on, and that's the choice we made. Now,
Captain Picard will do everything possible to bring our children back. <br>
PICARD: The Aldeans are anxious to discuss compensation. <br>
BERNARD: Compensation? <br>
PICARD: That will buy us time. I've asked Doctor Crusher to be involved
in the negotiations as your representative. <br>
BERNARD: Why were these specific children taken? <br>
TROI: We can't be sure. We do know the Aldeans can't have children of
their own. <br>
BERNARD: Then they won't let them go easily. <br>
PICARD: I won't insult you by pretending that any of this will be easy.
But I can tell you that the Enterprise will not leave them behind. You
can be assured of that. <br>
BERNARD: Can we talk with our children? Give them some reassurance. Let
them know that we are here, and that they will be safe. <br>
PICARD: I'll do my best to arrange that. <br>

live together. <br>
WESLEY: Do you mean like a family. <br>

(Katie and Melian leave) <br>
WESLEY: What about me? Don't I get a say in this? <br>
RADUE: Wesley, sometimes something happens which you just must accept.
You and the other children are now members of this society. That will
not change. It is up to you to make the transition as easy as possible
for the others. It's your duty, because you are their leader. Help them
to accept it because nothing you, or those on the starship can do will
change it. Because like you, we also have no choice. <br>

TASHA: Not yet, sir. <br>
RIKER: Captain, Data has found something interesting. The Aldean shield
gives evidence of random fluctuations, weakening its structure in
isolated sections. <br>
PICARD: You're saying there are holes in their defence system? <br>
RIKER: In essence, yes. I find it surprising after all these eons that
the Aldeans' have not perfected their technology. One would assume they
would be aware of the weakness and repair it. <br>
PICARD: Can we beam down an away team through one of those holes? <br>
RIKER: It's a possibility. It would have to be perfectly timed, and
there's no guarantee. <br>
DATA: We may be more successful in deciphering the code they use to
transport through the magnetic shield. <br>
PICARD: Can you do that? <br>
DATA: Eventually, sir. I am working on it now but the number of
permutations is almost endless. <br>
PICARD: Keep trying. While he's doing that, Number One, I want you and
La Forge to try and find some way of getting through one of those
holes, because one way or the other we have got to get an away team on
the planet, locate the power source for the shield and neutralise it. <br>
RIKER: You're certain they'll negotiate? <br>
PICARD: Oh, they'll negotiate, or they'll call it that. They've taken
what they want. Now they'll rationalise it by throwing us some sort of
bone. <br>
RIKER: And when we don't accept their offer? <br>
PICARD: The minute they believe that we won't accept their compensation
for the children, they'll break off the discussion, they'll disappear
behind their shield, locking us out and the children in forever. That's
why I've got to keep them talking.

have no reason to believe the rest of the Aldeans are any healthier.
They're suffering from some kind of chromosomal damage. It could be
genetic or environmental. <br>
PICARD: And is that why they can't conceive? <br>

and sensitivity to light. <br>
