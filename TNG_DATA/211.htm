lost contact with the research vessel Vico, which
was sent to explore the interior of a Black Cluster. We are en route to
investigate.

<br>
DATA: I am picking up massive gravitational fluctuations, sir. <br>
PICARD: Take us out of warp, Ensign. <br>
FELTON: Yes, sir. <br>
WORF: The Black Cluster is within visual range, Captain. <br>
PICARD: On screen. <br>
WORF: Aye, Captain. <br>
(it looks like any other streak of black against a star cluster) <br>
RIKER: Let's find that ship. Full sensor sweep, Mister Data. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
RIKER: What a sight. <br>
PICARD: One of the most ancient formations in the galaxy. <br>
DATA: I have located the Vico, sir. The vessel appears to be adrift. <br>
RIKER: Let's see it. Life signs? <br>
WORF: Nothing, Commander. <br>
RIKER: Damage report, Mister Data. <br>
DATA: Outer and inner hulls have been breached. Decks seven through
twelve are exposed to space. <br>
RIKER: Set up a translink to their computer core. Let's see what
happened. <br>
DATA: I cannot, sir. The emergency bulkheads on that deck are in place.
Our linkup signal cannot penetrate them. <br>
PICARD: Structural status, Commander? <br>
DATA: Stress readings indicate considerable pressure on the transverse
supports. <br>
PICARD: Is it stable enough for an away team? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir, but the risk of structural collapse is quite high. <br>
PICARD: Have transporter room one maintain a lock on each member of
your away team. I want you out of there at the first sign of trouble. <br>
RIKER: Take us to fifteen thousand metres, Ensign. <br>
FELTON: Yes, sir. <br>
RIKER: Data, you're with me.

from. They had a big ship and they kept shooting at us. Then they
beamed over. They had purple helmets on and phaser rifles. I saw them.
They didn't see me. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: This is not good. Whatever hit the Vico
must have set up an EM pulse that flashed through their computer banks.
<br>
DATA: Nearly eighty three percent of their records have been lost. <br>
LAFORGE: And all of their sensor logs. Let's use what we got from our
own sensors. I'll call up the structural analysis and the surface
scans. <br>
DATA: Geordi, as a child, did you ever experience a traumatic event? <br>
LAFORGE: You're wondering about Timothy? <br>
DATA: Yes. <br>
LAFORGE: I was caught in a fire once. I must have been, I don't know,
about five, I guess. It was before I got the first visor. And it was
only a couple of minutes before my parents found me and pulled me out.
And nobody got hurt, but I tell you that was the longest couple of
minutes of my life. It was a while after that before I could even let
my parents get out of earshot. It was like I absolutely needed to know
that they were there, you know? <br>
DATA: Timothy no longer has that kind of support. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(the male teacher is reading aloud to the quiet and
attentive pupils, who are following on their PADDS, except one) <br>
TEACHER: Dara and her brother found themselves in the land of Tagas
where the ruler, Elamos the Magnificent, had proclaimed as law. 'No
children will be tolerated within the Great Kingdom'. When Dara saw the
proclamation, she just laughed, and said, 'How magnificent a ruler, to
be frightened by the likes of us.' Timothy, we're done with sculpture
for now. <br>
TIMOTHY: It's not finished. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(at the science station) <br>
LAFORGE: Magnetic residual analysis confirms that the Vico was attacked
inside the Black Cluster. The graviton wave fronts pushed the ship to
where we found it. <br>
PICARD: No signs of phaser burns on the hull. <br>
LAFORGE: No, sir. Torsional stress levels point to a disrupter-style
weapon. <br>
DATA: Fracture points indicate that the energy burst came from a range
of less than three thousand metres. <br>
PICARD: But that's a strategy consistent with a cloaked vessel.
Romulan. Or Klingon. But we're quite a distance from either of their
territories. <br>
DATA: The Breen have outposts in this sector. The attack on the Vico is
consistent with their battle tactics and their level of technology. <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Data. But what would the Breen be doing inside the
Black Cluster? The boy described a boarding party with helmets and
phaser rifles. <br>
LAFORGE: Boarding party? I don't think that's likely, sir. <br>
(Troi enters) <br>
PICARD: Counsellor. <br>
LAFORGE: There was absolutely no evidence of anybody coming on board
the Vico. We would have found a transporter field trace. Or if somebody
had used the entry ports, we would have found an electrostatic
differential in the docking latches, and we didn't. Could Timothy have
imagined that, Counsellor? <br>
PICARD: Or could he be lying? <br>
TROI: If he's lying, I haven't been able to sense it. Perhaps his
emotional trauma level is too high. <br>
PICARD: Why wouldn't he tell us the truth? <br>
TROI: He's still in shock. it's hard to know what's going on in his
mind right now. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, I'll go back and check the sensor readings again but I
don't think we're going to find anything. <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Geordi. <br>
(La Forge leaves) <br>
TROI: Data. Captain, I think we should ask Data to spend some time with
him. <br>
DATA: I do not understand. <br>
TROI: I'm very worried about his behaviour and what I've just heard
doesn't make me feel any better. Data, you're the only
one he's reached out to, because you rescued him. We can use your
relationship with him to help his recovery. <br>
PICARD: Would Timothy also be more inclined to tell Data the truth
about what happened? <br>
TROI: It's a possibility. <br>
PICARD: Commander, proceed with Timothy as the Counsellor suggests. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
(Picard leaves) <br>
DATA: Counsellor, exactly how shall I proceed? <br>

needs most right now. </font></p>

us about. That's where everybody came in. That's where they stood. And
that's where the altar was. What do you think? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: The Black Cluster was formed almost nine
billion years ago when hundreds of protostars collapsed in close
proximity. The resulting gravitational forces are both violent and
highly unpredictable. <br>
LAFORGE: To get anywhere near the centre, we're going to have to push
through the gravitational wavefronts like the science vessel was
designed to do. I've already adjusted our shields accordingly. <br>
WORF: The gravitational forces will affect sensor accuracy. Detecting
an enemy vessel will be difficult. <br>
RIKER: Maybe that's what happened to the Vico. They didn't see anything
coming until it was too late. <br>
PICARD: Counsellor, has the boy volunteered any further information? <br>
TROI: No, but I do have an appointment with him in less than half an
hour. <br>

it's called enantiodromia. Conversion into
the opposite. Timothy went from human to machine, from being emotional
to being emotionless. But the underlying trauma is still there. He's
just found a new way to suppress it. <br>
PICARD: Counsellor, how long will this behaviour last? <br>
TROI: As long as he needs it to. Timothy is rebuilding his identity as
best he can. The android persona is just one step along the way. As
soon as he feels stronger and more sure of himself, it should drop away
naturally. <br>

RIKER: Captain, the Black Cluster is distorting the sensors. We're
picking up echoes of the Enterprise reflecting off the wavefronts. <br>
PICARD: Cancel Red alert. Mister Worf, adjust the sensors to compensate
for the distortion. <br>
WORF: Aye. <br>
PICARD: Sensor difficulties have been reported by ships travelling
through black clusters, but never this extreme. <br>
WORF: Captain, that formation is seven times more massive than any
explored previously. That could explain the difference. <br>
PICARD: Resume previous course, Ensign. <br>
FELTON: Yes, sir.

TROI: Yes. It's nice to see, isn't it? <br>
DATA: It is certainly not consistent with his android persona. <br>
TROI: I'd say he's beginning the process of letting go of that fantasy.
<br>
DATA: Then my work with him is done. <br>
TROI: No, I don't think it is, Data. A laugh is one step in the right
direction. We need to help him take a few more steps. <br>
DATA: How, Counsellor? <br>
TROI: I'd like you to talk to him about your own fascination with
humanity. If you can explain to Timothy the appeal that humanity has
for you, he might find it easier to become a boy again.

TIMOTHY: This is great. How is yours? <br>
DATA: The complex polysaccharides, in reaction with the carbon dioxide,
produces an unusual combination of texture and
effervescence. <br>
TIMOTHY: But how does it taste? Is it good? <br>
DATA: I am not capable of tasting in the manner you suggest. However, I
can analyse the composition of a dessert and make comparative
conclusions about its possible effect on the human palate. But I
neither like it nor dislike it. <br>
TIMOTHY: Oh. I didn't realise that. <br>
DATA: I have often wondered what it must be like to have one's mouth
water in anticipation of the arrival of a confection, or to feel the
pleasure I have observed in humans as they consume it. <br>
TIMOTHY: You sound like you don't want to be an android. <br>
DATA: I am an android. That will never change. <br>
TIMOTHY: But if you could change, would you? <br>
DATA: I have often wished to be human. I study people carefully in
order to more closely approximate human behaviour. <br>
TIMOTHY: Why? We're stronger and smarter than humans. We can do more
than they can. <br>
DATA: But I cannot take pride in my abilities. I cannot take pleasure
in my accomplishments. <br>
TIMOTHY: But we never have to feel bad, either. <br>
DATA: I would gladly risk feeling bad at times if it also meant that I
could also taste my dessert.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: Captain, gravitational wavefront intensity is
increasing steadily. Eleven hundred standard G units and rising. <br>
PICARD: Let's see if anyone's out there. Mister Worf, attempt a wide
range sensor sweep. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. Gravitational distortion is too great, Captain. The
scanning signal is again being reflected off the wavefronts. I am
unable to compensate. The sensors are useless. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data to the Bridge, please. <br>
DATA [OC]: Acknowledged. <br>
PICARD: Adjust sensors to short range. Attempt a limited positron scan.
<br>
WORF: The distortion is still in effect. <br>
RIKER: Better jacket the scanning beam. <br>
WORF: The secondary beam is being distorted as well. <br>
(Data enters) <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, our sensors have been rendered ineffective by the
field distortion. I want your analysis. Mister Worf, fire phasers,
maximum intensity, limited spectrum. Zero zero one mark zero four five.
<br>
RIKER: An experiment, Captain? <br>
PICARD: Exactly, Number One. <br>
WORF: Firing phasers. <br>
(the single shot branches off in several directions) <br>
PICARD: Explanation, Mister Data. <br>
DATA: Phaser energy was reflected by the gravitational wavefronts. It
is similar to the phenomenon distorting our sensor signals. <br>
PICARD: Phasers and sensors both useless? Mister Data, this reflection
phenomenon, would it have the same effect on a disruptor-style weapon? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. Disruptors would be ineffectual. <br>
PICARD: And a ship's cloaking field? <br>
DATA: It would be extremely difficult to maintain. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, is it at all likely that the Vico could have been
attacked inside the cluster? <br>

exceedingly remote, sir. <br>

I didn't mean to do it. <br>
PICARD: What was it that didn't you mean to do, Timothy? <br>
TIMOTHY: My arm hit the computer panel. That's what destroyed the ship.
<br>
TROI: The ship was damaged when your arm hit the computer panel?
Timothy, listen to me. The damage to your ship might have occurred at
the same time your arm touched the panel, but it was only a
coincidence. This wasn't your fault. <br>
TIMOTHY: Yes it was. <br>
DATA: It is not possible. The onboard control systems for every
starship require a user code clearance. You could not have
inadvertently affected any of the Vico's systems. <br>
PICARD: Your computer had safety precautions. There is nothing you
could have touched that would have damaged your ship. <br>
TROI: You're not responsible for what happened to your parents,
Timothy. <br>

DATA: Our own shields caused the increases in the wavefronts, sir. We
have been experiencing a harmonic amplification effect. <br>
RIKER: The more energy we dumped into the shield grid, the worse the
impact. <br>
DATA: Precisely. That is also what destroyed the Vico. When Timothy
remembered similar procedures on his ship, I initiated an analysis of
shield output to wavefront amplitude and discovered a correlation. <br>

would have torn the ship apart. <br>
