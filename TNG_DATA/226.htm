Captain's log, stardate 45959.1. The Enterprise has been recalled to
sector zero zero one on a priority mission. All we've been told is that
evidence has been discovered indicating the presence of
extraterrestrials on Earth five centuries ago. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Cavern]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SCIENTIST: Work crews were down here installing
seismic regulators when they found some remarkable artefacts. <br>
PICARD: And it's been determined that they date back to the late
nineteenth century? <br>
SCIENTIST: Yes. <br>
(he takes a sheet off a packing case to reveal the items) <br>
DATA: The bifocal vision aid is typical of the era. The weapon is a
forty five calibre double-action cavalry pistol invented by Colt
Firearms in 1873. <br>
SCIENTIST: Here, look inside the watch. <br>
(an engraving - To S.L.C., with love. 30 November, 1889). <br>
PICARD: What makes you think that extraterrestrials are related to
these discoveries. <br>
SCIENTIST: The crew was having a problem with the regulators. Something
inside the cavern was interfering with the phase conditioners. It
turned out to be the cavern itself. <br>
(Data gets out his tricorder) <br>
DATA: The composition of the exposed rock face has been altered by
exposure to triolic waves. <br>
SCIENTIST: Which you're not going to find on Earth in either the
nineteenth or twenty fourth century. <br>
PICARD: Triolic waves? <br>
DATA: The by-product of an energy source employed by very few species
because of its deleterious effect on living tissue. <br>
SCIENTIST: We've confirmed that no one has been in or out of this
cavern in centuries, so we're left with a five hundred year old
mystery. <br>
PICARD: I'm curious, Doctor. There are far greater experts on Earth to
investigate your mystery. Why bring the Enterprise all the way home? <br>
SCIENTIST: As we continued our excavation, we found one other thing I
haven't shown you yet. We've tried to leave everything as we found it. <br>
(and he uncovers - Data's head)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 45960.2. We have
transported the materials discovered in the cavern back to the ship for
analysis. I wish I could be as dispassionate about the implications as
my second officer.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Interesting. There is a twelve percent
decomposition of the bitanium in the neural pathway links. That
suggests the alloys are vulnerable to <br>
RIKER: Data, how can you look inside that, analyse the decomposition
without <br>
DATA: Emotion, sir? <br>
RIKER: Yes.. <br>
DATA: I am simply trying to make an objective assessment. <br>
PICARD: Data, is this yours? <br>
DATA: I believe so, sir. <br>
PICARD: Could it be Lore? <br>
DATA: No, sir. My brother's positronic brain has a type L phase
discriminating amplifier. Mine is a type R. <br>
PICARD: Type R? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: Can you predict how long this has been in the cavern? <br>
DATA: Decomposition strongly indicates that life was terminated
approximately five hundred years ago. That would be consistent with the
other artefacts we recovered. <br>
RIKER: Your head is not an artefact. <br>
DATA: In relative terms, perhaps not. Nevertheless, it seems clear that
my life is to end in the late nineteenth century. <br>
RIKER: Not if we can help it. <br>
DATA: There is no way anyone can prevent it, sir. At some future date,
I will be transported back to nineteenth century Earth, where I will
die. It has occurred. It will occur. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, I can't tell you exactly who the aliens were, but I have
found out a few things. The triolicised rock face tells
us we're probably dealing with a species with microcentrum cell
membranes. Triolic waves wouldn't harm them. It also might mean they're
shape shifters of some kind. <br>
RIKER: So they could have appeared on Earth as humans. <br>
LAFORGE: I don't think it's anyone we've run into before. Nothing we
found matches up with any known lifeforms. What does match up is a
cellular fossil which might have been along just for the ride. <br>
PICARD: A cellular fossil? <br>
LAFORGE: A microscopic ciliated lifeform. Not unlike a thousand other
single-celled lifeforms you'd find on any planet surface, except this
particular one is LB one zero four four five. And LB one zero four four
five is only known to exist on one place. Devidia Two, in the Marrab
sector. <br>
PICARD: Number One, lay in a course. <br>
RIKER: On my way.

DATA: Are you referring to the foreknowledge of my death? <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah. <br>
DATA: I have no particular desire to discuss the matter. Do you need to
talk about it? <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah. <br>
DATA: Why? <br>
LAFORGE: Data, this has got to bother you a little. <br>
DATA: On the contrary. I find it rather comforting. <br>
LAFORGE: Comforting? <br>
DATA: I have often wondered about my own mortality as I have seen
others around me age. Until now it has been theoretically possible that
I would live an unlimited period of time. And although some might find
this attractive, to me it only reinforces the fact that I am
artificial. <br>
LAFORGE: I never knew how tough this must be for you. <br>
DATA: Tough? As in difficult? <br>
LAFORGE: Knowing that you would outlive all your friends. <br>
DATA: I expected to make new friends. <br>
LAFORGE: True. <br>
DATA: And then to outlive them as well. <br>
LAFORGE: Now that you know that you might not? <br>
DATA: It provides a sense of completion to my future. In a way, I am
not that different from anyone else. I can now look forward to death. <br>
LAFORGE: I never thought of it that way. <br>
DATA: One might also conclude that it brings me one step closer to
being human. I am mortal. <br>
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Bridge officers. We're approaching the Devidia
system. Report to your stations. <br>
LAFORGE: I'll see you later. Let's get together for a game of chess or
something, okay? <br>
(Data leaves) <br>
GUINAN: That sounded like a very intense discussion. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah. They found Data's head a mile beneath San Francisco.
Been down there about five centuries. <br>
GUINAN: That's why the Enterprise has been sent back to Earth. I didn't
realise. <br>
LAFORGE: It's something, isn't it? He seems fine about it. Better than
I am. Well, I'd better get to Engineering. <br>

TROI: If you don't want to talk about it, it's okay. <br>
RIKER: I'm fine. I'm just <br>
TROI: Angry. <br>
RIKER: I'm not angry. Yeah, I'm angry. Why should I be angry? <br>
TROI: Maybe because it reminds us of our own mortality. <br>
RIKER: I just don't want to believe it. <br>
TROI: Have you ever heard Data define friendship? <br>
RIKER: No. <br>
TROI: How did he put it? As I experience certain sensory input
patterns, my mental pathways become accustomed to them. The inputs
eventually are anticipated and even missed when absent. <br>
RIKER: So what's the point? <br>
TROI: He's used to us, and we're used to him. It's like finding out

inquiry? <br>
TROI: Personal inquiry? No, go right ahead. <br>
DATA: I am perceiving an apparent change in the way others behave
toward me. For example, people abruptly end conversations when I
appear, just as you did when the turbolift doors opened. Is that an
accurate observation? <br>
RIKER: Not at all. <br>
TROI: (same time) Yes. <br>
RIKER: Yes. <br>
TROI: You're right, Data. And it's not a very nice thing to do. <br>

PICARD: Any sign of life? <br>
WORF: Negative, sir. <br>
DATA: Captain, sensors are picking up an unusual temporal disturbance
on a small area of the planet's surface. Forty two degrees seven
minutes north by eighty eight degrees declination east. <br>
RIKER: Temporal disturbance? <br>
PICARD: Put us in a standard orbit above those coordinates. <br>
DATA: Spectral analysis shows a high level of triolic waves emanating
from the same location. <br>
RIKER: Any correlation with the readings from Earth? <br>
DATA: Affirmative, sir. The magnetic signature is identical to the one
found in the cavern. <br>
PICARD: Would these triolic waves be dangerous to humanoids? <br>
DATA: Only with long term exposure, sir. There is no immediate threat. <br>

PICARD: Then I'll be irrational. <br>
DATA: It is possible, sir, that the events leading to my death will not
occur for years, even centuries. <br>
PICARD: I hope that's true, Mister Data. Nevertheless, this
investigation began with your death. I am simply trying to see that it
doesn't end that way. <br>

one cannot cheat fate. <br>

there is currently a cholera epidemic in San Francisco. <br>
BELLBOY: Never felt better. <br>
DATA: Of course. The gratuity. Thank you for your assistance. <br>
BELLBOY: A dollar? If there's anything you need. It can get lonely in
San Francisco. You might want some company. I can introduce you to
Lillian. <br>
DATA: I have no need for companionship. However I do require some
supplies. <br>
BELLBOY: Anything you need. I can get it for you wholesale. I can get
it for you less than wholesale if you don't ask me where it came from. <br>
(Data has been writing a list) <br>
BELLBOY: What do you need all this stuff for? <br>
DATA: I am an inventor. <br>
BELLBOY: No kidding. Well, this stuff's going to take a while. I'll
have to go clear cross town. And it's not
going to be cheap. <br>
(Data takes a wad of notes from his waistcoat pocket) <br>

PICARD: We cannot make Mister Data our priority. <br>
RIKER: What is more important than Data? <br>
TROI: Look at what we have so far. Evidence that these aliens have been
travelling back in time to Earth. <br>
CRUSHER: What if they're trying to undermine our history for some
reason. <br>
WORF: Some kind of guerilla war? <br>
PICARD: We must assume that there is a threat, if not to us then to
19th century Earth. We have to determine what that threat may be.
Mister La Forge, we have to find some way to communicate with these
life forms. <br>
LAFORGE: It's not going to be easy to reproduce what Data did. We can
create a contained subspace field, but we'd need an extraordinarily
sensitive phase discriminator to get that point zero zero four
variance. <br>
PICARD: Can you build one? <br>
LAFORGE: It won't be as good as Data's. <br>
RIKER: Will it be good enough? <br>
LAFORGE: I don't know. I can try. It's going to take some time though. <br>
PICARD: I don't want anyone else going in alone. <br>
LAFORGE: I can probably create a large enough subspace field to
encompass everyone. But adjusting the phase inside the field, that's
going to be the hard part. <br>
PICARD: Make it so. <br>
RIKER: We have to assume one thing, sir. Wherever Data may be, he's
doing the same thing we are, which is trying to get to the bottom of
this. He may have a better idea about what's going on than we do, so it
might be in the best interests of this mission to find him. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps in the course of this investigation, we will. I hope
so. <br>
WORF: If we find Commander Data, it may be our fate to die with him in
the past. If our remains are in that cavern, they would have turned to
dust long ago.

GUINAN: Captain, you didn't have to come all the way down here. I
would've been more than happy to come up to you. <br>
PICARD: And miss all this? I haven't seen such a complex operation
since the Academy lab final in exochemistry. <br>
GUINAN: It's a Tzartak aperitif. It's very, very touchy. The trick is
to change the evaporation point of the main ingredient. You want the
temperature where the liquid goes to vapour to be a half a degree below
the body temperature of the customer.
That way, when the liquid touches the tongue, it evaporates, and the
flavour is carried entirely by the vapour. A few molecules off, the
vapour point crashes, and poof! It's all gone. All of it. <br>
PICARD: What is it you wanted to see me about? <br>
GUINAN: I hear you're sending an away team down to the surface. Are you

an away mission. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CLEMENS: The eminent scientist Alfred Russell
Wallace has revived the theory that Earth is at the centre of the
stellar universe. This distinguished natural philosopher has reaffirmed
our planet as the only habitable globe in the heavens. A world,
furthermore, constructed for the sole benefit of man. He's got a lot of
folks excited about the notion. <br>
GUINAN: My dear Mister Clemens, why do I think you're not one of them? <br>
CLEMENS: Your suspicions, Madam Guinan, are undoubtedly based upon your
keen observational skills. Now, if you'll permit me, I'll continue my
character assassination unimpeded. <br>
GUINAN: My dear Mister Clemens, please do. Please do. <br>
CLEMENS: According to our best geologic estimate, the Earth is
approximately one hundred million years of age. Perhaps it is less,
perhaps more. <br>
GUINAN: Perhaps a great deal more. <br>
CLEMENS: Indeed. But regardless, it is ancient in the extreme. Now,
geology also tells us that man himself has existed for but a
microscopic fraction of those years. Curious, isn't it, that the world
got by for such a great long while with no humans around to fill up
space? I suppose Mister Wallace and his supporters would say that the
Earth needed all that time to prepare itself for our illustrious
arrival. Why, the oyster alone probably required fifteen million years
to get it to come out just right. <br>
GUINAN: But if the Earth is not alone, and there are millions of
inhabited planets in the heavens. <br>
CLEMENS: Quite my point. Man becomes a trivial creation, does he not?
Lost in the vastness of the cosmic prairie, adrift on the deep ocean of
time. A single one among countless others. <br>
GUINAN: Someone may argue that a diamond is still a diamond, even if it
is one amongst millions. It still shines as brightly. <br>
CLEMENS: Someone might say that, dear lady, if someone thought that the
human race was akin to a precious jewel. But this increasingly
hypothetical someone would not be me. </font></p>
