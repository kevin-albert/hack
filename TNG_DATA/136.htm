DATA: What puzzles me, Captain, is how she is expected to bring peace
to Daled Four. Its inhabitants have been fighting throughout their
recorded history. <br>
PICARD: What do we know about the cause of these wars? <br>
DATA: Only that it is the difference between night and day. <br>
RIKER: Data, you used a colloquialism. <br>
DATA: Did I? What I meant, sir, is that Daled Four rotates only once
per revolution. Therefore one side is constantly dark, and the other
side constantly light. One might surmise that the two hemispheres have
developed disparate cultures, which is a major cause of most wars. <br>
PICARD: This child is supposed to bring them together. <br>

incident. <br>
TROI: Whatever kind of life form Anya is, emotionally she's Salia's
mother. <br>
PICARD: The most dangerous animal is a mother protecting her young. <br>
TROI: Exactly. <br>
ANYA [OC]: Captain, this is Anya. <br>
PICARD: Yes? <br>
ANYA [OC]: Salia is gone. Where is she?

sure it's real. <br>
WESLEY: Believe me, Ten Forward isn't an illusion. <br>
SALIA: Not that. I mean the way I feel. <br>
GUINAN: You won't find a better dish of chocolate anywhere. <br>
SALIA: I'm sure I won't. <br>
WESLEY: Is something wrong? <br>
SALIA: I've had a great time being with you, Wesley. <br>
WESLEY: And that makes you sad? <br>
SALIA: When I was on Klavdia Three, all I could think of was leaving
that isolation. What makes me sad is having to face it again after
seeing what else is possible. <br>
WESLEY: Is that what awaits you on Daled Four? Isolation? <br>
SALIA: Yes. <br>
WESLEY: I thought you were going there to reunite two warring parties. <br>
SALIA: What else do you know? <br>
WESLEY: Very little. The ship's computer doesn't have that much on
Daled Four. How will you stop the fighting? <br>
SALIA: I'm not certain. I only know I will have many responsibilities
when I get there. Your language has no word for the position
I'll hold. In many ways I'll have even less freedom than I did on
Klavdia Three. <br>
WESLEY: You could stay. <br>
SALIA: On the Enterprise? <br>
WESLEY: Why not? <br>
SALIA: Because I can't. <br>

GUINAN: Just because a girl runs out, doesn't mean she doesn't wish you
to follow.

anything, but I can't have it! <br>
