WORF: Enter. Enter. <br>
RIKER: Worf, they're going to be here any minute. <br>
WORF: I am having problems. <br>
RIKER: If I didn't know you better, I'd say that you were
procrastinating. <br>
WORF: Klingons do not procrastinate. It is a tactical delay. <br>
RIKER: You have spend about five minutes greeting the Iyaarans maybe an
hour making small talk at this reception. I'm the one who has to escort
them around the ship for the next three days. <br>
WORF: I do not enjoy these diplomatic situations. <br>
RIKER: It's all part of being in Starfleet. There. <br>
WORF: I do not see why it is necessary to wear these ridiculous
uniforms. <br>
RIKER: Protocol. <br>
WORF: They look like dresses. <br>
RIKER: That is an incredibly outmoded and sexist attitude. I'm
surprised at you. Besides, you look good in a dress.

PICARD: Ah, you're just in time. They're about to disembark. <br>
(three males in very plain jumpsuits get out of the shuttle) <br>
PICARD: Ambassador Loquel, Ambassador Byleth. I'm Captain Picard.
Welcome on board the Enterprise. <br>
LOQUEL: It is our pleasure to be here, Captain. <br>
PICARD: It is an honour to be the site of the first cultural exchange
between the Iyaaran people and the Federation. <br>
BYLETH: (the tall one) The next seven days should prove most
illuminating. <br>
LOQUEL: Allow me to introduce Voval. He will be taking you back to our
homeworld. <br>
PICARD: How do you do. I'm looking forward very much to meeting with
the Premier of Iyar. There will be a reception held in your honour when
you will meet the rest of my senior staff. I, of course, shall be on my
way to your home world, but I shall be leaving you in the safe hands of
my most experienced officers. Lieutenant Worf, of the Klingon Empire,
is my head of Security. He will be in charge of your safety while
you're on board. Counsellor Deanna Troi of the planet Betazed will be
your personal liaison office, Ambassador Loquel. <br>
TROI: Ambassador, it's an honour to meet you. Would you like to see
your quarters before we attend the reception? <br>
LOQUEL: Please. <br>
(Troi and Loquel leave) <br>
PICARD: Ambassador Byleth, this is Commander William Riker, my First
Office, from the planet Earth. He has been assigned to you. <br>
BYLETH: (walks up to Worf) I want this one. <br>
PICARD: Well, Commander Riker is a skilled diplomat, with wide
experience in inter-species contact. <br>
BYLETH: I'm sure, I'm sure. But I have decided. I want this Lieutenant
Worf. <br>
PICARD: Well, that will be just fine. Mister Worf? <br>
WORF: Yes. Yes Ambassador, it would be my pleasure to <br>
BYLETH: Yes, yes. Enough of that. Show me to my quarters. <br>
WORF: This way. <br>

(to woman) Good evening. <br>
WOMAN: Good evening. <br>
(at the buffet table) <br>
TROI: So first thing tomorrow, I thought I'd take you on a tour of the
operational centres and the residential decks of the ship. Then we
could spend some time discussing the cultural underpinnings of your
society. <br>
LOQUEL: Are you going to eat? <br>
TROI: Excuse me? <br>
LOQUEL: You have no food on your plate. Are you going to eat? <br>
TROI: Oh, well, actually, I was waiting until we got to the desserts. <br>
LOQUEL: Desserts? What is this? <br>
TROI: It's something we eat after the main course. It's usually very
sweet, it's usually very bad for you. We eat it purely for pleasure. If
you ask me, it's the best part of any meal. <br>
LOQUEL: My people eat only for nourishment. <br>
TROI: Oh, well, let me introduce you to some of my favourites. This is
peach cobbler with whipped cream. Tarvokian powder cake. And this is my
favourite. Ktarian chocolate puff. I don't know exactly what's inside,
but I think it's made with seventeen varieties of chocolate. <br>
(Troi gives Loquel a sample) <br>
LOQUEL: That is, that is <br>
TROI: Delicious? <br>
LOQUEL: Delicious. <br>
TROI: Ambassador, I think we're going to get along very well. Shall we?
<br>
(Loquel takes his loaded plate and a tray of small desserts with him to
a table) <br>
(meanwhile, at another table, Worf and Crusher eat with Byleth) <br>
BYLETH: This is unacceptable. <br>
WORF: I am sorry you do not care for our <br>
BYLETH: Bring me new food. I require a higher protein and enzymatic
content. <br>
CRUSHER: Ambassador <br>
BYLETH: Yes. <br>
CRUSHER: It's the custom usually in a situation like this, for us to
serve ourselves. It's called a buffet, and <br>
BYLETH: Bring me new food. <br>
CRUSHER: Ambassador <br>
WORF: Doctor, it is all right. I am happy to bring more food. <br>
(Worf slices a meat joint as if he wishes it were Byleth) <br>
DATA: How is your diplomatic assignment progressing? <br>
WORF: Fine. <br>
DATA: I have heard that in moments of diplomatic tension, it is often
helpful to find elements of commonality. <br>
WORF: Ambassador Byleth is demanding, temperamental and rude. <br>
DATA: You share all of those qualities in abundance. Perhaps you should
try to build on your similarities. <br>

some of the most spectacular crystal formations in this sector. Is
there any place in particular that you would recommend I visit while
I'm there? <br>
VOVAL: No. <br>
PICARD: Well, I, er, what's our ETA? <br>
VOVAL: Seventeen hours, thirty two minutes. <br>
PICARD: I think I'll go update my itinerary. <br>
(a jolt, an alarm goes off ) <br>
PICARD: What happened? <br>
VOVAL: There's been a system-wide power failure. <br>
PICARD: What's the cause? <br>
VOVAL: We have entered an energy disruption field. I do not recognise
the configuration. Attitude controls failing. <br>
PICARD: There is an M-class planet in this system. Can we reach it? <br>
VOVAL: I will try. <br>
PICARD: Inertial dampeners are offline. Life support is failing. <br>
VOVAL: Entering the planet's atmosphere. <br>
PICARD: Velocity dropping. Thermal shields at full power. <br>
VOVAL: Prepare for impact. <br>
(they crash on a rocky planet with a penchant for horizontal lightning
and are knocked out. Picard wakes first.) <br>
PICARD: Voval. Voval, try not to move. You may have a concussion.
Picard to Enterprise. Picard to Enterprise, do you read me? Too much
interference. <br>
(Picard gets a tricorder from his overnight bag) <br>
PICARD: There is a structure of some kind. Some energy readings about
two kilometres south of here. Voval, I'm going to try to find help. Do
you understand? Now, try to stay conscious and don't leave the shuttle.
There's some kind of plasma energy out on the surface. I'll be back as
soon as I can.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: The Engineering sections encompass twelve
decks of the secondary hull. Deck forty two contains the antimatter
storage facility. <br>
BYLETH: What is the mass flow rate of the antimatter replenishment
stream to the containment pods? <br>
WORF: Excuse me? <br>
BYLETH: The antimatter replenishment rate. What is it? <br>
WORF: I am not certain of the exact rate. <br>
BYLETH: Perhaps there is someone here who does know the answer. You.
Are you smarter than this one? <br>
LAFORGE: Why do you ask? <br>
BYLETH: Never mind. <br>
BYLETH: I wish to see the Bussard collectors. Take me to them. <br>

cartography, biological research, and astrophysics. We have over a
thousand people on board <br>
LOQUEL: Are you sure you don't want some of this, this papalla juice? <br>
TROI: No, thank you. I'm still recovering from all those desserts last
night. <br>
LOQUEL: Are you sure? It is very delicious. <br>
TROI: I'm sure. <br>
LOQUEL: Please, please. You've been so kind. Please. <br>
(Troi takes the smallest possible sip) <br>
TROI: Yum. Next we're going to go to deck eight, which is interesting
because it's not really finished. It's sort of a multi-purpose deck.
Sometimes when we need an extra lab or. Ambassador? <br>
(Troi discovers Loquel is not with her, and goes back to find him
examining a young boy) <br>
LOQUEL: What is this? <br>
TROI: It's a child. <br>
LOQUEL: Child? <br>
TROI: Children are our offspring. They're our young. They grow into
adults over a period of many years. They grow into beings like us. <br>
LOQUEL: Offspring. <br>
TROI: Ambassador, I'm curious. Now does your species procreate? <br>
LOQUEL: Post-cellular compounding. We emerge from the natal pod fully
grown. <br>
TROI: I see. <br>
LOQUEL: Do you have a name? <br>
BOY: Eric <br>
LOQUEL: Eric. Do you like dessert? <br>

fire. There is a device on his abdomen and he is in pain) <br>

(there is a woman on the other side of the fire. She comes over.) <br>
PICARD: What do you want? Who are you? Who are you? <br>
ANNA: Shh. <br>
PICARD: No, wait. Stop. There was someone else in the shuttlecraft with
me. The pilot, he's injured. He needs your help. <br>
ANNA: He's dead. <br>
(Anna leaves) <br>
(later, Anna has returned and is sitting by the fire. She is wearing a
pendant with a similar design to a device Voval was wearing) <br>
PICARD: Hello. (sees a bowl by his elbow) Smells good. Thank you. This
is a Terellian cargo freighter, isn't it? Is this your ship? Are you
one of the crew? <br>
ANNA: No. I was a passenger. We crashed. <br>
PICARD: How many people survived? Were you the only one? Well, you're
certainly not a Terellian, unless you've lost two of your arms. What's
your name? I'm Jean-Luc Picard. I'm a Starfleet officer. <br>
ANNA: Anna. <br>
PICARD: Anna, are there other people on this planet? How long have you
been here? <br>
ANNA: I don't know. You can't see the sun from here. I've lost track of
all time. <br>
PICARD: What was the date when you crashed? <br>
ANNA: Stardate 40812. <br>
PICARD: Seven years! <br>
ANNA: Years? <br>
PICARD: Anna, Anna. wait a minute. <br>
ANNA: Seven years? I thought one, maybe two. How could it be seven? <br>
PICARD: Anna, Anna, listen to me. Listen. On the shuttle, there is a
lot of equipment that will have survived the crash. We can use it to
contact Starfleet. They'll send a ship for us. We can leave. <br>
ANNA: Leave? <br>
PICARD: Yes. Both of us. Now, if you will help me to get to the
shuttle. Ow.<br>
ANNA: Don't move. it's bad. <br>
PICARD: Don't worry, I won't move. <br>
ANNA: You have three broken ribs. The restrictor device will hold the
bones in place, let them <br>
PICARD: Let them knit? <br>
ANNA: It's been so long since I talked to anyone. I used to talk to
myself, but then I thought it might mean that I was crazy, so I stopped
talking. It'll be a while before you can walk. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps you could go to the shuttle bring the equipment back
here. <br>
ANNA: I can do that. <br>
PICARD: Good. Go into the cockpit, and look for a small comm. panel in
the instrument array. See if you can remove it. Bring it back here. <br>

WORF: I have failed in my mission, Commander. I am clearly a bad
diplomat. For the sake of the ship and the Federation, I request
reassignment. <br>
RIKER: Denied. <br>
WORF: Commander, these Iyaarans are arrogant, irritating. They cannot
be reasoned with! <br>
TROI: Ambassador Loquel's quite pleasant. I will admit though, he's a
little unusual. <br>
RIKER: What have you been able to find out about him so far? <br>
TROI: He seems preoccupied with recreation. I've spent more time in Ten
Forward in the last two days than I have in the past two months. And
he's obsessed with food. Especially chocolate. <br>
RIKER: You must be in heaven. <br>
TROI: To be honest, he's testing even my limits. <br>
WORF: You see? You see? They are insane! <br>
TROI: Worf, you've been very patient with Ambassador Byleth, and that's
good. But maybe it's time to let him know that some behaviour is
unacceptable to us. I think it's all right to suggest limits for the
Ambassador. <br>
WORF: Bah. <br>
RIKER: Maybe we should loosen things up a little bit, meet in a less
official capacity. How about a friendly game of poker?

ANNA: What are you doing? You should be in bed. <br>
PICARD: Anna, why was this door locked from the outside? <br>
ANNA: For your protection. <br>
PICARD: From what? <br>
ANNA: There are dangerous animals here. Come sit down. Look, I have the
comm. panel. <br>
PICARD: Good. <br>
ANNA: It wasn't easy. I had to force it out of the equipment bay. <br>
PICARD: If we can boost the output field, I might be able to send a
distress signal.
Something seems to be wrong with it. <br>
ANNA: What's the matter? <br>
PICARD: This transmitter module has been totally destroyed. How could
that happen? It looks as though it's been hit by a phaser blast. <br>
ANNA: I used a phaser to cut it free. Maybe I accidentally damaged it.
You can fix it, can't you? <br>
PICARD: No. <br>
ANNA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. <br>
PICARD: Anna, we will get out of here. It's not going to be easy, but
we need to work together. <br>
ANNA: I can't believe I did that. That I damaged our only chance. I've
waited for so long. At first, I had hoped that I'd be rescued. I kept
setting up microfusion flares and looking up at the sky and waiting for
someone to come and take me away. But it never happened. There's a
precipice near here. I used to go there and stare down at the gorge and
I'd think, I can just step over the edge and end it all.
And then I realised it was the hope that was driving me crazy, that I
had to accept that I would never get out of here. <br>
PICARD: Anna, no matter how long it takes, we will get out of here. <br>
ANNA: I knew from the moment I saw you that you were here to save me.
I'll do anything you want. Just don't leave me. I don't ever want to be
alone again. <br>
(Anna kisses Picard) <br>
ANNA: I love you. <br>
(later, Picard is working on some equipment when Anna comes in) <br>
ANNA: I found some coltayin roots. They're not much to look at but they
taste good. What are you doing? You're going to hurt yourself. <br>
PICARD: No, no, no, it's all right. I'm just trying to dislodge this
power cell. Nearly got it. There. No, no, it's all right. The energy
relays are corroded but I think it should be able to hold one more
charge. If I can regenerate this, then I may be able to reactivate the
shuttlecraft's engines. <br>
ANNA: Well, I'd say this is cause for celebration. I may still have
some Terellian spices around here, and I'll boil these roots and make
us a nice broth. <br>
PICARD: That sounds delightful. <br>
ANNA: If we ever do get out of here, will you promise to show me this
starship of yours? This Enterprise? <br>
PICARD: Of course. Anna, would you pass me that tricorder, I'm going to
try to repair these energy relays. <br>
ANNA: I meant what I said before. I do love you. <br>
PICARD: Anna, I'm grateful to you for saving my life, and I think that
you are a warm and compassionate person, and I feel a great sympathy
for what you've been through alone here on this planet, but I don't
think that you can really be in love with me. <br>
ANNA: How can you say that? Of course I love you. <br>
PICARD: No, I'm the first person you've seen in seven years. I'm
bringing you the hope of leaving this place. Don't you think that you
could possibly be just a little confused right now? <br>
ANNA: So you're not attracted to me. <br>
PICARD: I think that's a little premature. We hardly know anything
about each other. <br>
ANNA: I understand, and I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable. <br>
PICARD: No harm done. It's going to take at least a couple of hours to
charge this cell. Then as soon as it's done, we should get it over to
the shuttle immediately. This cell casing is already beginning to break
down. Anna, we are going to get out of here.

easily be mistaken for death. <br>

PICARD: Anna! Anna! <br>
VOVAL: Captain, this ridge extends for a kilometre in either direction.
<br>
PICARD: We can search it twice as fast if we separate. <br>
(so they head off in opposite directions) <br>
PICARD: Anna! Anna! <br>
(Picard sees Anna standing by the edge in the other direction) <br>
PICARD: Anna, Anna. <br>
ANNA: Stay away from me. <br>
PICARD: You don't have to do this. I found Voval, the shuttle pilot,
he's still alive. He can help us get away from here. <br>
ANNA: I don't care. I'll jump unless you promise to love me. <br>
PICARD: No. No, I won't promise. You have been manipulating me, haven't
you? <br>
ANNA: Jean-Luc, what are you saying? <br>
PICARD: The necklace. It broke. I saw it in the cargo freighter, on the
floor by the fire. I left it there. Now it's around your neck. It's
whole. How? <br>
ANNA: Tell me you love me. I must know. <br>
PICARD: Where's Voval? Isn't it convenient that he arrived moments
after you left? That he insisted that I come here to look for you? That
I find you, here on the ledge, ready to jump? That's very good timing,
don't you think? <br>
ANNA: Jean-Luc. <br>
PICARD: Are you and Voval working together? He's the only one who could
have brought you the necklace. <br>
ANNA: Tell me about your love or I'll jump! <br>
PICARD: Go ahead. Why don't you do it? It's a long way down. Must be
two hundred metres. You'd die instantly, if that's what you want. But I
don't think that it really is. <br>
(Anna touches her pendent and turns into Voval) <br>
VOVAL: I have failed. <br>
PICARD: Failed? Voval, what is going on? <br>
VOVAL: My name is Ambassador Voval. <br>
PICARD: Ambassador? <br>
VOVAL: My mission was to study human intimacy, specifically the concept
you call love. In our study of your culture, we did not understand
certain concepts. So we sent three representatives to study them, to
experience them. <br>
PICARD: But why did you believe that bringing me here would give you a
better understanding of love? <br>
VOVAL: Several years ago, we discovered the remains of the Terellian
freighter on this planet. The ship contained logs made by a single
survivor, a human woman. That was our first contact with human culture.
The woman lived alone here for seven years until another human crashed
on this planet. A human male. <br>
PICARD: And the man was injured and she nursed him back to health, and
they fell in love. <br>
VOVAL: In the logs, she described many concepts we found difficult to
understand. Pleasure, antagonism, love. These were alien to us. We
wished to experience them for ourselves. Ambassador Loquel was sent to
experience pleasure. Byleth was sent to experience antagonism. And I
was sent to experience love. Was this wrong? <br>
PICARD: Let me just say that we would not take such a direct approach.
Ambassador, I have tell you that in my culture, what you have done
would be considered a crime. <br>
VOVAL: Crime? <br>
PICARD: Well, we'll can talk about it later. For now, I think we should
get off this planet. Am I in assuming the damage the shuttle is not as
bad as it seems? <br>
VOVAL: That is correct. We can leave at any time. <br>
PICARD: I think that now would be quite nice. </font></p>

BYLETH: Lieutenant Worf was kind enough to engage me in eleven hours of
holodeck battle exercises. <br>
RIKER: Eleven hours. <br>
BYLETH: Yes, I learned a great deal about the concept of antagonism. <br>
WORF: (happily) It was excruciating. <br>
LOQUEL: Counsellor, these are bio-enzymatic supplements my people
consume for food. I'm afraid you will find they are not as delicious as
your chocolate. <br>
TROI: After the past few days, I could use something a little bland.
Goodbye, Ambassador. <br>
LOQUEL: (to Byleth) Fascinating species. <br>
BYLETH: Indeed. <br>
(Voval and Picard come out of the shuttle) <br>
VOVAL: Thank you, Captain. This has been an enlightening experience. <br>
PICARD: For me as well, Ambassador. <br>
VOVAL: I am sorry if our diplomatic methods offended you. <br>
PICARD: No, on the contrary, I found your approach intriguing. We
humans tend to take a rather balanced approach towards life. Never too
much, never too little, and it's very nice to find a culture that is
willing to take an experience to its furthest extreme. <br>
VOVAL: Goodbye, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Ambassador. </font> </p>
