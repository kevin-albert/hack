officer's log, stardate 41986.0. We are awaiting the return of Captain
Picard who was summoned to Starbase 718 for an emergency conference.
Meanwhile, our sensors are monitoring an ancient capsule floating in
our vicinity which appears to be from Earth. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: I wonder how it got out here. <br>
WORF: At its present speed and heading, it will eventually enter the
Kazis binary system and will certainly be destroyed. I could attach a
tractor beam and adjust its heading. <br>
RIKER: I think not, Mister Worf. It's just a piece of space debris. If
we hadn't sitting here waiting for the Captain, we wouldn't have
noticed it. Leave it be. Let nature take its course. How long until
Captain Picard returns? <br>
WORF: The last communication indicated it would be several hours. <br>
DATA: Commander, request permission to investigate this vehicle. <br>
RIKER: Why, Data? It's just a derelict. <br>
DATA: It is a piece of history. The opportunity to examine such an
ancient vehicle does not come around very often, and as you pointed
out, we do have the time. <br>
RIKER: Very well. Be prepared to beam back before the Captain returns. <br>
DATA: Thank you, sir. <br>
RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, go with him. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Minimal oxygen atmosphere. An ancient solar
generator, still operating. <br>
WORF: Commander, look at this. <br>
DATA: The on-board computers have ceased functioning. I may be able to
download this old style disk drive back to the Enterprise. <br>
(Worf tries to walk through the next hatch, but it does not
automatically open for him) <br>
WORF: It must be sealed, probably with age. (he prepares his phaser) <br>

WORF: Here's another. <br>
DATA: This one is empty. <br>
WORF: Commander, look at this. <br>
(They look at the face of a woman. Other capsules reveal two men still
intact) <br>
WORF: Were they frozen for an extended journey? <br>

sophisticated monitoring system. These containers were designed solely
for refrigeration. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Two Federation outposts in sector three
zero have been destroyed. There's been no communication with Federation
starbases in sector three one since stardate 41903.2. <br>
WORF: Romulans. <br>
PICARD: That's the assumption. <br>
RIKER: There's been no direct contact with the Romulans since the Tomed
Incident. <br>
PICARD: The question are, why now? What's their objective? For fifty
years there's barely a whisper out of them, and now for no apparent
reason they seem to be back with a roar. <br>
RIKER: Everything we know about them is based on rumour or conjecture. <br>
PICARD: The strategic decision is to send one ship. <br>
RIKER: The Enterprise. <br>
WORF: We could get out there and find ourselves greatly over-matched. <br>
PICARD: True enough. It's a gamble. <br>
RIKER: This first encounter, coming so suddenly after all this time. We
have to assume it's a setup. <br>
PICARD: If force is necessary, we will use it, but that will mean we
have failed. Our goal here is to establish some kind of relations with
the Romulans. If we don't succeed, then to convince them of our
resolve. The general feeling at Starfleet is that they are seeking a
confrontation. They may want to test themselves in battle against a
Federation starship. See how far we have advanced. If that is the case,
then I need to know it. Counsellor, I shall need a full profile on
them. <br>
TROI: There is limited information, but I will prepare something. <br>
PICARD: Computer, estimated arrival time at the Neutral Zone? <br>
COMPUTER: Nineteen hours, twenty eight minutes. <br>
PICARD: Let's reassemble in six hours. Stay sharp. No surprises. I
would rather outthink them than outfight them. Questions?

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: What is it, Doctor? <br>
CRUSHER: It's the people from the capsule. <br>
PICARD: Capsule? People? What people? <br>
CRUSHER: The people Data beamed over. <br>
PICARD: I wasn't aware that he had. <br>
CRUSHER: Well he did, and they were frozen. I thawed them. <br>
PICARD: You what? <br>
CRUSHER: I didn't know what else to do. The crypts in which they were
frozen were literally falling apart. <br>
PICARD: So what's their condition? <br>
CRUSHER: Right now, they are all sleeping. Each of them needed minor
medical attention. Minor now, but then their conditions were obviously
terminal. One had a heart problem, another had an advanced case of
emphysema with extensive liver damage. You know the most surprising
thing of all, is that each of them had been frozen after they died. <br>
PICARD: After they died? <br>
CRUSHER: Cryonics. It was a kind of fad in the late twentieth century.
People feared dying. It terrified them. At the moment of death, they
would be frozen, so that later, some time in the future, when
presumably medical science had a cure for whatever killed them, they
could be thawed back to life, healed, and sent on about their business.
<br>
PICARD: In the case of this group, it apparently worked. Mister Data,
will you report to Sickbay.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Look, I am never critical of any member of
my staff being curious, but it's just that the timing is so <br>
DATA: I could not leave them there, Captain. The condition of their
vehicle was deteriorating. <br>
PICARD: But Data, they were already dead. I mean, what more could have
happened to them? <br>
DATA: I see your point, Captain, but at the time it seemed the proper
thing to do. <br>
PICARD: Well, they're alive now. We're going to have to treat them as
living human beings. <br>
CRUSHER: Alive and well and ready to be awakened. <br>
PICARD: Before you wake them up, I want to have Security here.
Lieutenant Worf, report to Sickbay. <br>
CRUSHER: I have them sedated now, but they should be up and about as
soon as possible. <br>
PICARD: Well, then we have no other choice. <br>
CRUSHER: None that I can see. <br>
(Worf enters, and Beverly puts a hypo to the woman's neck. She wakes,
sees Picard, then Beverly, and smiles. Then she starts to sit up, sees
Worf, and faints) <br>
PICARD: Welcome to the twenty fourth century. <br>
DATA: I was able to retrieve some information from the ancient disk I
removed from the module's computer. Her name is Clare Raymond, age
thirty five, occupation homemaker. Must be some kind of construction
work. <br>
CRUSHER: She died of an embolism. It probably happened very suddenly,
otherwise her physical condition was excellent. <br>
(A nurse wakes Clare up, again) <br>
DATA: His name is Ralph Offenhouse, age fifty five, occupation
financier. <br>
CRUSHER: Advanced cardiomyopathy. Inoperable at the time, but easily
correctable now. He must have known his condition was terminal for
quite some time. <br>
(Ralph is woken) <br>
DATA: Much of his file we could not retrieved. His name is L Q Sonny
Clemonds. Apparently his occupation had something to do with music. <br>
CRUSHER: There was marked deterioration of every system in his body.
Probably from massive chemical abuse. Unbelievable. <br>
PICARD: That sounds like someone who hated life. Yet he had himself
frozen presumably so he could go through it all again. <br>
CRUSHER: Too afraid to live, too scared to die. <br>
PICARD: Doctor, this seems to be a situation more suited to your
talents. I'll leave it with you. I'll be on the Bridge.

RIKER: No, it's a vessel of the United Federation of Planets, and Earth
is a member. <br>
RALPH: What year is this? <br>

robot. <br>
CLARE: And him? The one I saw before, with the head? <br>
CRUSHER: She means Worf. <br>
RIKER: He's a Klingon. That takes a little more explanation. <br>
SONNY: Now, listen, guys. I paid some idiot a lot of money to freeze me
when I died, and I just got to hear the words. Am I alive? <br>
RIKER: Oh, yes. Absolutely. <br>
SONNY: And the liver that was about to explode in my face? <br>
CRUSHER: Perfectly sound. <br>
CLARE: Excuse me, could someone please tell me what's going on here? <br>

massive embolism. <br>
CLARE: I don't remember anything about that. <br>
CRUSHER: You and the others were frozen. <br>
SONNY: Cryonics. You know, freeze you now and heal you later. <br>
CLARE: Yeah, I've heard of it. I just never gave it much thought. How
did we get here? <br>
DATA: You were in a space module. <br>
SONNY: The whacko who sold me this scam said that by putting us in
orbit there weren't gonna be no chance of a brown out. <br>
RALPH: Yes, several cryonics companies fell into disrepute because of
power failures which adversely affected their refrigeration system.
Their stocks were severely depressed. <br>
SONNY: The whole deal was a long shot but I figured what the hell,
might as well give them the dough instead of leaving it to my ex-wives.
But you know, son, I figured it was all just a bunch of hooey. <br>
DATA: Hooey? Ah, as in hogwash, malarky, jive. An intentional
fabrication. <br>
SONNY: There you go, now you got it. <br>
RIKER: Now, if you didn't contract for this, who did? <br>
CLARE: It must have been my husband, Donald. If it was new and foolish,
he would have popped for it. Well, I'll say this for it. It's the first
thing he's ever bought into that worked. <br>
RALPH: I, for one, never had a doubt. My stock in this company must
have split at least a dozen times by now. <br>
DATA: Actually, the process of cryonics was never more than a fad, and
did not continue much beyond the mid-twenty first century. <br>
RALPH: I need to make a phone call as soon as possible. <br>
RIKER: A phone call? <br>
RALPH: Yes. I have provided for myself. I have a substantial portfolio.
It's critical that I check on it. Let the bank know that I am alive and
well. <br>
RIKER: Ah, that's going to be a little difficult right at the moment. <br>
RALPH: Well, do you at least have a copy of The Wall Street Journal? <br>
RIKER: I think we should take the Doctor's advice. Take this very
slowly until we've all adjusted, and then we'll talk to the Captain.

PICARD: Counsellor, anything would be helpful. <br>
TROI: They seem to be creatures of extremes. One moment violent beyond
description, the next tender. They are related to the Vulcans, but as
each race developed, their differences grew wider. They are intensely
curious. Their belief in their own superiority is beyond arrogance. For
some reason they have exhibited a fascination with humans and it is
that fascination, more than anything else, that has kept the peace. One
other thing. They will not initiate anything. They will wait for you to

LAFORGE: By the Romulans? <br>

seven months, eighteen days, we must consider that the information we
do have, is out of date. <br>

with us. <br>

will send their best. That'll give them a perfect chance to see
firsthand how far we've advanced both in technology and technique. <br>

assume the initiative. <br>
WORF: I agree with Commander Riker. This may be our only opportunity.
We should seize it. <br>

RALPH: Believe me, I'm fully cognisant of where I am, and when. It is
simply that I have more to protect than a man in your position could
possibly imagine. No offence, but a military career has never been
considered to be upwardly mobile. I must contact my lawyer. <br>
PICARD: Your lawyer has been dead for centuries. <br>
RALPH: Yes, of course I know that, but he was a full partner in a very
important firm. Rest assured, that firm is still operating. <br>
PICARD: That's what this is all about. A lot has changed in the past
three hundred years. People are no longer obsessed with the
accumulation of things. We've eliminated hunger, want, the need for
possessions. We have grown out of our infancy. <br>

about power. <br>

CLARE: I can't stop crying. I miss my sons, and then I think I'm here,

intentions aside, he'd mess up a free lunch. Why on Earth he ever
decided to do this? <br>
TROI: He must have thought you would have wanted it. <br>
CLARE: No, I can tell you exactly what happened. He couldn't think
about going on alone. I died and he couldn't face it, so he figured if
he had me frozen, then in his mind I wasn't really gone. It sounds
crazy, but you had to know Donald. I wish I knew what happened to my
children. Did they get married, did they have kids? <br>
TROI: Let's see if we can find out. Computer, this is Counsellor Troi.
Request personal history on. What are their names? <br>
CLARE: Tommy. He's eight, and Eddie's five. <br>
COMPUTER: Full names, date and place of birth. <br>
CLARE: They were born in Secaucus, that's in Jersey. Can this really
work? Can this tell me what's happened to them? <br>
TROI: Well, there must be a record somewhere. There is a good chance we
can find it. <br>
CLARE: Well, whether we do or not, I want to thank you for trying. Date
of birth. Tommy was born February seventeenth

RIKER: Captain, I recommend we transfer all power to phasers, and arm

It'll force them into taking a similar posture. We don't want to engage
in battle. <br>
RIKER: Captain, this is sufficient evidence. Outposts have been
destroyed. Countless lives have been lost. <br>
WORF: I have a positive lock. They're disengaging their cloaking

PICARD: Stay calm, everyone. Open hailing frequencies. <br>
WORF: Captain, these are Romulans. They are without honour. They killed

THEI [on viewscreen]: If our intent were aggression, you would not be
here now. <br>
TEBOK [On viewscreen]: If we go to war, let us be sure it is for the
right reason. We are here because our outposts, which border the
Neutral Zone, were also attacked. <br>
THEI [on viewscreen]: Destroyed in the exact same manner as your own. <br>
WORF: Even so, what gives them the right to enter Federation space? <br>
TEBOK [on viewscreen]: Silence your dog, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant Worf's question is valid. <br>
THEI [on viewscreen]: To even to ask such a question implies that we
need permission. We do not. <br>
PICARD: Do you think that we attacked your outposts? <br>
TEBOK [on viewscreen]: Once we realised the level of destruction, we
knew it could not have been you. <br>
PICARD: Who is responsible? <br>
RALPH: They haven't got a clue. They're hoping you know, but they're
too arrogant to ask. <br>
RIKER: You're out of line, Mister. <br>
PICARD: Yes, but it's a correct assessment. <br>
TEBOK [on viewscreen]: We do not know who is responsible. Why entire
outposts on both sides have been carried off. <br>
PICARD: I would like to offer a proposal. <br>
THEI [on viewscreen]: An alliance? Between the Romulans and the
Federation? <br>
PICARD: Nothing so grandiose. Just this. Cooperation. There was an
intent here. Whoever or whatever did this is more powerful than either
of us. Let's collaborate. Let's share whatever we learn about what has
happened here. <br>
THEI [on viewscreen]: Agreed. On this one issue. And only if it is
convenient and appropriate at the time. <br>
TEBOK [on viewscreen]: Captain Picard, because your actions are those
of a thoughtful man, I'll you this. Matters more urgent caused our
absence. Now, witness the result. Outposts destroyed, expansion of the
Federation everywhere. Yes, we have indeed been negligent, Captain. But
no more. <br>
PICARD: Commander, we have made some progress here. Let's not ruin that
with unnecessary posturing. <br>

my meaning, Captain? We are back. <br>
