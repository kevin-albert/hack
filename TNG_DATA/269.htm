TROI: (to a girl) That's very good. (to a boy) Well, that's very nice. <br>
ERIC: No, it isn't. I just can't get it right. Do you think the wings
are too big? <br>
TROI: Not at all. Birds have wings of all sizes, Eric. And you
shouldn't worry about making it look perfect. <br>
ERIC: But Mrs Narsu said we should try to make our sculptures as
realistic as possible. <br>
TROI: She's right. It is important that you be able to make the clay
take the shape you want it to have, but you're not supposed to be
concentrating on technique today. I'm here to help you focus on the
feelings you want to convey with your sculpture. For instance, what do
you think about when you see a bird? <br>
ERIC: Flying? <br>
TROI: Fine. So, make your sculpture make me think of flying, too. <br>
(She moves on to the big kid in the class) <br>
TROI: How's it going, Data? <br>
DATA: I have finished. <br>
(it's a perfect PADD) <br>
DATA: The dimensions are accurate to within one point three percent. <br>
TROI: I'm sure they are. Data, you obviously don't have a trouble with
realism, but you're here to work on your imagination. Maybe you should
try something a little more abstract. Here. I want you to start a new
piece. I'd like you to sculpt music. <br>
DATA: Counsellor, music is a collection of acoustic vibrations. How can
I reproduce a sound with clay? <br>
TROI: Well, think of the effects that sounds have on people, the images
that music brings to your mind, and then give it a form. <br>
(he quickly forms a treble clef) <br>
TROI: It's a start. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Data. Please report to the Bridge. <br>
DATA: Acknowledged, sir. On my way.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 47615.2. We have
encountered a rogue comet in sector one one five six. It is not native
to this region of space, and there is no previous record of this object
on any Federation charts.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Based on its present trajectory, the comet
appears to have originated in the D'Arsay system. <br>
RIKER: That's over two sectors away. <br>
DATA: That is correct, sir. This object has been en route for eighty
seven million years. <br>
RIKER: That's a long time alone in the dark. <br>
PICARD: Begin a full sensor analysis, Mister Data, and log the findings
with the Federation Astrophysical Survey. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. The comet's outer shell is composed primarily of
gaseous hydrogen and helium surrounding an icy mantle. The inner core
consists of heavier elements <br>
(a bright light sweeps the Bridge) <br>
PICARD: What was that? <br>
DATA: There is distortion within the comet's inner core. I believed we
experienced an intense sensor echo. <br>
RIKER: Can you correct for it? <br>
DATA: I am attempting to do so now, sir. I have compensated for the
effect. Sensors are reconfigured for a low intensity sweep. We are
still picking up some interference, but the distortion is manageable.
At these settings, the scan will be complete in thirty nine hours.

mok'bara throwing techniques today. <br>
TROI: More like falling techniques. Last time we did that I was sore
for a week. <br>
CRUSHER: What's this? <br>
(a three segment column with a rounded stone on top) <br>
TROI: I have no idea. I've never seen it before. <br>
CRUSHER: Maybe Will left it for you. A little present? <br>
TROI: It's not quite his style. <br>
CRUSHER: Then maybe it's a secret admirer. <br>
TROI: That's an interesting thought <br>
CRUSHER: Well, you'll figure it out later. Come on, we're going to be

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TROI: (to a child) That's nice. Data, this is
amazing. How did you come up with this? <br>
(Data has made a half-face mask with a compass rose motif on the
forehead) <br>
DATA: I followed your advice, Counsellor. I used my imagination. <br>
TROI: That's an understatement. <br>
DATA: For some reason, as I was shaping the clay, the image of the mask
was exceptionally clear in my mind. The design seemed to flow quite
naturally. <br>
TROI: Data, have you been in my quarters? <br>
DATA: No, Counsellor. <br>
TROI: Somebody left an object in my room. Some kind of artefact, and it
has something very similar to this. And you don't know anything about
it? <br>
DATA: I do not. <br>
ERIC: Excuse me, Counsellor. Can you help me with my terminal? It's not
working right. <br>
(the screen shows the mask and alien glyphs) <br>
DATA: Perhaps we should investigate this matter further.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: These symbols don't match anything in the
Federation linguistic banks. <br>
LAFORGE: Some kind of alien information has been downloaded into our
computer core. I don't know how it's working, but it's reconfiguring
our systems. <br>
RIKER: How did it get in? <br>
LAFORGE: I was able to trace its path from the replicators to the
sensor array. <br>
RIKER: The sensors? They've been scanning that comet for the past
eighteen hours. <br>
LAFORGE: Those energy readings from the comet's core, that sensor echo.
We still don't know what's inside that thing. <br>
RIKER: Maybe it's about time we found out. Could we use the phasers to
melt down the shell of the comet? <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, a dispersed wide-field beam might do the trick. It
wouldn't take long to come up with the firing parameters. What do you
think, Data? <br>
(Data is still staring at the screen) <br>
LAFORGE: Data? What's wrong? <br>
DATA: I believe I recognise these symbols. <br>
RIKER: How? <br>
DATA: I do not know. <br>
LAFORGE: Do you think maybe your systems have been affected? <br>
DATA: It is a possibility. I do not believe my systems are currently
impaired, but I will run a full diagnostic to make certain. <br>
RIKER: What do you think they mean? <br>
DATA: Boundary. Border. Road. Companion. Message. Messenger. <br>
(a golden sun-face fills the screen) <br>
LAFORGE: What's that one? <br>
DATA: Death.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: Captain, phasers are set for wide dispersal,
ten percent maximum power. The beam will automatically terminate once
the comet's core is reached. <br>
PICARD: Very well, Mister Worf. Fire. <br>
WORF: Phasers have terminated. <br>
(and now we see a curiously elegant alien construction, several times
the size of the Enterprise) <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, what are we looking at? Is it a ship? <br>
DATA: I do not know, sir. The object is nearly solid. It is composed
primarily of fortanium and several unknown materials. It is over eighty
seven million years old. <br>
RIKER: That's older than the comet itself. Could someone from the
D'Arsay system have built it? <br>
PICARD: There are no technologically advanced cultures in that system
now. But perhaps eighty seven million years ago, there were. <br>
RIKER: Why would they want to hide something like that inside a comet? <br>
PICARD: Possibly it accumulated those frozen gasses over time as it
travelled through space. <br>
LAFORGE: In any case, it's definitely responsible for the system
anomalies we've been experiencing. They're using our sensor beam as a
carrier wave to transmit information into our computers and
replicators. <br>
PICARD: But the question remains, why? What is its purpose? <br>
DATA: Captain, I believe this object is an informational archive. <br>
PICARD: Why do you say that, Mister Data? <br>
DATA: I do not know. However, I seem to have an intuitive understanding
of its function. <br>
LAFORGE: Data, the internal structure of that thing is pretty complex,
and it's got a repetitive node configuration which might suggest a
database of some kind, but it could be practically anything. I don't
see how you could know for sure what it is. <br>
PICARD: Data, do you believe that you're in communication with that
object? <br>
DATA: It is a possibility, sir. I recommend we run a level one
diagnostic of my positronic net immediately to determine if that is the
case. <br>
PICARD: Very well. Mister LaForge, give him a hand. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. <br>
RIKER: Do you think it's just trying to make contact with us? <br>
PICARD: Yes, it's possible. But if that is an archive from some ancient
civilisation, we should allow it to do so. But we must be careful.
Mister Worf, will you keep an eye on the sensors. If the ship is in any
danger, I want you to sever the connection immediately. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(there is a collection of new artefacts on Picard's
desk) <br>
PICARD: Come. <br>
RIKER: Captain? <br>
PICARD: Yes, come in, Number One. <br>
RIKER: We've confined the system corruption. It won't be spreading any
further. But we still have alien symbols floating around on our
computer. This is quite a collection you've assembled. I've seen these
things all over the ship. They all look the same. Primitive and
non-functional. <br>
PICARD: Ceremonial, and deceptively primitive. Only an advanced
technological society could have built that object out there. These
artefacts played a ritualistic role in that society, I think. <br>
RIKER: Do you think Data could be right? Could we have stumbled across
some sort of alien library? <br>
PICARD: Oh, yes, it's possible. And if so, this is a find of most
enormous significance. That library seems designed to do so much more
than simply store information. Who knows what we might learn from this?
<br>
RIKER: I keep seeing this design. <br>
PICARD: Yes, this symbol seems to be of particular significance. <br>
RIKER: What do you think it means? <br>
PICARD: The concept of the four cardinal compass directions is quite
common in many different cultures. <br>
RIKER: The words that Data recognised in the computer, boundary,
border, road, they were all arranged in this design. <br>
PICARD: Well, perhaps the artefacts that all have this compass symbol
belong to the same theme, movement. Finding a direction, travelling a
path, crossing a boundary. <br>
RIKER: And death? One of the symbols was death. <br>
PICARD: The ultimate boundary. <br>
PICARD: I've seen this symbol everywhere too, but much less prominently
displayed. It's always in the background, smaller than the others. <br>
(a straight line with a hemisphere below it showing a semicircle with
radiant lines - half a sun? ) <br>
RIKER: What do you think it represents? <br>

LAFORGE: This is a micrograph of what's happened to Data's positronic

counted fourteen so far. I think the archive is using Data to create
different people within its culture much in the same way it used our
replicators to create artefacts. <br>
TROI: As a result, Data's real personality has been completely buried.
In a sense, Data has the android equivalent of multiple personalities. <br>
LAFORGE: The archive hasn't stopped yet. Data's positronic net is still
being transformed. There's no telling how many more personalities might
emerge. <br>

PICARD: I'd say that that is Masaka. Ihat referred to her as a queen,
and it's not unusual in ceremonial cultures to find royalty symbolised
by a sun. <br>
TROI: You said the personalities inside Data were in awe of her, even
terrified. <br>
PICARD: According to Data, the sun image is also a symbol for death. <br>

PICARD: There it is again. The same U-shaped symbol, small and
insignificant. Almost as if it's an afterthought. <br>

over here from the archive. The matter here in Ten Forward has been

turned into a swamp. <br>
PICARD: So, what's our status? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, so far the archive has transformed about twenty percent
of the ship. We've lost main propulsion and weapons systems in the
process. <br>
RIKER: What about communications, sensors, life support? <br>
LAFORGE: We have communications, and limited sensor control. Life
support seems to be unaffected. <br>
CRUSHER: I've analysed the alien plant forms. They've developed from
biological matter we have on the ship. <br>
LAFORGE: The stone, the artefacts, are made in much the same way,
extrapolating from the ship's own alloys. <br>
CRUSHER: Apparently the archive can reorder and transform molecular
structure including DNA into anything it wants. <br>
PICARD: So it's using our ship, our alloys, our DNA, to create elements
of its own culture. <br>
TROI: But why is this happening? What does the archive hope to
accomplish? <br>
PICARD: Well, whatever the intent that lies behind its process, I'm not
going to permit this ship to be turned into an alien city. Mister La
Forge, do you have any ideas? <br>
LAFORGE: We still haven't been able to cut off that beam, but I have
managed to access the archive by sending an energy pulse back along
their signal path. If I can locate the transformation programme, I
might be able to control it. <br>
PICARD: That's a good idea, but I feel that the answer lies there, with
Masaka. We must find her, access her. Talk to her.

DATA-IHAT: You need the sign. I could give it to you. So could the old
man. But just try getting it out of him. <br>
PICARD: Give me the sign. <br>
DATA-IHAT: If she finds out, you can't imagine her rage. She lets
people die of thirst. A terrible death. Sometimes she burns them alive.
She is glorious. <br>
PICARD: Ihat, the sign, give it to me. <br>
DATA-IHAT: If she comes, you will take my place? <br>
PICARD: Yes. <br>
DATA-IHAT: All right. Quickly, give me your hand. A line, as the
unending horizon. A curve as. She has found me. <br>
PICARD: Masaka, show yourself. I will go with you. <br>
DATA-IHAT: It seems I was not fast enough. <br>
DATA-ELDER: So hard to stay warm. Are you one of my children? I can't
remember anymore. <br>
PICARD: I need your help. I need the sign for the temple. For Masaka's
temple. <br>
DATA-ELDER: It won't help you. Korgano no longer pursues her. Only he
can stop her. <br>
(Picard takes the old man's hand and draws in the dirt) <br>
PICARD: A line as the unending horizon. A curve as? A line as the
unending horizon. A curve <br>
DATA-ELDER: As the rolling hillside. A point as a distant bird. A ray
as the rising sun. <br>
PICARD: Thank you. <br>
DATA-ELDER: Now, come sit with me. Tend the fire. <br>
DATA-BOY: I'm alone. No one left to help me. She's coming. <br>
PICARD: Are all the others dead? Did Masaka kill them? <br>
DATA-BOY: No. She sent them away. It will take them days to die. <br>

PICARD: Any progress, Mister La Forge? <br>
LAFORGE: I think I've found the archive's transformation programme. <br>
PICARD: Will it accept the symbol for Masaka's temple? <br>
LAFORGE: I think so. I've isolated the program's input pathways.
They're keyed to accept symbols. If I input this one, it should
initiate the transformation process. <br>
RIKER: And create the temple? <br>
LAFORGE: I hope so. If this is the wrong symbol, it might turn the
Enterprise into a big chunk of rock. No way to know for sure. <br>
TROI: The question is, can we trust a personality from an alien archive
that seems bent on taking us over? <br>
PICARD: Ihat risked his life to show me that symbol, and Masaka killed
him for doing it. I think we have to risk it.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: This would seem that this is Masaka's
temple. <br>
WORF: There is no one else here. <br>
(Troi scans the Maya-esque structure) <br>
PICARD: Ihat said that if we created the temple, then it would get her
attention. It may be some time before she shows herself. <br>
(Troi goes up the steps to the throne) <br>
WORF: How will she do that? <br>
PICARD: I don't know. <br>
TROI: Captain, take a look at this. <br>
PICARD: This is the first time I've seen these two symbols paired. That
could be significant. Look, there it is again, and again. And there
again. This is obviously an important pairing. He isn't chasing her
anymore. <br>
TROI: Sir? <br>
PICARD: Ihat said that someone named Korgano isn't chasing Masaka
anymore. And the old man said, he pursues her no longer. In a sense,
this small symbol might be seen to be chasing Masaka. <br>
WORF: The symbol suggests antlers of some kind. Horns. Maybe it is
meant to represent an animal. <br>
TROI: Animals are worshipped in many cultures. <br>
PICARD: That smaller symbol could represent Korgano. Both Ihat and the
old man said that Korgano was the only one who could control Masaka.
Many ritualistic cultures incorporate the idea of balance into their
belief systems. Now, Masaka is a queen. A powerful, god-like figure.
It's not unrealistic to believe that she might have a counterpart, a
consort. Look around. See if you can find that horn-like symbol
anywhere else.

horn symbol we've seen yet. <br>
WORF: But now it appears as though Masaka's sun is chasing it. <br>
TROI: The sun chasing an animal? <br>
PICARD: Maybe it's simpler than that. Maybe their relationship is more
like the sun and the moon. <br>
WORF: I see. Masaka and Korgano switching positions. The sun setting
and the moon rising. <br>
PICARD: Exactly. Like two powerful rulers changing places in a
continuous cycle. <br>
TROI: And like the sun and the moon, only one of them can be in
ascendance at any given time. <br>
PICARD: If we can find Korgano in the archive and bring him out, then
perhaps he could force Masaka to leave. <br>
WORF: But would we be any better off with him? <br>
PICARD: Ihat and the others didn't seem to be frightened of Korgano. <br>

PICARD: Masaka, I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship
<br>

PICARD: Please, hear us. Your archive is destroying <br>
DATA-MASAKA: I do not hear you. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: I've found it, Captain. This is the only
place in the archive where Korgano's moon symbol appears by itself, not
linked with Masaka's. <br>
PICARD: All right, Mister La Forge, I want you to access the
transformation programme. And when you're ready, input the symbol. <br>
RIKER: Isn't that a little risky? <br>
TROI: We have no way idea what the result would be. The symbol might
generate anything from Korgano's temple to Korgano himself. <br>
PICARD: In one sense, Korgano is Masaka's nemesis. Whatever this symbol
represents, it could be for us a means to control her. Now, if anyone
has a better idea, I'd be happy to entertain it. <br>
LAFORGE: I've accessed the programme, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Initiate the transformation. <br>
(a mask appears) <br>
RIKER: Another mask. <br>
PICARD: You know, we could be going about this all the wrong way. This
is a very ritualistic culture based on symbol and myth. Perhaps we
should try to confront them on those terms. If I could somehow
incorporate myself in their ritual, then perhaps Masaka would listen to
me. <br>
RIKER: You're going to try to pose as Korgano? <br>
TROI: Captain, we know so little about this culture and even less about
Korgano. How would you convince Masaka that you're him? <br>
PICARD: I'm really not certain, but there are similarities between this
culture and others that I've studied. I would imagine I'm just going to
improvise. Mister Worf, what's our status? <br>
WORF: I estimate we have less than two hours before there is nothing
left of the ship. At least, nothing we can recognise.
