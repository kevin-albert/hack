PICARD: I thought you might find this interesting, Mister Crusher. Few
humans have ever seen an Antedean in the flesh. <br>
(Two aliens and a barrel are beamed aboard) <br>
PICARD: Welcome. I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. <br>
WESLEY: Are they alright, Captain? <br>
PICARD: Yes. This is their preferred way of space travel. <br>
PULASKI: Their physical condition is good enough, considering the
circumstances. <br>
PICARD: It is a self-induced catatonic state. Their way of dealing with
the trauma of spaceflight. <br>
WESLEY: Will we try to revive them? <br>
PICARD: No, not until we reach the Pacifica conference, three days from
now. Doctor, have you prepared a Sickbay facility to
accommodate our guests? <br>
PULASKI: As soon as I can make some adjustments. Their physiology is
unusual. You can store them for a few hours? <br>
O'BRIEN: Sure. I'll have them kept out of the way here. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, provide security. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>

WESLEY: What's in that container? <br>
PULASKI: Vermicula. It's their food. When they come out of stasis,
they'll be very hungry. <br>

Wesley? <br>
WESLEY: They are rather strange-looking, Commander. <br>
DATA: Judging a being by its physical appearance is the last major
human prejudice, Wesley. <br>
PICARD: Your point is well taken, Mister Data. I'm sure that to the
Antedeans, we are equally unattractive. <br>

TROI: Captain Picard, Mother. <br>

LWAXANA: Aaagh! <br>
PICARD: Explain to her. <br>
RIKER: I'm sorry they startled you, Mrs. Troi. They're Antedean
delegates. They're being stored here temporarily. <br>
LWAXANA: Delegates? Last time I saw something like that, it was being
served on a plate. Darling. Well, well, well. And you, Jean-Luc, I
wasn't aware you had such handsome legs. My valet is waiting. You may
beam him aboard now. <br>
LWAXANA: You remember Mister Homn, of course. <br>
PICARD: It would be hard to forget Mister Homn. <br>
LWAXANA: I retain his services despite the outlandishly lustful
thoughts he spews in my direction. You can put that down, Homn. We
can't deny the Captain the honour of carrying my belongings. <br>
PICARD: I will not interfere with Homn's duties this time. <br>
LWAXANA: That's not what you're really thinking, Jean-Luc. You forget
I'm a telepath. <br>
RIKER: Mrs.Troi, since this obviously significant to you, I'll (totally
fail to lift the case) I'll carry it. </font></p>

me. <br>
LWAXANA: I am be serving a Betazoid dinner of greeting tonight,
Captain. It is an ambassadorial function. <br>
PICARD: It sounds delightful. <br>
(Picard leaves) <br>
LWAXANA: He's a fine man. Solid, reliable. He's a little on the stuffy
side, but, all in all, he's not that bad. <br>
TROI: I can't believe you, Mother. You sound like you're sizing up a
commodity. <br>
LWAXANA: But that's exactly what men are, darling. Especially human
men. Was your father ever unhappy with me? <br>
TROI: No. He worshipped you. But I don't think I'll ever learn to see
men the way you do. <br>
LWAXANA: You will as you mature, darling. And the men in your life are
going to bless you for it. You're so beautiful.

Picard on his legs? <br>
DATA: I would have thought a telepath would be more discreet, sir. <br>
RIKER: Exactly the opposite. She knows what's in your mind and she lets
you know what's on hers. <br>
PICARD: Gentlemen. I think we must not lose sight of the fact that
we're talking about someone who has been granted ambassadorial rank.
Even though she may appear somewhat eccentric, Lwaxana Troi must be
treated with the appropriate respect. Is that understood? Picard to
Pulaski. <br>
PULASKI [OC]: Yes, Captain. <br>

LWAXANA: A toast to Earthmen, who, despite their faults, have that
unique ability to charm women of all races, in all corners of the
galaxy. <br>
PICARD: Speaking on behalf of men of Earth, which is indeed an awesome
responsibility, I thank you. <br>
LWAXANA: I know what you're thinking, Captain. <br>

LWAXANA: You're wondering whether I'm seeing any other man. On a
serious basis. <br>

LWAXANA: I wouldn't worry about it, Jean-Luc. Competition seems to
bring out the best in the human male. <br>
PICARD: The fact is, I wasn't expecting this setting. I had assumed
that my senior Bridge officers would be attending. <br>
LWAXANA: You never assume anything where Lwaxana Troi is concerned.
Betazoid women are full of surprises. Strange, I'm not really very
hungry tonight. I wonder what's made me lose my appetite? Any ideas? <br>
(Homn strikes a gong) <br>
PICARD: Of course, you're giving thanks for your food. I'd forgotten
about that. I wonder how many other cultures have similar customs. <br>
LWAXANA: I don't know. <br>
PICARD: Well, let's find out. Commander Data? <br>
DATA [OC]: Yes, Captain? <br>
PICARD: Mrs. Troi and I are having a very interesting discussion about
various societies' ways of giving thanks. The Betazoid use of the
chime, for instance. <br>

DATA: So, by using the square root of pi and multiplying it by nine to
the third power, I was able to accurately calculate the distance
between the Omicron system and the Crab Nebula. <br>
PICARD: Fascinating, Data, absolutely fascinating. I'm sure Mrs. Troi
would love to hear the one about the anomalous chemical composition of
brown dwarf stars. <br>
LWAXANA: Not really. <br>

PULASKI: Condition at this time? <br>
TROI: It's something that occurs to Betazoid females as they enter
mid-life. We call it the phase. <br>
PULASKI: Mid-life? As in a human female's menopause? <br>
TROI: Similar. It's only at mid-life that a Betazed female becomes,
well, fully sexual, if you know what I mean. <br>
PULASKI: Yes, I think I do. I also think that I saw the Captain on his
way to her quarters. <br>
TROI: I wonder if I shouldn't warn him? <br>

his reflexes and agility. <br>

now. <br>

PICARD: Don't misunderstand me, Counsellor. Your mother is a beautiful
person, <br>
TROI: My mother is beginning a physiological phase. It's one that all
Betazoid women must deal with as they enter mid-life. <br>
RIKER: Yes, it's something Troi warned me about when we first started
to see each other. A Betazoid woman, when she goes through this phase,
quadruples her sex drive. <br>
TROI: Or more. <br>
RIKER: Or more? You never told me that. <br>
TROI: I didn't want to frighten you. She has opted for the only
dignified option open to her. <br>
RIKER: Isolation? <br>
TROI: She has decided to focus all of her sexual energy on one male,
who will, of course, eventually become her husband. It seems, Captain,
that you are the early favourite. <br>
RIKER: Congratulations, sir! <br>
PICARD: I'm not amused, Number One. There must be some way to convince
her that it's quite impossible, without offending her. <br>
TROI: You cannot apply human style logic to this, Captain. A Betazoid
woman in the phase would be shocked and deeply resentful, should you
spurn any such advances. She would take it personally. <br>

were to make myself less available for the duration of this journey. <br>

MADELINE: It's one of the messages I left on your desk. <br>
PICARD: That sounds like an excellent idea. Would you care to join me? <br>
MADELINE: Me? Have a drink with you? <br>
PICARD: Why not? <br>
MADELINE: There ain't no why not about it. It's just that this is the
first time you ever asked. <br>
PICARD: Is that a problem? <br>
MADELINE: Not for me, but you'd better take this. (a revolver) <br>
PICARD: Why? <br>
MADELINE: Because if we're going to Rex's bar, you're gonna need it.

REX: Hey, Dix. What do you know and what do you say? See this?
(newspaper) Germany's getting ready to invade England. <br>
MADELINE: Who's going to stop them? <br>
REX: Somebody'd better. <br>
MADELINE: Just as long as it isn't us. The last thing America needs to
do is fight in another world war. <br>
PICARD: Actually, the Second World War, although disastrous, did end
with the United States taking its place as a dominant world power and
cultural influence in the second half of the twentieth century.
Additionally, that war was a catalyst of technological advancement.
Developments in rocketry and fission resonate on into the twenty fourth
century. <br>
REX: I don't know if I should pour you one, Dix. Sounds like you've got
a snootful already. <br>
PICARD: What's this? <br>
REX: The usual. <br>
PICARD: Ah, now let me see. That would be Scotch, neat. <br>
REX: What else? <br>

puff then looks at it from arms length) <br>
REX: And for the lady? <br>
MADELINE: Rye and ginger. <br>
(Rex taps the bar and rubs his fingers together. Picard imitates him) <br>
PICARD: Money. I keep forgetting the need to carry money. I must
remember not to let this happen again. <br>
REX: Right. I don't mind you being on the cuff, but you're up the
sleeve halfway to my collar. <br>
PICARD: Is that why you wanted to see me, about my bar bill? <br>
REX: No, it's on account of Jimmy Cuzzo. <br>
PICARD: Jimmy Cuzzo. I know that name. <br>
MADELINE: He's why I gave you the gun. <br>
PICARD: What was the name of that case he was involved in? The Parrot's
Claw. <br>
MADELINE: Jeez, Dix. Cuzzo's the guy who iced Marty O'Farron. They
never would have nailed him if it hadn't been for you. Your testimony
got him arraigned. <br>
REX: Yeah. Yours and mine. <br>
PICARD: So you brought me here because you didn't want to face him
alone. <br>
REX: I don't want to face him at all. I'm hoping that seeing us
together will slow him up long enough to get some things straight. <br>
PICARD: And if it doesn't? <br>
REX: Then you just have to kill him. </font></p>
