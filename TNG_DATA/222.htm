is visible in the next section) <br>
CLARA: I like to cook all kinds of stuff, like yogurt and raisin salad,
chocolate chip pancakes and purple omelettes. <br>
TROI: Purple omelettes? <br>
CLARA: You put grape juice in the eggs. Isabella doesn't like it very
much. She says it tastes funny. <br>
TROI: I can see her point. Sugar with your tea? <br>
CLARA: Yes, please. <br>
TROI: Isabella would you like some too? <br>
CLARA: Yes, but she takes two cubes. <br>
TROI: I'll bet Isabella is very pretty. <br>
CLARA: She's very, very pretty. She has blonde hair and a blue dress
with white buttons. Her ears are pierced and she's tall. <br>
TROI: Maybe you could draw me a picture. I'd love to see what she looks
like. <br>
CLARA: You don't think she's real. <br>
TROI: I think she's real for you, and that is real enough for me. <br>
SUTTER: Honey, I think it's time for you to go. You don't want to keep
Keiko waiting. <br>
CLARA: I have to go plant the nasturtiums now. I'm Keiko's helper in
the arboretum today. <br>
TROI: Is that so? <br>
SUTTER: You go ahead, sweetie, and be home for dinner. <br>
TROI: I hope I see you soon. Maybe we can be friends. <br>
CLARA: Okay. Counsellor Troi? <br>
TROI: Yes? <br>
CLARA: Isabella says she likes you. <br>
TROI: Why, thank you, Isabella. <br>
(Clara leaves) <br>
TROI: I can understand your concern, Ensign Sutter, but really you have
nothing to worry about. It's a normal, healthy activity for children to
engage in imaginary play. <br>
SUTTER: I'm just afraid she's not making any real friends. She spends
all of her time with Isabella. <br>
TROI: You've been moving from starship to starship since Clara was two
years old. Maybe Isabella provides a constant companion. She knows this
is one friend she won't have to leave behind. <br>
SUTTER: You're probably right. <br>
TROI: Give Clara a chance. As she learns to make friends on the
Enterprise, you'll probably find that she'll leave her imaginary world
behind.

arrived at FGC four seven, a nebula which has formed around a neutron

LAFORGE: We could steal a couple of hours from the Engineering team
while they're recalibrating the thermal interferometery scanner. <br>
DATA: Will two hours be enough time to complete the high-resolution

OGAWA: I'll run a diagnostic. <br>

CRUSHER: And? <br>
OGAWA: And? <br>
CRUSHER: After Paris? <br>
OGAWA: He has shore leave next month. He asked me to go to Risa with
him. <br>
CRUSHER: No problem. Nurse McClukidge can cover for you. <br>
OGAWA: I don't think I'm going, Doctor. I hear it's a very uninhibited
atmosphere. Personally, I don't think I'm ready for that kind of fun. <br>
CRUSHER: Try to talk him into Tavena Minor. They have a cruise down the
Jokri River. The iridescent currents are beautiful.

CLARA: See, Isabella? You have to push your finger into the soil as far
as it can go. I'm making a hole for the seeds. Now they need to be
watered. But the baby seeds are very small, so we mustn't give them too
much to drink. <br>
(the firefly passes through Clara's head, then a second voice joins in
with Clara's humming) <br>

ISABELLA: Hello. <br>

happy? <br>
CLARA: Yes, it's wonderful. <br>
ISABELLA: Can we go now? <br>
CLARA: We'd better finish planting the seeds first. <br>
ISABELLA: I'm tired of planting. Let's do something else. <br>
CLARA: Like what? <br>
ISABELLA: Like, I would really like to explore the ship. <br>
CLARA: We'd better finish planting first. I promised Keiko. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: So what are we going to name this nebula?
FGC forty seven just doesn't have the proper ring to it. <br>
SUTTER: Why don't we call it Sutter's Cloud? <br>
DATA: The rotational period of the neutron star is one point three five
seconds. <br>
LAFORGE: That's a bit on the long side. Sutter, let's see if you can
get a reading on the particle flux. <br>
SUTTER: Aye, sir. <br>
LAFORGE: I was thinking about something more along the lines of the La
Forge Nebula. It's got sort of a majestic sound, don't you think? <br>
DATA: Given the selections, I prefer FGC four seven. <br>
(the ship shakes) <br>
SUTTER: What was that? <br>
LAFORGE: It felt like we hit something. <br>

in the vicinity.

LAFORGE: Could be something wrong with the shields, Captain. We're
checking it out now. <br>
SUTTER: Systems are normal, sir. <br>
LAFORGE: So did we hit something or not? Shields say yes, sensors say
no. This is very strange. Ensign, give me a breakdown on shield energy
conversion and then run a spectral. (nearly steps on Clara) Whoa. Where
did you come from? <br>
CLARA: I'm Clara Sutter. That's my daddy. <br>
SUTTER: Clara, you can't be here right now. <br>

CLARA: But Daddy <br>
PICARD [OC]: Bridge to La Forge. Our speed is still dropping. <br>
LAFORGE: I hear you, Captain. I'm increasing the power to the impulse
engines, but forward velocity just isn't consistent with engine output.
<br>
PICARD [OC]: Explanation. <br>
LAFORGE: It seems like there's something increasing the drag
coefficient on the ship. </font></p>

Our velocity has fallen by twelve percent. Velocity is increasing.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: I don't have an explanation, Captain. We
seemed to hit something, then we started losing speed. So far as we can
tell, there's nothing out there to hit. <br>
RIKER: Could some kind of damping field have caused us to lose
velocity? <br>
DATA: We have simulated several such fields, but were unable to
reproduce the same drag coefficient. <br>
LAFORGE: And we still don't know why the problem suddenly corrected
itself. <br>
PICARD: It seems we're looking a unique phenomenon. One that hasn't
been recorded before. <br>
LAFORGE: The question is, do we stay here and check it out? <br>
RIKER: Might be dangerous. <br>
DATA: Since we have only experienced the phenomenon once, it is
impossible to estimate the risks. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, I'd like to stay here for a little bit, collect some
samples of the gaseous matter, see what it tells us. <br>

secrets. <br>

CLARA: If they're lucky. Before I had you, I didn't have one. <br>
ISABELLA: Why not? <br>
CLARA: Every time I made friends with someone, my daddy's job would
change and we'd move to a new ship. It takes time to make a best
friend. <br>
ISABELLA: How long? <br>
CLARA: It depends. With you, not very long. You always listened to me,
even when I was sad. <br>

LAFORGE: We'll take samples from eight random sections. That ought to
give us a reliable measure. <br>
SUTTER: Commander, I understand that you had a parent who was in
Starfleet. <br>
LAFORGE: Two of them, as a matter of fact. My father was an
exozoologist, my mother a Command officer. <br>
SUTTER: They must have been posted to a lot of different assignments. <br>
LAFORGE: That's putting it mildly. They were always on the move. Some
of the time together, sometimes separately. I never knew whether or not
I was going to be stationed with my father while he studied
invertebrates in the Modean system or on some outpost near the Neutral
Zone with my mom. <br>
SUTTER: Was that hard on you? <br>
LAFORGE: I don't remember it that way. <br>
SUTTER: It must have been disruptive if you didn't stay in one place
long enough to make friends. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, I suppose there were aspects of my childhood that were
less than ideal, but to me it was just one long adventure. Children are
a lot stronger than you think. As long as they know you love them, they
can handle just about anything life throws at them, you know. <br>

processes inherent in the large scale motion of highly rarified gas. <br>
GUINAN: No, no. First it was a fish, and now it's a Mintonian sailing
ship. <br>

GUINAN: Right there. Don't you see the two swirls coming together to

DATA: I do not see it. It is interesting that people try to find
meaningful patterns in things that are essentially
random. I have noticed that the images they perceive sometimes suggest
what they are thinking about at that particular moment. Besides, it is
clearly a bunny rabbit. <br>

you looking for someone? <br>

GUINAN: Well, most grown-ups have a hard time with things they can't
see. <br>
CLARA: Why? <br>
GUINAN: Well, because they get preoccupied by other things. <br>
CLARA: Like what? <br>
GUINAN: Like how much fuel it takes to power a ship, or whether we
should go to one star system or another, or whether little girls should
go to bed at seven or be
allowed to stay up till eight. So their heads can get so full that they
forget about the things that are important to you and me, like
imaginary friends. <br>
CLARA: If the other grown-ups don't understand, how come you do? <br>
GUINAN: Maybe because when I was your age, I had one. <br>
CLARA: You did? What was she like? <br>
GUINAN: It wasn't a she. <br>
CLARA: What was he like? <br>
GUINAN: It wasn't a he. <br>
CLARA: It? <br>
GUINAN: It was a Tarkassian razor beast. It had dark brown fur and gold
eyes and huge spiny wings, and it would fly so fast nobody could see it
except me. <br>
CLARA: Sounds scary. <br>
GUINAN: Oh, it was, especially when he smiled. But the best thing about
him was I could curl up on his furry belly, and he had the softest purr
you ever heard. It put me right to sleep every night. I tell you, that
razorbeast was a good friend. <br>

LAFORGE: Yeah, take a look at this. We tried radiating the subject
matter with just about everything we could think of. We didn't find
anything until we subjected it to a high frequency warp field. We think
this is what we've been running into. <br>
RIKER: Do you know what it is? <br>
LAFORGE: We think so, now that the sensors can read it. It seems to be
a highly cohesive form of plasma, like a strand of energy. <br>
SUTTER: We figure it's a segment of just part of a network of much
larger strands. <br>
LAFORGE: When these things come in contact with our shields it produces
a resonant effect, and that creates the drag coefficient we've been
experiencing. <br>
RIKER: Is there anything like this on record? <br>
LAFORGE: No, sir. <br>
RIKER: Do you know how many of them there might be? <br>
LAFORGE: No, but if we run the warp field generators through the

wanted to. <br>

dangerous. <br>

we knew was that a little girl's imaginary friend was frightening her,
threatening her. <br>
ISABELLA: That was only after you told Clara not to be my friend. <br>
PICARD: I understand. You are seeing this ship, all of us, from a
unique perspective. From a child's point of view. It must seem terribly
unfair and restrictive to you. As adults, we don't always stop to
consider how everything we say and do shapes the impressions of young
people. But if you're judging us as a people by the way we treat our
children, and I think there can be better criterion, then you must
understand how deeply we care for them. When our children are young,
they don't understand what might be dangerous. Our rules are to keep
them from harm, real or imagined, and that's part of the continuity of
our human species. When Clara grows up, she will make rules for her
children to protect them, as we protect her. <br>
CLARA: Please don't hurt us. If you still want to be my best friend,
I'd like that very much. <br>
