Captain's log, stardate 45571.2. We are going into orbit around an
unexplored M-class moon of Mab-Bu Six. Though the moon was reported to
be uninhabited, we have picked up a weak distress call.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: The intense electromagnetic whirlwinds on the
moon's surface make it virtually impossible to locate the source of the
signal, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Any indications of life, Mister Worf? <br>
WORF: Scanners read negative, sir, but they may be affected by the
interference. <br>
RIKER: Have you ever heard anything like this, Data? <br>
DATA: I believe so, Commander. At Starfleet Academy. <br>
PICARD: The Academy? <br>
DATA: I will verify it. Just as I thought. It is a Starfleet subspace
distress signal, standard to Daedalus-class starships. <br>
RIKER: There hasn't been a Daedalus class in service for what? <br>
DATA: One hundred seventy two years, sir. <br>
PICARD: Are there any records of missing ships in this vicinity? <br>
DATA: The USS Essex under the command of Captain Bryce Shumar
disappeared in this sector over two centuries ago. <br>
PICARD: Daedalus class. <br>
DATA: I have accessed the subspace transponder signature of the Essex.
It is identical to the signal coming from the moon's surface. <br>
RIKER: W arrived a little late. <br>
PICARD: Mute it, Mister Data. With that storm activity down there, it
isn't worth the risk to check on a ghost ship. Advise Starfleet that we
have solved the mystery of Captain Shumar and the Essex. <br>
TROI: I'm not sure we have. Someone's down there. Alive.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First officer's log, supplemental. The
electromagnetic interference on the surface has been judged too
dangerous for anyone to transport down, so we have taken a shuttle to
investigate.

harnesses
to keep them in their seats) <br>
DATA: Shields are holding, sir. <br>
RIKER: Wind shear is incredible. Data, keep an eye on the stabilisers.
If it's anything like this on the ground, I don't see how anyone can
survive on this moon for long. <br>
TROI: Maybe they've been living underground. <br>
RIKER: Question is where? I still can't locate the source of the damn
signal. It's bouncing around more than we are. <br>
DATA: Forward thrusters have failed, sir. We are losing power. <br>
RIKER: Enterprise!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RO: The shuttle has crashed on the surface. <br>
PICARD: Do we have their position? <br>
WORF: I am picking up the shuttle's trace signature, but the surface
interference is distorting its position. <br>
PICARD: Can you locate them? <br>
RO: I think I can. I followed their entry almost all the way in. We can
calculate the coordinates from the angle of descent. </font></p>

TROI: Your arm. <br>
RIKER: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's broken. Enterprise? <br>
DATA: It is unlikely that we will be able to establish communication
with the ship, given the electromagnetic interference. <br>
RIKER: We'll stay in the area until the Enterprise finds us. Take an
inventory of the shuttle. See if there's anything left in there that's
usable. The ground cover is all non-porous rock, which makes me believe
it's even less likely there's anyone living here. <br>
DATA: There are no instruments left of practical value that have not
been damaged by our landing, sir. <br>
TROI: What is that? <br>
RIKER: That doesn't look like any storm front I've ever seen. <br>
DATA: The tricorder is picking up high levels of EM bursts across the
spectrum. No lifesign readings other than our own. <br>
TROI: There is someone alive here. I'm more certain of it now than
ever. <br>
RIKER: Well, I hope they can find us, because there's no way we'll find
them. <br>
TROI: They're coming. They're coming with the storm. </font></p>

enhancer. <br>
LAFORGE: Chief, there's no guarantee you won't rematerialise in a
million pieces if your signal gets caught up in that electromagnetic
whirlwind. <br>
O'BRIEN: I can boost the confinement beam. One person might be able to
make it. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, Chief O'Brien wants to beam down to the surface with
a pattern enhancer. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Mister O'Brien! Nice of you to join us. <br>
O'BRIEN: Nice spot for a picnic, sir. We need to distribute these
enhancer rods at seven metre lengths. That should do it. <br>
RIKER: Is this storm front going to interfere with the transport,
Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'd really like to get us out of here before it hits,
Commander. I'm supposed to be feeding the baby lunch. Molly gets in a
terribly foul mood if I'm late. <br>
RIKER: I'm with you. <br>
(the sky is very angry) <br>
RIKER: Lunch time, Miles! Let's do it! <br>
(O'Brien goes to turn on the pattern enhancers, and gets hit by
lightning. They all fall down. Balls of light descend on them, but one
flies away from Riker, who wakes up. He activates the enhancers and
they are all beamed away)

TROI: My skin, it's tingling. <br>
CRUSHER: You're experiencing the afterimages of the electromagnetic

you to take your time, Counsellor. Doctor's orders. <br>
(Picard enters) <br>
PICARD: Injury report, Doctor? <br>
CRUSHER: Mostly minor abrasions. Commander Riker took the worst of it
with a broken arm.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: So what happened down there? <br>
RIKER: It was just one hell of a storm. It moved in on our position
faster than anything I've ever seen. <br>
PICARD: Was there any evidence of life? </font></p>

close to it. <br>
PICARD: Bridge. How do you suggest we proceed? <br>
RIKER: We need to adjust the scanners so they can penetrate those
storms. Do you have any ideas, Data? <br>
DATA: We might be able to employ virtual imaging to interpolate
(metallic sound) missing data. <br>
PICARD: Is something wrong, Commander?
<br>
DATA: My apologies. It seems my primary speech processors are
experiencing a minor fluctuation. I will have it corrected in a moment.

RIKER: Mister Data, deploy sensor scans when you're ready. Ensign, take
us to a synchronous orbit aligned around our crash site. <br>
(Picard and Troi leave) <br>
RO: Aye, sir. <br>
DATA: Sir, given the EM field properties of this moon, I recommend a
search pattern beginning in the southern polar region. <br>
RIKER: The polar region? That would be starting from scratch, Mister
Data. Our latest
readings would suggest that we begin our scan around our crash site. <br>
DATA: The Essex signal was never clearly located, sir. A systematic
survey of the moon from a polar orbit might be more practical. <br>
RIKER: Well, you might be right, but I'd like to give the crash site a
once over first. Maintain our current orbit. <br>
DATA: Understood, sir.

though they were calling to me. <br>

TROI: Perhaps, for an instant. It was like their voices were being
carried on the wind. <br>
PICARD: What were they trying to communicate? <br>
TROI: I'm not sure, but they were calling me to the southern polar
region. I believe that's where we should look for the Essex. </font></p>

last transporter trace patterns to their earlier records. They're
exactly the same, except in Troi, Data and O'Brien there's an unusual
synaptic activity. Some kind of anionic energy. It may be another
lifeform superimposing its neural patterns on our people. <br>
RIKER: Why wasn't I affected? <br>
CRUSHER: I don't know. The only difference between you and the others
was that you were injured. <br>
RIKER: My broken arm. <br>
CRUSHER: The fracture caused pain receptors to fire, which may have
made you immune to this energy. <br>
PICARD: If your theory is accurate, Doctor, what would happen if we
were to inflict pain on the others? <br>
CRUSHER: It might force whatever it is out of our people. <br>
RO: A plasma shock. It would be painful but it wouldn't cause any
physical harm. <br>
LAFORGE: I could hook up a modified laser scanner to a plasma inverter.
<br>
RIKER: What about Data? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, a plasma shock would definitely overload his neural net.
It'll work on him too. <br>
RIKER: We have to find a way to penetrate the forcefield around Ten
Forward. <br>
LAFORGE: I might be able to interrupt the forcefield for a few seconds,
but I'll be fighting the computer for control. Timing would be
critical. <br>

Steven Mullen (Data), and my Security Chief, Lieutenant Morgan Kelly.

PICARD: How did this happen to you? <br>
TROI: I can't explain how it happened. I only know that it did. The
Essex was caught in an electromagnetic storm just as your shuttle was.
Moments before we crashed, the bridge was struck by lightning. The ship
was ripped apart. Somehow, in that instant, our consciousness was
absorbed in the magnetic currents on the surface. <br>
PICARD: Why didn't you tell us this? Why the deception? The violence? <br>

manipulating you. <br>
TROI: Captain Picard has every right to be curious. <br>
DATA: He will try to delay until a rescue attempt is possible. <br>
TROI: I know that. I also know that he will make every effort to
protect the lives of his people. Since our demands are not excessive,
Captain, I hope you will see that it will be simpler to accede than to
risk further injuries. <br>
