DATA: Captain, I have identified the signal. It is from the USS
Jenolen, a Federation transport ship reported missing in this sector
seventy five years ago. <br>
RIKER: Code one alpha zero. Ship in distress. <br>
PICARD: Take us out of warp, Ensign. All stop. <br>
RAGER: (a dark lady) Aye, sir. <br>
(the ship shakes) <br>
PICARD: Report. <br>
WORF: We have entered a massive gravitational field, Captain. <br>
DATA: There are no stars or other stellar bodies listed on our
navigational charts. However, sensors indicate the presence of an
extremely strong gravitational source in this vicinity. <br>
PICARD: Can you localise the source of the gravitational field? <br>
(viewscreen shows a dark grey sphere) <br>
RIKER: Sensors? <br>
DATA: I am having difficulty scanning the object. It appears to be
approximately two hundred million kilometres in diameter. <br>
RIKER: That's nearly as large as the Earth's orbit around the sun. <br>
PICARD: Why didn't we detect this before now? <br>
DATA: The object's enormous mass is causing a great deal of gravimetric
interference. That might have prevented our sensors from detecting it
before we dropped out of warp. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, could this be a Dyson Sphere? <br>
DATA: The object does fit the general parameters of Dyson's theory. <br>
RIKER: A Dyson Sphere? <br>
PICARD: It's a very old theory, Number One. I'm not surprised that you
haven't heard of it. In the twentieth century, a physicist called
Freeman Dyson, postulated the theory that an enormous hollow sphere
could be constructed around a star. This would have the advantage of
harnessing all the radiant energy of that star. A population living on
the interior surface would have virtually inexhaustible sources of
power. <br>
RIKER: Are you saying you think there are people living in there? <br>
DATA: Possibly a great number of people, Commander. The interior
surface area of a sphere this size is the equivalent of more than two
hundred and fifty million class M planets. <br>
WORF: Sir, I have located the distress signal. It is coming from a
point in the northern hemisphere. <br>
PICARD: Ensign Rager, put us into synchronous orbit above that
position. <br>
RAGER: Aye, sir. <br>
(after a short while) <br>
DATA: I have located the Jenolen, sir. It is impacted on the surface of
the sphere. <br>
PICARD: Magnify. <br>
DATA: There are no life signs. However, there are several small power
emanations, and life support is still functioning on minimal levels. <br>
RIKER: Riker to Engineering. Geordi, join us in Transporter room three.
Mister Worf.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: This air's pretty stale. <br>
LAFORGE: Life support is barely operating. <br>
RIKER: See if you can increase the oxygen level. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
LAFORGE: Commander. The transporter is still online. It's being fed
power from the auxiliary systems. <br>
RIKER: The rematerialisation subroutine has been disabled. <br>
LAFORGE: That's not all. The phase inducers are connected to the
emitter array. The override is completely gone and the
pattern buffer's been locked into a continuous diagnostic cycle. <br>
RIKER: This doesn't make any sense. Locking the unit in a diagnostic
mode just sends the matter array through the pattern buffer. Why would
anyone want to <br>
LAFORGE: There's a pattern in the buffer still. <br>
RIKER: It's completely intact. There's less than point zero zero three
percent signal degradation. How is that possible? <br>
LAFORGE: I don't know. I've never seen a transporter jury-rigged like
this. <br>
RIKER: Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for seventy
five years? <br>
LAFORGE: I know a way to find out. <br>
(The portly, silver-haired, late middle-aged figure of a certain
starship chief engineer materialises. He is wearing a TOS movie era
uniform and his left arm in a sling) <br>
SCOTT: Thank you, lad. We've got to get Franklin out of there. <br>
LAFORGE: Someone else's pattern is still in the buffer? <br>
SCOTT: Aye, lad. Franklin. We went in together. Something's wrong. One
of the inducers has failed. Boost the gain on the matter stream. Come
on, Franklin. I know you're still in there. It's no use. His pattern's
degraded fifty three percent. He's gone. <br>
RIKER: I'm sorry. <br>
SCOTT: So am I. He was a good lad. <br>
RIKER: I'm Commander William Riker, starship Enterprise. Lieutenant
Commander Geordi La Forge. <br>
SCOTT: The Enterprise? I should have known. I bet Jim Kirk himself
hauled the old girl out of mothballs to come looking for me. Captain
Montgomery Scott. Tell me, how long have I been missing? <br>
RIKER: Well <br>
WORF: Sir. I have restored life support. The oxygen levels will return
to normal shortly. <br>
RIKER: Captain Scott, Lieutenant Worf. <br>
SCOTT: Lieutenant? <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
RIKER: Captain, perhaps there are a few things we should talk about.

Doctor Crusher will want to <br>
SCOTT: You've changed the resonator array. <br>
RIKER: Geordi, I think our guest is going to have a lot of engineering
questions. <br>
LAFORGE: Not to worry, Commander. I'll take care of him, sir. <br>
(Worf and Riker leave) <br>
SCOTT: What have you done with the duotronic enhancers? <br>
LAFORGE: Those were replaced with isolinear chips about forty years
ago. It's a lot more efficient now. That's an EPS power tap. <br>
SCOTT: Ah. <br>
LAFORGE: So, you were saying earlier that you were on your way to the
Norpin Colony when you had a warp engine failure?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SCOTT: Aye, that's right. We had an overload in one
of the plasma transfer conduits. The Captain brought us out of warp and
we hit some gravimetric interference and then there it was, as big as
life. Is that a conduit interface? <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, it is. You were saying its big as life. You mean the
Dyson Sphere? <br>
SCOTT: Aye, an actual Dyson Sphere. Can you imagine the engineering
skills needed to even design such a structure? <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, it's pretty amazing. So, what happened when you first
approached it? <br>
SCOTT: Well, we began a standard survey of the surface, and we were
just completing the initial orbital scan when our aft power coils
suddenly exploded. The ship got caught in the sphere's gravity well and
down we went. Franklin and I were the only ones to survive the crash. <br>
LAFORGE: Can I ask you a question? What in the world made you think of
using the transporter pattern buffer to survive? <br>
SCOTT: Well, we didn't have enough supplies to wait for a rescue, so we
had to think of something. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, but locking it into a diagnostic cycle so that the
pattern wouldn't degrade, and then cross-connecting it phase inducers
to provide a regenerative power source, that's absolutely brilliant. <br>
SCOTT: I think it was only fifty percent brilliant. Franklin deserved
better. <br>
LAFORGE: I think you're going to enjoy the twenty fourth century,
Mister Scott. We've made some pretty incredible advances these last
eighty years. <br>
SCOTT: From what I've seen, you've got a fine ship, Mister La Forge. A
real beauty here. I must admit to being a bit overwhelmed. <br>
LAFORGE: Wait until you see the holodeck.

humorous. It will ache for a few days, but it should be fine. <br>
SCOTT: Thank you. Well, I'll say this about your Enterprise. The
doctors are a fair sight prettier. <br>
PICARD: I'm Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Captain
Scott. <br>
SCOTT: Thank you, sir, and call me Scotty. <br>
PICARD: How are you feeling? <br>
SCOTT: I don't know. How am I feeling? <br>
CRUSHER: Other than a couple of bumps and bruises, I'd say you feel
fine for a man of a hundred and forty seven. <br>
SCOTT: I don't feel a day over a hundred and twenty. <br>
PICARD: I must say, I was little surprised when Commander Riker told me
that you were aboard the Jenolen. Our records didn't show you listed as
a member of the crew. <br>
SCOTT: Well, I was never actually a member of the crew. I was just a
passenger. I was heading for Norpin Five to settle down and enjoy my
retirement. <br>
PICARD: I see. Well, I would very much enjoy the opportunity to hear
you talk about your career. I'm sure you would have some fascinating
insights into the events of your time. <br>
SCOTT: I'd be happy to. <br>
PICARD: Good. Well, I look forward to it. Excuse me. Commander, we need
to begin a full spectrographic analysis of the Dyson Sphere. <br>
LAFORGE: I'll get right on it, sir. <br>
PICARD: Good. Once again, welcome on board, Captain. <br>
SCOTT: Sir. <br>
LAFORGE: I need to get down to Engineering and begin that analysis. <br>
SCOTT: Engineering? I thought you'd never ask. <br>
CRUSHER: Captain, the first thing you need to get is some rest. Now
this has been a shock to your system, and I want you to not push
yourself. <br>
LAFORGE: We're pretty busy down there, anyway, Captain Scott. I promise
I'd be happy to give you a tour just as soon as the doctor says it's
okay. <br>

KANE: These are standard guest quarters, sir. I can try and find
something bigger if you want. <br>

SCOTT: The Captain wanted to try a cold start of the warp engines. I
told him that without a proper phase lock it would take at least thirty

wouldn't believe me, so I had to come up with a new engine start-up
routine. Do you know that your dilithium crystals are going to
fracture? <br>
LAFORGE: We recomposite the crystals while they're still inside the
articulation frame. Look, Mister Scott, I'd love to explain everything
to you, but the Captain wants this spectrographic analysis done by
thirteen hundred hours. <br>
SCOTT: Do you mind a little advice? Starfleet captains are like
children. They want everything right now and they want it their way,
but the secret is to give them only what they need, not what they want.

LAFORGE: Yeah, well I told the Captain I'd have this analysis done in
an hour. <br>

aboard eleven ships. Freighters, cruisers, starships, but this is the
only one I think of. The only one I miss. <br>
PICARD: The first ship I ever served aboard as Captain was called the
Stargazer. It was an overworked, underpowered vessel, always on the
verge of flying apart at the seams. In every measurable sense, my
Enterprise is far superior. But there are times when I would give
almost anything to command the Stargazer again. <br>

this one. This was my home. This is where I had a purpose. But it's not
real. It's just a computer generated fantasy. And I'm just an old man
who's trying to hide in it. Computer, shut this bloody thing off. It's

LAFORGE: Well you know, that's interesting because I was just thinking
that a lot of these systems haven't changed much in the last seventy
five years. This transporter is basically the same system we use on the
Enterprise. Subspace radio and sensors still operate under the same
basic principle. Impulse engine design hasn't changed much in the last
two hundred years. If it wasn't for all the structural damage, this
ship might still be in service today. <br>
SCOTT: Maybe so, but when they can build ships like your Enterprise,
who'd want to pilot an old bucket like this? <br>
LAFORGE: I don't know. If this ship were operational I bet she'd run
circles around the Enterprise at impulse speeds. Just because
something's old doesn't mean you throw it away. <br>
SCOTT: We used to have something called a dynamic mode converter. You
wouldn't have something like that on your Enterprise would you? <br>
LAFORGE: I haven't seen anything like that in a long time, but I bet I
might be able to come up with something similar. La Forge to
Enterprise.
La Forge to Enterprise, come in, please. <br>
SCOTT: Interference? <br>
LAFORGE: No, they're gone.

LAFORGE: No, we'd be picking up background radiation if they'd gone
down. <br>
SCOTT: There's another possibility. They could be inside the sphere. <br>
LAFORGE: Maybe. Whatever happened, we've got to find them. If we can
get these engines back online, we could track them with their impulse
ion trail. <br>
SCOTT: Are ye daft? The main drive assembly's shot, the inducers are
melted, and the power couplings are wrecked. We'd need a week just to
get started. But we don't have a week, so there's no sense in crying
about it. Come on, We'll see what we can do with your power converter.

show that the star is extremely unstable. It is experiencing severe
bursts of radiation and matter expulsions. <br>
PICARD: Then that would explain why they abandoned it. But if there's
no one still living there, how were we brought inside? <br>
DATA: I believe we triggered a series of automatic piloting beams
designed to guide ships into the sphere. <br>
WORF: Sir, Sensors show a large magnetic disturbance on the star's
surface. <br>
DATA: It is a solar flare, Captain. Magnitude twelve, class B. <br>
PICARD: Shields? <br>
WORF: Shields are up, but only at twenty three percent. <br>
DATA: The star has entered a period of increased activity. Sensors
indicate that the solar flares will continue to grow. In three hours,
our shields will no longer be sufficient to protect us, sir.

LAFORGE: What do you mean, where did I get that idea? It's in the
impulse engine specifications. <br>
SCOTT: Regulation forty two slash fifteen, pressure variances on IRC
tank storage? <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah. <br>
SCOTT: Forget it. I wrote it. A good engineer is always a wee bit
conservative, at least on paper. Just bypass the secondary cut-off
valve and boost the flow. It'll work. <br>
LAFORGE: Okay. <br>
SCOTT: If we've done our jobs properly, the engines should be coming
back online about now. <br>

PICARD: Mister Worf, can we use the phasers to open a hole in the
sphere? <br>
WORF: No, sir. The exterior shell is composed of carbon neutronium. Our
weapons would be ineffective. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, we have to find some way out of here. Begin
scanning for another hatch or portal that might still be open. <br>
DATA: The interior surface area is over ten to the sixteenth square
kilometres. It will take seven hours to completely scan the surface. <br>

SCOTT: The Enterprise ion trail leads right to this point. <br>
LAFORGE: It looks like some kind of doorway. <br>
SCOTT: I'll bet you two bottles of Scotch that they're inside the
sphere and that they went in right through that hatch. <br>
LAFORGE: No bet here. The question is how? <br>
SCOTT: Look at the momentum distribution of the ions. It would take an
impulse engine at full reverse to put out a signature like that. <br>
LAFORGE: So they didn't go in willingly. This looks like some kind of
communications array. <br>
SCOTT: Aye. We found hundreds of them when we did our initial survey
seventy five years ago. <br>
LAFORGE: Did you try hailing them? <br>
SCOTT: Aye. That was standard procedure at the time. We did it right
before we crashed. <br>
LAFORGE: Hailing is standard procedure today, too. Scotty, what if
those aren't communications arrays? What if they're access terminals
which are triggered by subspace signals on certain frequencies. <br>
SCOTT: Frequencies like our standard ship's hail. <br>
LAFORGE: Exactly. The Enterprise, when they saw that terminal, they
probably did the same thing you did seventy five years ago. Opened a
channel. Only this time they triggered something that activated that
hatch and pulled the ship inside the sphere. <br>
SCOTT: Very nice piece of reasoning, laddie. Nice indeed. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah. We could probably trigger the hatch ourselves, only we'd
get pulled in like they were. <br>
SCOTT: Maybe all we need to do is to get our foot in the door. We might
not be pulled inside when the hatch opens if we keep our distance from
the sphere. Say, half million kilometres. Then when the hatch starts to
close, we move in and we use the Jenolen to jam the hatch open, hoping
that the Enterprise will escape. <br>
LAFORGE: You can't be serious. That hatch is huge. It'll crush this
ship like an egg. <br>
SCOTT: Geordi, the shields will hold. Don't worry about that. I can get
a few extra gigawatts out of these babies. <br>
LAFORGE: Scotty, it's crazy. <br>
SCOTT: Geordi. I have spent my whole life trying to figure out crazy
ways of doing things. I'm telling you, as one engineer to another, I
can do this. <br>
LAFORGE: All right. Let's do it.
