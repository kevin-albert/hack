Captain's log, stardate 44932.3 The Enterprise is preparing to enter
the Mar Oscura, an unexplored dark matter nebula. Commander Data is
modifying several new photon torpedoes for an experiment designed to
elicit more information about this unusual phenomenon.

more than seven kilometres in diameter. Jenna? <br>
JENNA: Oh, er, six point eight kilometres. <br>
DATA: That should suffice. Is there something occupying your thoughts,
Jenna? You seem somewhat subdued today. <br>
JENNA: I bumped into Jeff again in the turbolift this morning. He asked
me to dinner. <br>
DATA: What was your response? <br>
JENNA: I told him I'd think about it. <br>
DATA: As you requested, I will now remind you of the reasons you
decided to end your relationship with Jeff. <br>
JENNA: I guess I asked for this. Go ahead. <br>
DATA: You objected to the fact that he seemed unwilling to set aside
sufficient time for you. You said he was unresponsive, that he never
did the little things. You disliked the sound he made when he ate his
soup. <br>
JENNA: Okay, okay. I remember. <br>
DATA: This is the third time I have refreshed your memory. Do you wish
to rescind our agreement? <br>
JENNA: No. No, it's for my own good. It's just so easy to forget. Hand
me the sequencer. <br>
DATA: Throughout history, many lovers have suffered the same
difficulty. Anne Boleyn was quite distressed that Henry the Eighth
preferred the company of his huntsmen over that of his wife. <br>
JENNA: Since when did you develop an interest in romantic historical
figures? <br>
DATA: Six weeks ago, when you and Jeff dissolved your relationship, I
saw an excellent opportunity to study that aspect of human intimacy. As
your friend, it is my responsibility to be supportive in times of need.
<br>
JENNA: That's very sweet, Data. <br>
DATA: Data to Bridge. We are ready </font></p>

O'BRIEN: That was wonderful. <br>
KEIKO: Thank you. <br>
(Miles and Keiko embrace) <br>
MILES: Really wonderful. <br>
DATA: Is anything wrong? <br>
JENNA: My tempo was way off. I felt like I was rushing through the
whole piece. <br>
DATA: I do not believe that is so. Your rhythmic control has improved
markedly. I heard no fluctuations during the performance. <br>
JENNA: Well, maybe, but I ruined the coda. I got confused with the
phrasing again. I kept breathing at the wrong times. <br>
DATA: The contrapuntal nature of the composition is most demanding. We
will give more attention to the rhythmic patterns at our next
rehearsal. However, I am quite certain the audience was oblivious to
such nuances. They seemed to enjoy the performance thoroughly. <br>
JENNA: Thank you, Data. You're very generous. <br>
(later, at a table) <br>
KEIKO: Every night, Miles leaves his socks on the floor. When we got
married, I made the mistake of picking them up a few times. Then I
realised, if I kept it up I'd be doing it the rest of my life. So I
stopped, figuring he'd get the point and do it himself. One night goes
by, two, a week, ten days. By now there's a pile of socks half a metre
high. <br>
O'BRIEN: Come on, it wasn't half a metre. <br>
KEIKO: After two weeks I couldn't stand it any more. I bundled them up
and put them in the cleaning processor. And I'm still doing it. <br>
O'BRIEN: And a very good job she does of it, too. <br>
JENNA: Keiko, you sound just like Data. He came over to my quarters the
other day to give me a music lesson, and he said the funniest thing.
How did you put it, about the mess? <br>
DATA: I believe I observed that you seem to have an aversion to
orderliness. But it was not intended as a humourous remark. <br>
JENNA: So, before we started, he gallantly offered to help me
straighten up. <br>
DATA: And a very good job of it I did of it, too. <br>

DATA: I am nearly finished compiling readings from our most recent
illuminatory burst. Dark matter density is nearly one order of
magnitude higher than in similar nebulae. Life forms here may have
developed in ways never before observed. <br>
RIKER: Interesting hypothesis. Are there any M-class planets we could
check out? <br>
DATA: Several, sir. The nearest is approximately three light hours from
our present position. <br>
PICARD: It's worth a look. We'll continue our survey along the way. </font></p>

Just my little brother and me, and mother. She was hopeless without a
replicator. We didn't care. <br>
DATA: Children often do not develop discerning palettes until well
beyond adolescence. <br>
JENNA: It's wasn't that. It's just that we felt so good being together,
you know, as a family. We didn't have much of that after my father
died. so those times were really special. I wish we were back there
now, you and I. <br>
DATA: The unidirectional nature of the time continuum makes that an
unlikely possibility. <br>
JENNA: That what I love about you, Data. You make me laugh. I don't
know why I keep falling for the wrong man. Why can't I fall for
somebody like you. You're perfect. <br>
DATA: That is not true. I have no human feelings. <br>
JENNA: But you give me so much. You spend time with me when I was
lonely, you encouraged me when I'm down. No man has ever been kinder to
me. Those are the things that matter. I'd better be going. With your
permission, Commander. <br>
DATA: Permission granted. <br>

GUINAN: Hello, Data. Would you like to try something new? It's a
concoction I heard about on Prakal Two. I think it's wonderful but I
need a second opinion. <br>
DATA: Eighty seven percent Saurian Brandy. Targ milk and Danisian mead
comprise the rest. There is an unusually high concentration of fructose
compounds and monosaccharides. <br>
GUINAN: Too sweet? Data, if I didn't know you better, I would say you
were a little preoccupied. <br>
DATA: Lieutenant D'Sora just gave me what could be considered a very
passionate kiss in the torpedo bay. <br>
GUINAN: Really? And? <br>
DATA: I was intrigued. Jenna seemed to be displaying genuine affection
for me. <br>
GUINAN: Well, what do you think of her, Data? <br>
DATA: I find her to be a competent officer. Highly motivated, though
somewhat lacking in her understanding of the theory underlying the
dilithium matrix application. <br>
GUINAN: I meant personally? <br>
DATA: I look forward to the time we spend together. <br>
GUINAN: Well, then it seems the next move is yours. What are you going
to do? <br>
DATA: I do not know. I have no experience in such matters. I require
advice. <br>
GUINAN: Don't look at me. No, no, Data, I simply mean that I can't give
you any advice here. It's not good to advise people about their first
love affairs. That's kind of something they have to figure out for
themselves. <br>
DATA: But I am not capable of love. <br>
GUINAN: Then it's going to be a very unique experience.

COMPUTER: Negative. <br>
LAFORGE: That's really strange. You know, to be on the safe side maybe
I should report a possible unauthorised entry to Security. <br>

LAFORGE: Sure, Data. <br>
DATA: Should I pursue a relationship with Lieutenant D'Sora? <br>
LAFORGE: I thought she and Jeff Arton <br>
DATA: They have discontinued their association. She has made the first
move in initiating a relationship with me. What should I do? <br>
LAFORGE: She's just coming out of a bad situation. You know, sometimes
it takes people a while, Data, but then, if they jump right into
another relationship, you see, that can be trouble, unless, of course,
she's really ready, and then I guess it depends on whether or not
you're really serious. This can be a little complicated. Listen, my
advice is ask somebody else for advice. At least someone who's got more
experience at giving advice.

just some experiment you're running, Data. Jenna is a living, breathing
person with needs and feelings that have to be considered. <br>
DATA: Then you do not believe I should pursue this any further. <br>
TROI: I didn't say that. I just want you to be aware that this is
unlike any other more casual relationship that you've attempted. <br>
DATA: I have studied much human literature on the subject of love and
romantic liaisons. There are many role models for me to emulate. <br>
TROI: Ultimately, Jenna will care for you for what you are, not what
you imitate out of a book. <br>

RIKER: Data, when you get involved with another person, there are
always risks of disappointment, of getting hurt. <br>
DATA: I cannot be hurt. But she can. <br>
RIKER: Jenna knows that and she has obviously decided to take the
chance. Data, when it really works between two people, it's not like
anything you've ever experienced. The rewards are far beyond simple
friendship. <br>

JENNA: They're lovely. Come in. What are they? <br>
DATA: A variety of crystilia. Their fragrance is an evolutionary
response to the acrid nature of the atmosphere on Telemarius Four. <br>
JENNA: You silver-tongued devil. Why don't I find a place to put these.
Which won't be that easy. Ah. <br>
(she takes some old flowers out of a vase and puts the new ones in
their place) <br>

disorder. <br>
JENNA: I know. I'm hopeless. There. (on the table) They're beautiful,
Data. It's really sweet of you. <br>
DATA: Commander Riker suggested this particular flower. He said it had
worked for him in the past. <br>
(Data holds out his arms for an embrace) <br>
JENNA: You didn't talk to the entire ship about us. <br>
DATA: No. In actuality, less than one percent of the Enterprise crew
was involved. It was necessary to balance theory with
experiential referents. Both are required for a programme of this
nature. Computer, decrease illumination level by one third standard
lux. <br>
(he clears the sofa then puts out an arm. She is meant to snuggle into
it) <br>
JENNA: This is all part of a programme? <br>
DATA: Yes. One which I have just created for romantic relationships. <br>
JENNA: So I'm just a small variable in one of your new computational
environments? <br>
DATA: You are much more than that, Jenna. I have written a subroutine
specifically for you. A
programme within the programme.
I have devoted a considerable share of my internal resources to its
development. <br>

necessarily the best response to a gift. <br>
DATA: Perhaps if I looked for a suitable place to display it? <br>
JENNA: Much better. <br>
DATA: The ambient light in this location accentuates its contours.
However, a gift should not necessarily be placed according to aesthetic
criteria. A more central location will carry added meaning. <br>

this nebula. After I have made further analysis, I may be able to
adjust the ship's sensors to locate and identify the anomaly. <br>

continue the investigation outside the nebula. <br>

unexplained events has now resulted in the death of a crewmember, but
it appears that Mister Data may have an explanation. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: During the last occurrence, I was able to
confirm one of my hypotheses. The unusual preponderance of dark matter
in this nebula is causing small gaps in the fabric of normal space. As
the Enterprise moves through this nebula, it is colliding with these
deformations. <br>
LAFORGE: So every time we hit one, part of the ship momentarily phases
out of normal space. <br>
DATA: Or when one of them hits us. My readings suggest that the
deformations themselves are in motion. <br>
RIKER: It's a good thing one of these pockets didn't pass through a
photon torpedo casing or the matter-antimatter containment pods. <br>
PICARD: The question is, how do we get out? Mister Data, could you
reconfigure the sensors to detect these anomalies? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir, but only at extremely close range. Even at minimal
speed, it would be almost impossible to manoeuvre the Enterprise
quickly enough to avoid them. <br>
WORF: A shuttlecraft is more manoeuvrable. <br>
RIKER: He's right. If we could position the shuttlecraft far enough in
front of the Enterprise, it could detect the pockets and allow us
enough time to manoeuvre out of the way. <br>
LAFORGE: We could give the shuttle control of our navigational systems.
That way, the corresponding manoeuvres would be virtually
instantaneous. <br>
PICARD: Make it so.

PICARD: I'm going to pilot the shuttle. <br>
RIKER: Captain, it's my duty as First Officer to safeguard the lives on
this ship, including yours. The Enterprise can't afford to lose you,
sir. Certainly not in this situation. <br>

to pilot the shuttle. It's my ship, Will. I've got to do this. <br>
