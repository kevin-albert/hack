signal. <br>
PICARD: This is Captain Picard aboard the Starfleet vessel Enterprise.
Please do us the honour of visiting our vessel. <br>
(Five people beam aboard. One rolls out a red carpet, then stands aside
as an imposing man beams in) <br>
LUTAN: I am Lutan. <br>
PICARD: Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome aboard. These are my officers.
My second in command, Commander William Riker. Ship's Counsellor,
Deanna Troi. And my Security Officer, Lieutenant Natasha Yar. <br>
LUTAN: A woman? Your Chief of Security? <br>
PICARD: Yes, Lutan, that is her expertise. <br>
LUTAN: I am honoured to meet your officers. This is my Secondary,
Hagon. A sample of the vaccine. <br>

Picard) <br>

HAGON: Out of my way, woman. <br>
(Tasha does a neat manoeuvre which takes the box and leaves Hagon face
down on the floor) <br>
LUTAN: How interesting. May we prove as surprising to you. <br>
TROI: If I may suggest, sir, no apology. In their view, it would weaken
us. <br>
TASHA: Nothing concealed, Captain. Would you care to accept it? <br>
LUTAN: Unless you care to examine it further. <br>
PICARD: Absolutely not. This vaccine sample is a gift of life and we
are honoured at receiving it. Would you do us the additional honour of
now letting us entertain you?
LUTAN: Yes, yes. Please prepare it. We shall join you shortly. <br>

PICARD: Lutan, we are aware of many of your planet's achievements, and
its unique similarity to an ancient Earth culture we all
admire. On behalf of the Federation, therefore, I would like to present
this token of our gratitude and friendship. From China's Sung Dynasty,
Fourteenth Century. <br>
DATA: Thirteenth Century, sir. <br>
PICARD: Ah, yes, indeed. <br>
LUTAN: A most thoughtful gift. We are pleased. We of Ligon have been
apprehensive about strangers. We are not technologically advanced as
you, yet we possess something you do not. A vaccine which has been
found to be an effective antidote to your dreaded Anchilles fever. If
you respect our customs and if we see that respect, we will be friends.
And we will make the antidote available to all who need it. <br>
PICARD: If you require respect from us, I am sure that you will see it.
<br>
LUTAN: Surrounded by such friendship, I feel no need for my guards. I
will return shortly. Prepare to transport me then. <br>
(The four guards leave) <br>
PICARD: If there is something else, any further courtesy? <br>
LUTAN: Would it possible to see one of your wondrous holodecks? We have
heard how they are used to train your officers. <br>
PICARD: And used for many other things too. Commander Riker, perhaps
you and Counsellor Troi will demonstrate. <br>
LUTAN: Would it be possible for Lieutenant Yar to do so, Captain? Some
demonstration of defence training? <br>
RIKER: We've noticed you're intrigued with her having security
responsibilities. But these things are not at all unusual with us. <br>
HAGON: With us, it is the duty of women only to own the land, and the
duty of men to protect and rule it. <br>
TROI: Much the same has happened in human history too. <br>
TASHA: I'd like to do it, sir. As a sign of respect, perhaps. <br>

TASHA: It's not a real person, Lutan. It has no life. Everything it
does is controlled by computer. Who am I? Do you hear me? <br>

TASHA: But it will feel real when it hits you. <br>

LUTAN: Thank you, Lieutenant. How very enlightening. <br>
TASHA: Aikido, vanish. I could create two, even three, but really one

exactly how to defeat you. <br>

torpedoes activated, sir. <br>
PICARD: What comm. contact have we had with them? <br>
DATA: With their orbital control station, sir. <br>
PICARD: Make contact there and on all hailing frequencies. This is the
Enterprise to Lutan and the Ligonian government. You have committed an
unfriendly act. We insist that you reply immediately. <br>
RIKER: Photon torpedoes ready, sir. <br>
PICARD: Set them for a display blast a thousand metres short of the
planet's surface. <br>
RIKER: Set. <br>
PICARD: Fire. <br>
RIKER: Do we know the source of their transporter beam? <br>
LAFORGE: Our own transporter people have tried to trace it, sir, but to
no effect. <br>
DATA: It reads similar to early Starfleet efforts but uses the
Heglenian shift to convert matter and energy in different. (turns)
Which is actually not important at this time. <br>
PICARD: This is Captain Picard of the Enterprise with a message to
Lutan, whom I have so far acknowledged as a friend. But you have now
committed what our laws regard as an attack upon us. Since you have
visited our vessel, you most certainly know the
power of it. We insist that you reply to this message. Opinion,
Counsellor. Will they injure Lieutenant Yar? <br>
TROI: I believe not, sir. They seem mainly curious. In the case of
Lutan, however, I did feel other needs. <br>
RIKER: What kind of needs? <br>
TROI: Some sexual attraction from all the males. Lieutenant Yar is
physically very attractive. But with Lutan I felt something else.
Something more like avarice or ambition. <br>
PICARD: Other comments? <br>
DATA: If I may, sir. One of the things about them in the briefing
studies was their respect for patience. <br>
RIKER: Strongly emphasized. And you can see it in the precise,
ritualistic way they do things. I'm worried about Lieutenant Yar too,
sir, but maybe we should sit and wait them out. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stardate 41235.32. I am concerned. Over a full day
of waiting with no response from Lutan. We are now testing whether they
are aware of our sensors probing them. So far, we believe we have
pinpointed Lutan's government compound.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: The vaccine, sir. <br>
PICARD: Yes, Doctor? <br>
CRUSHER: The vaccine. I'm a physician, I've seen death, but not on the
scale this could mean. <br>
PICARD: You were testing if you can replicate the vaccine. <br>
CRUSHER: And we can't. The sample works fine when used as an injection,
but it becomes unstable when we try to replicate it. You
must get the vaccine from the planet, Captain. As much as you can.
Immediately. <br>
PICARD: I'm aware of that, Doctor. <br>
CRUSHER: You've never had to watch a patient die from this disease. <br>
PICARD: That's true. But I have seen my share of death. <br>
CRUSHER: Damn. Where are the calluses we doctors are supposed to grow
over our feelings? <br>
PICARD: Perhaps the good ones never get them. <br>
CRUSHER: May I speak about my son, Wesley? <br>
PICARD: What? Oh, yes. Alright. <br>
CRUSHER: He seems quite interested in starship operations. And speaking
as a mother, of course, he seems quite knowledgeable. <br>
PICARD: Well, yes, speaking as a mother. <br>
CRUSHER: He's on the turbolift. You'll remember you ordered him to stay
off of the Bridge. <br>

RIKER: No? <br>
PICARD: Why don't you sit at Ops next to Lieutenant La Forge. <br>
WESLEY: Sir? <br>
LAFORGE: Sir? <br>
PICARD: Is the whole ship deaf?! Sit down over there, young man.
Temporarily. <br>
TROI: Captain, we have more information from the briefing studies on
Ligon. <br>
PICARD: Excuse me. Doctor Crusher, some of this may interest you. Lets
hear the analysis. <br>
DATA: It is a highly structured society in which people live by strict
codes of honour. For example, what Lutan did is similar to what certain
American Indians once did called counting coup. That's from an obscure
language called French. Counting coup <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, the French language for centuries on Earth
represented civilisation. <br>
DATA: Indeed? But surely, sir <br>
RIKER: I suggest you drop it, Mister Data. <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. Counting coup could be as simple as touching an enemy
with a stick in battle, or taking something from him and escaping. It
was considered extremely heroic. <br>
RIKER: And under these circumstances Lutan considers himself heroic,
risking literally everything in the face of our superior power. <br>
TROI: And it fits Lutan's personality profile as well. He has an
abnormally high need for achievement. Self image to him is a function
of what he thinks he's achieved. Those who set their standards too high
can kill to meet them. <br>
CRUSHER: Why Tasha? <br>
TROI: As a Starfleet Security Officer, she may have represented his
riskiest prize. <br>
DATA: Transmission from the planet surface, sir, Main viewer on. <br>
PICARD: Well, Lutan, what do you want? <br>
LUTAN [on viewscreen]: You will display your image, please. <br>
PICARD: What is required is an image of Lieutenant Yar, well and <br>
LUTAN [on viewscreen]: Are you making demands, Captain? <br>
TROI: Sir. According to the Ligon Code of Honour, Lutan has done what
he set out to do, achieve recognition for being daring and bold. <br>
RIKER: We've studied this in some depth now, sir. The proper thing for
you to do now is to ask to get Tasha back. <br>
PICARD: Ask for her? <br>
DATA: Politely, Captain. <br>
PICARD: And now, Lutan, you have boldly taken Lieutenant Yar from us,
and we ask that you now please return her. <br>
LUTAN [on viewscreen]: Then come visit us, Captain, and we will return
her to you. <br>
(a little later) <br>
TROI: Commander. <br>
RIKER: Commander? That's quite formal. <br>
TROI: So is this request, sir. We believe it would be preferable if the
Captain led this away party. <br>
DATA: Agreed, sir. Their customs concerning guests make it much
preferable. <br>
RIKER: And I'm very much against that idea. Lutan is clearly a liar,
and devious. Counsellor Troi has admitted she believes he's capable of
killing. It is my duty to keep the Captain from danger, sir. <br>
DATA: Except that Ligonian custom makes it clear that a visiting leader
becomes an honoured guest. Not us, not second in command, him. <br>
TROI: And the custom requires that Lutan should die rather than violate
that. <br>
RIKER: Yes, it seems reasonable put that way. But I warn you, if you
get hurt, I'll put you on report, Captain.

have arranged in your honour. <br>
PICARD: I'd like to see her now. <br>
LUTAN: Bring Lieutenant Yar. I find it odd, Captain, that a man of your
experience has such difficulty in understanding ordinary politeness. <br>
PICARD: Such as the politeness of saying please before abducting
someone? <br>
LUTAN: The expression please is used only when requesting the person
back. <br>

are willing to ask for Lieutenant Yar's return tonight in front of all,
honour will be satisfied. <br>

you. And now, according with the customs of your ancestors, whom we
honour and respect, I am here in peace to ask for the return of
Lieutenant Yar. <br>
LUTAN: Well spoken. There are those among my equals in this gathering
who were wary of my approaching the Federation. I am proud to have
taken this first step towards a treaty, and proud that we have
something of great value to offer you, a priceless life-giving vaccine.
The abduction I have done according to our custom, for all to see. Your
conduct in this matter has been beyond exemplary, Captain Picard, but
now that the moment has come, I find I cannot part with her. <br>
(General consternation!) <br>
PICARD: You speak of a code of honour, but what you are saying now,
according to our customs, is called an act of war. <br>
LUTAN: This is not an act of war, but of love. I want Lieutenant Yar to
become my First One. <br>

DATA: Which makes it important to know which of these weapons are to be
used. <br>
PICARD: And that won't be known until combat begins. You're right,
Data. It does sound like a joke. With the power of the Enterprise, we
could overwhelm this place easily, just take what we want. <br>
DATA: I may not understand human humour, sir, but I am a Starfleet
Academy graduate. <br>
PICARD: Which means, of course <br>
DATA: understanding the Prime Directive, sir. <br>
PICARD: That is, ironically, what this is about. By our standards, the
customs here, their code of honour, is the same kind of pompous,
strutting charades that endangered our own species a few centuries ago.
We evolved out of it because no one else imposed their own. I'm sorry,
this is becoming a speech. <br>
TROI: You're the Captain, sir. You're entitled. <br>
PICARD: Not entitled to ramble on about something everyone knows. Carry
on.

point to it. You've accepted the challenge and there is nothing further
to say. <br>
TASHA: I think you should know that there is no physical training
anywhere that matches Starfleet, especially its security people. <br>
YAREENA: And you should know that even though these contests are rare,
we have a tradition of making ourselves capable of them. <br>
TASHA: Yareena, my acceptance had nothing to do with Lutan. <br>
YAREENA: It has everything to do with Lutan. Lutan wants you to be his
First One. <br>
TASHA: Impossible, Yareena. I am a career Starfleet officer. <br>
YAREENA: How could you not love him? Every woman loves him. <br>
TASHA: I fight for the vaccine, That's the truth. <br>
YAREENA: The truth is I will kill you if I can. And believe me, I can.
There is nothing else to say. <br>
TASHA: In my world, it's a greater honour to refuse <br>
YAREENA: You are on our world!

with you to Ligon to be of help. <br>
PICARD: Then help me, please. What is a way out of this? <br>
TROI: With the vaccine? None. <br>
(Geordi and Data enter) <br>
LAFORGE: The weapons in that room, Captain, are surprisingly flexible,
durable, and deadly. <br>
DATA: And light, as if they were made for women to use. <br>
LAFORGE: Some of them still have traces of blood and poison. <br>
PICARD: Poison? <br>
LAFORGE: Alkaloid base. Lethal. <br>
PICARD: What about those lengths of metal in the yard outside? <br>
DATA: Uncertain, sir. However, joined together they would make a
rectangle or square enclosing one hundred twenty one square metres. If
put end to end vertically, they would make a pole forty four metres
high, or two of twenty two. <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Data. <br>
DATA: You're welcome, sir. <br>
(Tasha enters) <br>
TASHA: She won't budge. She loves him, without reservation. And she
thinks I love him too. <br>
DATA: Most interesting. Do you? <br>
TASHA: Of course I don't, Data. As Troi pointed out to me, I'm
attracted to him but that is entirely different. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Captain. <br>
PICARD: Go ahead, Riker. We're alone. <br>
RIKER [OC]: We're fine tuned enough to see your hosts gathering in the
open area outside, sir. Three of them are heading for your location. <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Number One. Lieutenant, do you still feel that you
want to go through with this challenge? Do you judge your condition
good? <br>
TASHA: I judge it excellent, sir. <br>
(Hagon enters, followed by two guards carrying boxes) <br>
HAGON: Your weapons, Lieutenant Yar. You may choose your size. <br>
(She opens a box containing a glove with metal spikes and a curved
blade) <br>
LAFORGE: Tasha, don't touch the spines. They're poisoned. If you're not
careful, you could kill yourself. <br>
TASHA: These I understand. <br>

CRUSHER: Captain's orders too. <br>

(Yareena enters)&nbsp;<br>
HAGON: I speak for Lutan. The rules are known. Let combat continue
until there is a victor. It will not be interrupted. <br>
(Yareena goes on the offensive straight away. Tasha pushes her weapon
away and it hits one of the vertical laser beams. It flies off
Yareena's hand into the lap of a spectator)<br>
LUTAN: Combatants, hold your positions. Return the weapon. <br>
(The spectator dies of his wound and is dragged away. Yareena is given
the glove back and she returns to the business of trying to kill Tasha.
Tasha manages to make Yareena loose her balance) <br>
HAGON: Careful, Yareena. <br>

blow on Yareena's back. Then she lies across the body and the two are
