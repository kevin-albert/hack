fourteen and fifteen. Your transporter
room assignment has been changed. Report to transporter room three. <br>
TROI: Captain. We're still behind schedule on decks seven and eight.
Shall I tell Arkaria Base there'll be a delay? <br>
PICARD: No. Open up the transporters in Cargo bay two and divert
everyone from deck seven to there. That should put it back on track. <br>
TROI: Right. <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: All beta shift Engineering personnel are requested to
report to main Engineering prior to disembarking. <br>
CRUSHER: Captain. Arkaria Base does not have the medical storage units
I have requested. I have seven living tissue samples that won't survive
the baryon sweep anymore than you or I would. I've tried to reason with
them, but <br>
PICARD: All right, all right. Have Commander LaForge transport a stasis
unit from the astrophysics lab. You should be able to convert it to
store tissue samples. <br>
CRUSHER: Thank you, Captain. <br>
CREWWOMAN [OC]: All science personnel. Please check in with your
section chief for station-side duty assignments. <br>
RIKER: Captain. (comes out of turbolift) I was just heading for deck
seven. I've put the auto-shutdown sequence on hold until we get back on
schedule. <br>
PICARD: Oh, I think we can resume the sequence. Counsellor Troi is
taking care of the situation on deck seven. <br>

PICARD: Yes, it has. <br>
DATA: However, a change of routine is often invigorating and can be a
welcome diversion after a long assignment. <br>
PICARD: Exactly. <br>
DATA: I understand that Arkaria has some very interesting weather
patterns. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, are you all right? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. I am attempting to fill a silent moment with
non-relevant conversation. <br>
PICARD: Small talk. <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. I have found that humans often use small talk during
awkward moments. Therefore, I have written a new subroutine for that
purpose. How did I do? <br>
PICARD: Perhaps it was a little too non-relevant. But if you really are
interested in small talk, then you should keep your eye on Commander
Hutchinson at the reception this afternoon. He's a master. <br>

WORF: The computer needs your authorisation to disable command
functions during the baryon sweep. <br>
PICARD: Are we ready, Commander La Forge? <br>
LAFORGE: Almost. I've requested two additional field diverters. One for
the computer core and one for the Bridge. They haven't been installed
yet. <br>
PICARD: Additional units? <br>
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. We've logged in five years more warp hours than most
ships do in ten, so our baryon particle levels are high. I'm a little
concerned that when the Remmler Array starts to sweep the ship it'll
have to use a stronger beam than normal in order to get rid of all the
radiation. <br>
PICARD: And that might overload the field diverters protecting our key
systems. How long until the new ones are in place? <br>
LAFORGE: I'd say about twenty minutes. <br>
PICARD: Very well. Computer, disable all command functions in thirty
minutes. Authorisation, Picard gamma six zero seven three. <br>

Orton. <br>

CRUSHER: It's good to see you again. <br>
HUTCH: It's been far too long. What is it, four years? Now I want to
hear everything that happened after you left Starfleet Medical. And I
have so much to tell you. Oh, that must be Commander Riker. Excuse me. <br>
CRUSHER: Of course. <br>

RIKER: I must be. <br>
HUTCH: Calvin Hutchinson. Call me Hutch. Calvin, awful name, I've never
forgiven my parents. As soon as I saw you, I knew you had to be the
Enterprise's First Officer. <br>
RIKER: Oh? <br>
HUTCH: Of course. Your reputation proceeds you. Flashing blue eyes,
square jaw. Quite the ladies man I hear. Now don't be modest, Will. May
I call you Will? <br>

RIKER: Sure. <br>
HUTCH: I also hear that you're a musician. I certainly hope you'll play
something for us. It's not often we get to entertain the command crew
of the flagship. Oh, and speaking of command. Hello, Captain Picard. <br>
PICARD: Commander. <br>
HUTCH: I was just telling your First Officer what a real pleasure it is
to have all of you here. So, how are you anyway? <br>
PICARD: Very well, thank you. <br>
(our focus moves from Hutch to Data) <br>
DATA: It is very good to see you both again. Beverly. May I call you
Beverly? Beverly, have you noticed that the mean temperature here on
Arkaria is slightly higher normal for human comfort levels? I have
found that humans prefer a body temperature of twenty one degrees
Celsius in order to operate most efficiently. However, there are
several cultures who actually prefer that their body temperature is
identical to the temperature of the room in which they are standing.
The Sheliak, for example. <br>
HUTCH: I'm telling you, you have never seen anything like this. There
were thousands of these creatures. The whole northern sky turned dark.

PICARD: Oh, er, Geordi, Deanna. I don't think you've met our host. This
is Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Counsellor Deanna Troi. This
is Commander Hutchinson. <br>
HUTCH: Oh, please, call me Hutch. <br>
TROI: Hello. <br>
HUTCH: I was just telling your captain about some of the fascinating
sights here on Arkaria. Either of you interested in ornithology? <br>
TROI: Er, well. <br>
HUTCH: The mating habits of the Arkarian horn fowl are quite
interesting. If the weather were better, we could take horses to the
southern promontory and visit the nesting grounds. <br>
PICARD: Horses? <br>
HUTCH: Yes. We have a network of trails through the plains.
Unfortunately, it's not very pleasant right now. Cold, muddy. Not a
soul for kilometres. <br>
PICARD: Sounds perfect. Mister La Forge, how long before the baryon
sweep begins on the Enterprise? <br>
LAFORGE: About twenty five minutes, sir. <br>
PICARD: Then I have enough time to back to the ship and get my saddle. <br>
TROI: Your saddle? <br>
PICARD: Yes. A saddle is a very personal thing. It has to be broken in,
used, cared for. <br>
LAFORGE: You keep a saddle on board the Enterprise? <br>
PICARD: Oh yes, yes. I never know when I'll have the opportunity to
ride. <br>
TROI: I see. <br>
PICARD: It's perfectly normal. Most serious riders do have their own
saddles. <br>
TROI: Of course. <br>

host, Commander Hutchinson. Call him Hutch. Lieutenant Commander Data,
our second officer. <br>
HUTCH: A pleasure. <br>

you on your choice of colours here. <br>
HUTCH: Oh, you really think so? It wasn't easy making a final decision,
let me tell you. <br>
DATA: I can well imagine. The light in this room would make colour
selection exceptionally problematic. <br>
HUTCH: Precisely. <br>

(Picard sets out with Worf's crossbow) <br>

Orton or the waiter) <br>
CRUSHER: (sotto) We're almost ready. When we set the visor to emit the

to discuss the situation. <br>
