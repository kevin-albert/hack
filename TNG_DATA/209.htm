Captain's log, stardate 45349.1. The Enterprise is on its way to
Penthara Four, where a type C asteroid has struck an unpopulated
continent. The resulting dust cloud could very well create a phenomenon
not unlike the nuclear winters of twenty first century Earth. Commander
La Forge has begun work on a plan that would counteract the
devastation.

already indicating climatic changes, Commander. <br>
RIKER: What kind of drop can we expect? <br>
DATA: If the Pentharan spheral forecasts are correct, ten to twelve
degrees Celsius within the first ten days. <br>
LAFORGE: If it continues like that, their entire ecosystem will be shot
to hell. <br>
RIKER: And I doubt they're prepared to cope with the kind of cold
that's coming. <br>

RIKER [OC]: Right away, sir. <br>
PICARD: Are you certain, Mister Worf? <br>
WORF: There was a space-time distortion, sir, and there is something
back there. We passed within three hundred kilometres of it. <br>
PICARD: It's too close to be a coincidence. Mister La Forge? <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: Yes, Captain? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Ensign, bring the ship about. Let's take a
look at Mister Worf's distortion. <br>
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. <br>
RIKER: Mister Worf's what? <br>
PICARD: The Lieutenant's sensors detected a temporal distortion almost
in our current course. There's a small object back there that wasn't
there a few moments ago. <br>
WORF: The object is fifty kilometres ahead, sir. <br>
PICARD: Full stop, Ensign. <br>
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: On screen. <br>
RIKER: Dimensions, Worf? <br>
WORF: Approximately five metres in length, sir. <br>
PICARD: Lifesigns? <br>
WORF: No signs of any kind. Our sensors do not penetrate the hull. <br>
PICARD: Try hailing it. <br>
WORF: That's odd. <br>
RIKER: What's odd? <br>
WORF: We've received a response, sir, but <br>
PICARD: Yes, Mister Worf? <br>
WORF: They want you to move over, sir. <br>
PICARD: Reply that the Enterprise isn't going anywhere, Lieutenant. <br>
WORF: Not the Enterprise, Captain. You. <br>
PICARD: What are you trying to tell me? <br>
(and as Picard walks back towards Worf a figure appears where he was
standing)
<br>
RASMUSSEN: Oops. Excuse me, Captain, but you were standing right where
I needed to be. <br>
PICARD: Who are you? <br>
RASMUSSEN: Rasmussen's the name, sir. Professor Berlinghoff Rasmussen.
Ah, this is wonderful. Actually, quite a bit larger than I thought. <br>
PICARD: Really? <br>
RASMUSSEN: Where I come from, every historian knows the bridge of old
1701D. <br>
PICARD: Where exactly do you come from? <br>
RASMUSSEN: Why, Earth. Late twenty sixth century Earth, to be exact.
I've travelled back nearly three hundred years just to find you.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(the lanky man is peering at a book on a stand -
Shakespeare I presume) <br>
PICARD: Exactly what kind of historian are you? <br>
RASMUSSEN: My focus is on the twenty second through the twenty fourth
centuries. Early interstellar history. You know, it was always believed
this was on your desk, not here. Fascinating. Don't move it on my
account. <br>
PICARD: You can't expect me to believe that the layout of my ready room
can possibly be of interest to future historians. <br>
RASMUSSEN: No less so than your legendary modesty, Captain. If I could
describe to you what a thrill it is to be here. (points at painting)
This is the original. <br>
PICARD: You flatter me Professor, but I can't help but wonder what
could possibly have caused you to select me as the subject of your
study. Even in this decade, there are far wiser and more experienced
humans in and out of Starfleet. <br>
RASMUSSEN: I'd love to tell you, Picard. I really would, but try and
imagine what a young Caesar might have done differently had someone had
given him a hint of what lay ahead, or if Lincoln had been coerced into
changing his theatre plans. I truly wish I could be more specific on
why you were selected, but I'm afraid the exchange of information will
have to flow in one direction only. (paces out the room) Five, six,
seven metres. Ha! I was right.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: Why now? <br>
LAFORGE: Right. If you've came back to study us, to study the captain,
why would you pick today? Why not a year ago or a year from now? <br>
RASMUSSEN: Oh, I picked the right day all right. Just wait, you'll see.
Do you always sit there, on that side of the table? <br>
WORF: Usually. Why? <br>
RASMUSSEN: It's not important. <br>
RIKER: Professor, at what point does time travel become a tool for
historians? <br>
RASMUSSEN: Now, now, Commander, you know better than that. I've studied
a great deal about your century, including the fact that you're all
quite aware of the dangers of anyone altering the past, and that's
exactly what I'd be doing if I were to divulge information like that. <br>
CRUSHER: Telurian plague. <br>
RASMUSSEN: I beg your pardon? <br>
CRUSHER: The telurian plague. Was it cured? I mean, did they find the
cure by your century? Oh, it can't do any harm to ask that. <br>
PICARD: I realise that it's difficult, but we must keep to ourselves
questions regarding the future. Go on, Professor. <br>
RASMUSSEN: I'll be preparing questionnaires for each of you. Please
complete them at your convenience. If you're concerned about a possible
breach of security, I'm sure your Captain can make a determination. And
thank you in advance for curbing your curiosity. <br>
LAFORGE: If I hand my assignment in on time, can I get a glimpse into
next week's poker game? <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, would you escort the Professor to his quarters. <br>
DATA: This way, sir. <br>
(Data and Rasmussen leave) <br>
RIKER: What did he mean, he picked the right day? <br>
PICARD: You know everything I do, Will. <br>
RIKER: Deanna? <br>
TROI: It's hard to tell, but he is holding something back. <br>
CRUSHER: Of course he is. All the things he could tell us. All the
things he would like to tell us. <br>
TROI: It might be that, I don't know. <br>
RIKER: What if he's an imposter? God knows we've seen enough of them. <br>
PICARD: He is human. The medical scans have proved that, right, Doctor?
<br>
CRUSHER: He's human, all right. <br>
PICARD: And there was a temporal distortion back there, correct Mister
Worf? <br>
WORF: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: And no one can deny that ship of his is unlike anything we've
ever seen before. <br>
LAFORGE: The hull is made of some kind of plasticised tritanium mesh.
We've nothing like it on record, at least not till now. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, I do appreciate your caution. I share it. Bring
his vessel into the shuttlebay. Place it under guard. <br>
WORF: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: I realise that this visit is going to be difficult for some of
us, but I've examined his credentials, and everything seems to be in
order, so I think we should extend to him every courtesy. <br>
WORF: Including questionnaires? <br>
PICARD: Including questionnaires, Mister Worf.

or not I am still alive in the twenty sixth century? <br>
(Rasmussen washes his hands and then holds them out for a towel. Data
obliges) <br>

PICARD: We've located three underground pockets of carbon dioxide,
here, here and here. Our drilling phasers can release enough of the gas
to form an envelope which would temporarily hold in the heat of the
sun. <br>
MOSELEY: We've spend years, decades, trying to avoid anything that
would lead to a greenhouse effect and now here we are about to create
one on purpose. <br>
LAFORGE: Less than twenty percent of your normal sunlight is getting
through that dust, Doctor. If we can hold enough heat in with the CO2,
that should give the planet time to mend itself. <br>
WOMAN: Excuse me, Doctor Moseley. <br>
MOSELEY: What now? <br>
WOMAN: New Seattle's reporting a cloud depth of twelve kilometres. Two

be painless. Please try and complete them by tomorrow. <br>

he does it) <br>
WORF: Tomorrow? <br>
RIKER: No problem, Professor. <br>
RASMUSSEN: You're all very calm. <br>
RIKER: Is there some reason we shouldn't be? <br>
RASMUSSEN: History always records where people were, what they were
doing, when important events took place. But it rarely remembers their
activities say, a week before, or a day or even an hour. <br>
WORF: Are you suggesting that an important event is imminent? <br>
RASMUSSEN: I didn't say that, did I? Please, just go on doing what you
were doing and pretend I'm not here. <br>
RIKER: Why is there no record of other future historians travelling
back to witness important events? <br>
RASMUSSEN: We're obviously very careful. As a matter of fact, a
colleague and I recently paid a call on a twenty second century vessel.
<br>
CRUSHER: They hadn't perfected quarantine fields. You probably saw some
surgical masks and gloves. <br>
RASMUSSEN: Isn't it fascinating how everyone has different interests
when it comes to history. Different perspectives on progress. <br>
(Rasmussen opens a ring and looks inside) <br>
RIKER: Would you mind telling me what that is? <br>
RASMUSSEN: Just checking the time. No problem. <br>
RIKER: Is something important supposed to be happening here? <br>
RASMUSSEN: No, it's nothing, nothing. What about you, Commander? What
do you see as the most important example of progress in the last two
hundred years? <br>
RIKER: I suppose the warp coil. Before there was warp drive, humans
were confined to a single sector of the galaxy. <br>
RASMUSSEN: Spoken like the consummate explorer. <br>
RIKER: What is going on? Are you expecting someone? <br>
WORF: Phasers. <br>
RASMUSSEN: I beg your pardon? <br>
WORF: There were no phasers in the 22nd century. <br>
RASMUSSEN: Ah, you see, Doctor? Our Klingon friend is a perfect example
of what I was trying to tell you. He views history through the eyes of
a hunter, a warrior. His passion lies in the perfection of the tools of
violence. How delightfully primitive.

punch. <br>

LAFORGE: Couldn't be better. Our scans were all clear and Moseley says
there hasn't been so much as a quiver down there in well over a
century. <br>

Captain. <br>
PICARD: Is La Forge still down there? <br>
WORF: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: Find him. <br>
RIKER: We've also got some volcanic activity. Pretty severe. <br>
PICARD: Magnify. <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge here, Captain. Moseley and I are on our way back
to his lab. <br>
PICARD: Are you all right? <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: We're okay, but those were pretty big, sir. If this was
Earth, I'd say around an eight or an eight five on the Richter Scale.
We're starting to see some volcanic plumes, Captain. <br>
WORF: Two more eruptions, sir. <br>
DATA: It is likely that we overestimated the geologic stability around
the CO2 pockets, Captain. <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: We're in the lab, sir. <br>
PICARD: On screen. <br>
MOSELEY [on viewscreen]: We're fairly well quake-proof down here,
Picard. It's the volcanic dust I'm worried about. <br>
PICARD: What about the dust? <br>
LAFORGE: The ash the volcanoes are throwing into the atmosphere is
going to compound the existing problem. In a matter of days, there'll
be no sunlight getting through those clouds. <br>
MOSELEY [on viewscreen]: No amount of CO2 will help us then. <br>
RIKER: Captain, take a look at this. (at science two) These are the
coordinates of the eruptions, and these are the coordinates of the
phaser drilling sites. <br>
PICARD: The mantle is collapsing where the pressure was released. <br>
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Captain, Doctor Moseley and I have a couple of
ideas, but it's going to take some time to sort out. <br>
PICARD: Sort them out, Commander. <br>
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Aye, sir. <br>
RIKER: We came here to help these people. <br>
PICARD: And look what we've done.

RASMUSSEN: What in God's name is that? <br>
DATA: Music, Professor. <br>
RASMUSSEN: Music? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. Mozart's Jupiter symphony in C major, Bach's
Brandenburg Concerto number three, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, second

RASMUSSEN: Do you think you could thin it out a bit? <br>
DATA: Computer, eliminate programme one. Computer, eliminate programme

programme three. Computer, half volume. <br>
RASMUSSEN: How the hell can you listen to four pieces of music at the
same time? <br>
DATA: Actually, I am capable of distinguishing over one hundred and
fifty simultaneous compositions, but in order to analyse the
aesthetics, I try to keep it to ten or less. <br>
RASMUSSEN: Only four today? <br>
DATA: I am assisting Commander La Forge with a very complex
calculation. It demands a great deal of my concentration. <br>
RASMUSSEN: Well, I came to thank you for answering my questions, though
I probably should have asked you to limit yourself to fifty thousand
words. <br>
DATA: You did ask me to be thorough. <br>
RASMUSSEN: I realise it's hard to believe, Data, but very few records
of Doctor Soong's work survived to the twenty sixth century, so it
would be invaluable to myself and other historians, if you could
provide us with some schematics. <br>
DATA: Certainly, as soon as my work here is completed. <br>
RASMUSSEN: As long as it's before oh nine hundred tomorrow. That's when
I'll be heading back. <br>
WORF [OC]: Bridge to Commander Data. <br>
DATA: Yes, Worf. <br>
WORF: Commander La Forge is hailing you from the surface, sir. <br>
DATA: Patch him through, please. <br>
LAFORGE [on monitor]: Have you rerun the phase reversal figures, Data? <br>
DATA: There were no errors, Geordi. The variance must be no more than
point zero six terawatts. <br>
LAFORGE [on monitor]: Well, I don't see any other choice. We'll
continue to run the numbers down here but I doubt we'll come up with
anything different. You better inform the captain of the good news and
the bad news. La Forge out. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: The good news. <br>
DATA: The motion of the dust has created a great deal of electrostatic
energy in the upper atmosphere. With a modified phaser blast, we could
create a shock front that would encircle the planet and ionise the
particles. <br>
PICARD: That would be like striking a spark in a gas-filled room. <br>
DATA: With one exception, sir. The particles would be converted into a
high energy plasma which our shields could absorb and then re-direct
harmlessly into space. <br>
PICARD: Turn the Enterprise into a lightning rod? <br>
DATA: Precisely, sir. <br>
PICARD: And the bad news? <br>
DATA: If our phaser discharge is off by as little as point zero six
terawatts, it would cause a cascading exothermal inversion. <br>
PICARD: Meaning? <br>
DATA: We would completely burn off the planet's atmosphere.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Come. <br>
(Rasmussen enters) <br>
PICARD: I imagine you know why I've asked you here. <br>
RASMUSSEN: Yeah, I have a fairly good idea. <br>
PICARD: I'm faced with a dilemma. There is a planet beneath us which is
slowly turning to ice, and unless we do something about it, I'm told
that in a matter of weeks thousands, maybe tens of thousands, will die.
<br>
RASMUSSEN: That'd be a shame. <br>
PICARD: Yes, it would. It would be quite a shame. <br>
RASMUSSEN: So, what's your dilemma? <br>
PICARD: Commander La Forge has a possible solution. The margins of
error are extremely critical, but if successful, there'll be no more
threat. <br>
RASMUSSEN: And if it's not successful? <br>
PICARD: Every living thing on the planet will perish. <br>
RASMUSSEN: So do nothing and thousands will die. Do something and
millions could die. That's a tough choice. <br>
PICARD: Not if you were to help me. <br>
RASMUSSEN: You're not suggesting I tell you the outcome of your
efforts? <br>
PICARD: Oh no, I'm not. Everything that Starfleet stands for,
everything that I have ever believed in, tells me I cannot ask you
that.
But at the same time, there are twenty million lives down there, and
you know what happened to them. What will happen to them. <br>
RASMUSSEN: So, it seems you have another dilemma. One that questions
your convictions. <br>
PICARD: Well, I've never been afraid of reevaluating my convictions,
Professor, and now, I have twenty million reasons to do so. <br>
RASMUSSEN: And why did you ask to see me? <br>
PICARD: Because your presence gives me potential access to a kind of
information that I've never had available to me before, and if I am to
re-examine my beliefs, then I must take advantage of every possible
asset. It would be irresponsible of me not to ask you here. <br>
RASMUSSEN: However you come to terms with your beliefs, Captain, I must
tell you that I'm quite comfortable with mine. <br>
PICARD: How can you be? How can you be comfortable watching people die?
<br>
RASMUSSEN: Let me put it to you this way. If I were to tell you that
none of those people died, you'd easily conclude that you tried your
solution and it succeeded. So, you'd confidently try again. No harm in
that. But what if I were to tell you they all died? What then?
Obviously, you'd decide not to make the same mistake twice. Now, what
if one of those people grew up <br>
PICARD: Yes, Professor, I know. What if one of those lives I save down
there is a child who grows up to be the next Adolf Hitler or Khan
Singh? Every first year philosophy student have been asked that
question ever since the earliest wormholes were discovered. But this is
not a class in temporal logic. It's not theoretical, it's not
hypothetical, it's real. Surely you see that? <br>
RASMUSSEN: I see it all too well. But you must see that if I were to
influence you, everything in this sector, in this quadrant of the
galaxy could change. History, my history, would unfold in a way other
than it already has. Now what possible incentive could anyone offer me
to allow that to happen? <br>
PICARD: I have two choices. Either way, one version of history or
another will wend its way forward. The history you know or another one.
Now who is to say which is better? What I do know is here, today, one
way, millions of lives could be saved. Now
isn't that incentive enough? <br>
RASMUSSEN: Everyone dies, Captain. It's just a question of when. All of
those people down there died years before I was born. All of you up
here, as well. So you see, I can't get quite as worked up as you over
the fate of some colonists who, for me, have been dead a very, very
long time. <br>
PICARD: Of course, you know of the Prime Directive, which tells us that
we have no right to interfere with the natural evolution of alien
worlds. Now I have sworn to uphold it, but nevertheless I have
disregarded that directive on more than one occasion because I thought
it was the right thing to do. Now, if you are holding on to some
temporal equivalent of that directive, then isn't it
possible that you have an occasion here to make an exception, to help
me to choose, because it's the right thing to do? <br>
RASMUSSEN: We're not just talking about a choice. It sounds to me like
you're trying to manipulate the future. <br>
PICARD: Every choice we make allows us to manipulate the future. Do I
ask Adrienne or Suzanne to the spring dance? Do I take my holiday on
Corsica or on Risa? A person's life, their future, hinges on each of a
thousand choices. Living is making choices. Now you ask me to believe
that if I make a choice other than the one found in your history books,
then your past will be irrevocably altered. Well, you know, Professor,
perhaps I don't give a damn about your past, because your past is my
future and as far as I'm concerned, it hasn't been written yet. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Captain, the electrostatic conditions are about as good as
they're going to get. If we're going to try this, now's the time. <br>
RASMUSSEN: Please don't ask me, Captain. I can't help you. I'm sorry.

PICARD: Oh, on the contrary, Professor, you were quite helpful. <br>
RASMUSSEN: How's that? <br>
PICARD: By refusing to assist me, you left me with the same choice I
had to began with. To try or not to try, to take a risk or to play it
safe. Your arguments have reminded me how precious the right to choose
is. And because I've never been one to play it safe, I choose to try.
