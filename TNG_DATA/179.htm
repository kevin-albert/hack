travelling with us to his home planet, Kenda Two.

CRUSHER: You look wonderful. <br>

QUAICE: She'd been ill for some time. <br>
CRUSHER: Is her death the reason you're giving up your post here? <br>
QUAICE: We had a lifetime together, doing all the things we'd ever
dreamed, and more. But when she was gone, I couldn't continue to work
in that office, sleep in that bed without her. The absence of her was
too distracting. I'm not sure that I'm making any sense. <br>
CRUSHER: Jack and I didn't have a lifetime together, only a few short
years, but I understand. When you realise someone you love is lost
forever <br>
QUAICE: You know what the worst part of growing old is? So many of the
people you've known all your life are gone and you realise you didn't
take the time to appreciate them while you still could. Oh, I'm sorry.
There was no reason to heap all this emotional baggage on you. I
usually travel light.

his belongings. <br>
WORF: Computer, where is Doctor Dalen Quaice? <br>

PICARD: Could your friend have returned to the starbase without telling

CRUSHER: There were a lot of people going back and forth between the

negative, contact Starbase Command. We should leave nothing to chance. <br>

involving passengers. <br>
CRUSHER: Of course. I don't know why Lieutenant Worf wasn't told about
Doctor Quaice. <br>
PICARD: I was not informed either. <br>
CRUSHER: But I sent in a request weeks ago. <br>
PICARD: Then it must have been intercepted before it reached me. <br>
CRUSHER: And someone else sent the approval? Why? <br>
PICARD: Doctor Quaice had been stationed at the starbase for some time?

O'BRIEN: That was my watch. I beamed this man onboard? <br>
CRUSHER: Yes. I was here to greet him. An elderly man, not in the best

O'BRIEN: I'm sorry. I remember you were here for a short while, but you
were alone. <br>
CRUSHER: Was he invisible? Did I carry on a conversation with thin air?
<br>
O'BRIEN: No, Doctor. As I recall, you came in and you looked around for
a few moments. I asked you if I could help you with anything. All you
said was 'Thank you.' I said, 'My pleasure,' or something, and that was
the end of it. There was no one else here.

warp field equations, trying to improve engine efficiency. <br>
PICARD: I've read your reports. <br>
LAFORGE: We did a test run while we were still at the starbase. Here's
what the computer recorded. <br>
WESLEY: This is the static warp field we created inside the warp drive.
The experiment was designed to see if we could keep a bubble like this
intact. <br>
LAFORGE: As you'll see in a moment, we couldn't. <br>
LAFORGE: There was a momentary flash of light. It was all over the
spectrum. <br>
CRUSHER: I remember that. <br>
PICARD: Are you suggesting that a bubble could have made Doctor Quaice
disappear? <br>
WESLEY: If he were caught in it, yes, sir, it would seem to us like
he'd disappeared. <br>
CRUSHER: Where would he go? <br>
LAFORGE: Who knows. He could even end up outside of our space time
continuum. <br>
PICARD: Was Doctor Quaice in Engineering during your experiment? <br>
LAFORGE: No, sir. <br>
PICARD: And the bubble never expanded beyond Engineering? <br>
WESLEY: No, sir. <br>
PICARD: Then how could it have trapped Doctor Quaice or the others? <br>
LAFORGE: There are others missing? <br>
CRUSHER: Yes, and they weren't anywhere near Engineering. <br>
WESLEY: It doesn't make sense. <br>
PICARD: I doubt the warp bubble could alter computer records, or erase
memories. Keep at it, Ensign, Mister La Forge. It's our only working
theory for now.

Tea, Earl Grey, hot. You're saying this ship has lost nearly eight
hundred of its personnel? <br>
CRUSHER: I know how it sounds. <br>
PICARD: None of the scans show any anomalies. No signs of an intruder.
Wesley's experiment clearly did not have the scope to affect an entire
starship. <br>
CRUSHER: Captain, the Enterprise is in serious danger. You must believe
me. <br>
PICARD: I have no choice but to believe you. The safety of my entire
crew is at stake, but I must be sure. <br>
CRUSHER: That I haven't lost my mind? I just examined myself. And being
the only doctor on board, I had to do it myself. There were no signs of
dysfunction. Yes, there was an increased elevation of adrenalin, but I
think is understandable. <br>
PICARD: Did you find anything that might suggest why you're apparently
the only one among us unaffected by this, this phenomenon? <br>
CRUSHER: No. I'll talk to Troi. <br>
PICARD: It wouldn't do any harm. <br>

PICARD: Is there any possible connection with Mister Crusher's

He said he was some kind of Traveller. Somehow he combined warp
technology and the energy from his own thoughts. <br>

you've accidentally recreated something that he did? Something that
could alter reality? <br>

I sent a message to Tau Alpha C, but it's so far away, it could take
days to get there. <br>

RIKER: What the hell does that mean? <br>
TRAVELLER: Your species have very narrow perceptions of time and space
and thought. When Beverly Crusher was caught in the static warp bubble,
she created her own reality. Her thoughts at the precise moment she was
trapped determined its shape and form. <br>

TRAVELLER: No, it is her reality. I cannot enter it any more than I can
enter her thoughts. <br>
WESLEY: But you said there's still a way. <br>
TRAVELLER: I can help, but I can't do it myself. Wesley, there is a
power within each of us that most people haven't begun to realise, but
you have begun, or else I would not have known to come here now.
Together we may be able to open a gateway for her. But she must choose
to walk through it.
