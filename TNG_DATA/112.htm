PICARD: Starfleet received this subspace transmission two days ago,
Admiral. <br>
JAMESON [on viewscreen]: Let's see it, Captain. <br>
PICARD: On viewer. <br>
(A middle aged man sitting behind an empty desk) <br>
KARNAS [on viewscreen]: I am Karnas, governor of Mordan Four. A
dissident group of terrorists have taken Federation Ambassador Hawkins
and his staff hostage. They will not discuss terms with me. This is a
crisis I cannot resolve. The terrorists are demanding a Federation
negotiator. I feel there is only one negotiator with the skills to
resolve the situation. The lives of the hostages will depend on
Starfleet delivering this man to Mordan.
Commander Mark Jameson. Admiral Jameson. The terrorists have given you
six Earth days to bring him here, or the hostages will die. <br>
PICARD: Starfleet cannot understand how or why this situation has
developed. Mordan Four has finally gained peace after decades of civil
war <br>
JAMESON [on viewscreen]: Forty years of civil war, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Yes, sir. Karnas was largely responsible for the planet's
unification and peace. Why should he now be unable to deal with this
rebellious faction? <br>
JAMESON [on viewscreen]: Forty-five years ago I negotiated a hostage
situation on Mordan, Captain. Karnas was a young man then, but so was
I. He seems to feel that I can handle the situation again. <br>
PICARD: I'm detailed to take you to Mordan Four as soon as you can be
ready, Admiral. <br>
JAMESON: My wife and I will beam aboard at fifteen hundred hours,
Captain. Acknowledge. <br>
PICARD: Received and acknowledged, sir. Picard out. <br>
TROI: Nearly fifteen hundred now, sir. <br>
PICARD: Well, Number One, let's go and welcome the Admiral aboard.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Jameson is in an enclosed wheelchair similar to
Captain Pike's, but with his upper torso free to move) <br>
PICARD: Welcome aboard, Admiral. This is my Executive Officer,
Commander William Riker. <br>
RIKER: My pleasure, sir. Ma'am. <br>
JAMESON: My wife, Anne. Captain, there are certain details of this
mission that you should understand before we begin. <br>
PICARD: Yes, sir. <br>
JAMESON: I am not simply an advisor. On any assignment I accompany,
Starfleet has designated me Senior Mission Officer. I control the away
team and all its actions. Is that understood? Of course, Captain, you
command the ship, but the mission is mine. I trust you are in complete
agreement. <br>
PICARD: Yes, sir. Of course.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GEORDI: Message coming in from Mordan, sir. <br>
PICARD: Put it on the screen, Mister Data. <br>
KARNAS [on viewscreen]: Mordan Four to Enterprise. This is Karnas. I
will speak to the Captain. <br>
PICARD: I am Captain Picard, commanding the Enterprise. <br>
KARNAS [on viewscreen]: Is Admiral Jameson on board? <br>
PICARD: He's here, beside my First Officer. Do you wish to speak to him
now? <br>
KARNAS [on viewscreen]: So, Jameson. I see time has not been kind. <br>
JAMESON: It seldom is, Karnas. However, we could save a good deal of it
now if you'll outline the terrorists' demands. <br>
KARNAS [on viewscreen]: They insist all discussions will take place
here on Mordan. They refuse to speak to me, only to a Federation
mediator. They say they will brook no excuses. If there are any
offered, your ambassador and his people will die. Unpleasantly. I
believe them. So should you, Admiral. <br>
JAMESON: Tell them I accept the conditions of negotiation. <br>
KARNAS [on viewscreen]: I will do so immediately. (transmission ends) <br>
RIKER: For a man in his position, he doesn't seem to know much about
the situation. <br>
JAMESON: Wrong, Number One. He told me that the terrorists are
desperate enough to kill if they're crossed. They are willing to talk,
one on one, but not to him. <br>
PICARD: Counsellor? <br>
TROI: From his body language as well as his words and tone, I'd judge
that what Karnas said was honest. But I sensed a holding back. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps he knows more about the terrorists than he's prepared
to admit. <br>
JAMESON: Possible, but I suspect it's closer to the mark if we said he
doesn't want to admit failure of his own efforts to negotiate. He is a
proud man. <br>
TROI: That could be, sir. Karnas has established himself as a powerful
man on Mordan. Suddenly, in this situation, his power is useless. <br>
CRUSHER [OC]: Sickbay to Bridge. I'm ready for Admiral Jameson now. <br>
PICARD: In a few moments, Doctor. <br>
JAMESON: Ready for what, Captain? <br>
PICARD: Just a routine medical checkup. Ship's regulations.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ready room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: What I don't understand, sir, is how Karnas
knew you were still available. <br>
JAMESON: Still alive, you mean. <br>
RIKER: So far as he knew, sir, you could have been dead. <br>
JAMESON: Quite right, Commander, but I am not, and I imagine Ambassador
Hawkins has told him that. I briefed the Ambassador about Mordan before
he left to take up residence. <br>
PICARD: All right. Karnas has a problem he thinks you can resolve. What
do the terrorists need that Karnas can't, or won't, give them? <br>
DATA: Mordan has had peace for five years. They have finally come to a
state of productivity which satisfies their planetary needs, but no
more than that. Perhaps the dissidents feel the Federation could
provide them with more. <br>
JAMESON: I have negotiated many treaties on many planets, Picard. I've
found that peace, or the appearance of it, is often a prelude to war. <br>
TROI: Admiral, are you suggesting the terrorists want arms and weapons?
<br>
JAMESON: They may. I am suggesting Karnas is the last man to give them
such weapons. <br>
TROI: I see. You believe that Karnas would not negotiate on that point,
and so the terrorists demanded an outside negotiator. <br>
JAMESON: I know Karnas. He is a warrior. He lives for challenge. These
people have insulted his honour by taking the embassy staff hostage.
I'll negotiate, but I'll have to be very careful in dealing with
Karnas. He'll want revenge for that insult. </font></p>

ANNE: Well, it's about time. Couldn't get away from the Bridge? <br>
JAMESON: Didn't want to. Feels good to be on one again. <br>
ANNE: I'm glad, Mark. Do you want me to help you up? <br>
(The front of the wheelchair opens, and he eases himself out and into a
nearby chair) <br>
ANNE: You're stronger today. <br>
JAMESON: I'm fine. I feel like a kid again. <br>
ANNE: This ship is magnificent. It even has family quarters. Pity we
didn't have them twenty, thirty years ago. We could have been together
almost all of your career. Mark! (he's in pain) Mark? I'll get Sickbay.
<br>
JAMESON: No. There's no need. It's happened before. <br>
ANNE: When? You haven't said anything. <br>
JAMESON: It'll pass. Just give me a moment. See, I'm better. It's going
away. <br>
ANNE: What is it? Do the doctors know? <br>
JAMESON: Just body changes. Last checkup they said I'd have to expect
it. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: All the medical information the Admiral
provided is satisfactory, sir. <br>
PICARD: Excellent, Doctor. <br>
CRUSHER: Except for one thing. The test results he gave me aren't two
days old, they're two months old. The medical file coder always
includes the date as part of the file number. He lied to me, sir, and I
don't know why. <br>
PICARD: He is eighty five years old, Doctor. For some, the memory
begins to fail. <br>
CRUSHER: He suffers from Iverson's Disease, sir. It affects the body,
not the mind. No, I have a gut feeling he's hiding something. <br>
PICARD: That is an observation I'd expect from Counsellor Troi. Doctor.
Doctor, I do respect your opinion, and I'll want you on the Bridge for
the next day or so. The Admiral must remain in the best of health for
these negotiations, and he might require your services. </font></p>

Cluster. Would you like to take the conn as we make transit? <br>
JAMESON: Thank you, Captain. I would. <br>
(And he gets out of his wheelchair and walks a little unsteadily down
the slope to Geordi's station) <br>
PICARD: Well, Admiral, quite a little surprise you've pulled on us. <br>
CRUSHER: Yes, quite. <br>
JAMESON: Neglected to mention I began some new therapy before I left.
Seems to be working. I haven't felt this good since the last time I was
in space. The Gettysburg. All I needed to get me out of that chair was
the thought of walking the decks in command of a starship again. <br>
PICARD: Admiral, you only have the conn temporarily. <br>
JAMESON: A figure of speech. Of course she's your ship. I'll just keep
an eye on her for a while.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: The admiral displayed a remarkable
improvement out there, wouldn't you say? <br>
CRUSHER: Captain, no one recovers from Iverson's Disease. There is no
known cure, and there are no cases where it has gone into remission. I
have never heard of any therapy that would produce results like that. <br>
PICARD: Then how do you account for it? <br>
CRUSHER: I can't. All I can tell you is that the Admiral has been
confined to his support chair for the last four years by the effects of
Iverson's. By all the medical facts we know, he should never have
walked again. <br>
PICARD: I want you to look into it, Doctor. Thoroughly. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: I found traces of chemical substances in
his blood and tissue samples, but none of them are in our
pharmacopoeia. I'm still working on alien references to substances like
these. All I can tell you is that he's ingested something that's
strongly affecting his body. <br>
PICARD: Specifics, Doctor. <br>
CRUSHER: Captain, there are so many things going on, I can't give you
specifics until I do a lot more tests. <br>
PICARD: Give me what you have now. <br>
CRUSHER: His red cell count is running riot. The cellular structure of
his body is radically changing, but we can't make any decisions on that
until we know what it's changing to. His DNA is skewed. Don't ask me
how, but he even looks younger. And Captain, there are absolutely no
traces of Iverson's Disease. <br>
PICARD: You said there is no cure for Iverson's. <br>
CRUSHER: None that we know of. But whatever these substances are doing
to his body, at least they've done that for him. But how or why? It's
too early to say. <br>
PICARD: Get me some answers, Doctor. As soon as possible. <br>
CRUSHER: Yes, sir.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ANNE: Captain. <br>
PICARD: Mrs. Jameson, I have to ask the Admiral some questions. <br>
JAMESON: Ask away. There's nothing to hide now. <br>
(He is a lot younger, thirties or forties) <br>
PICARD: Admiral, in addition to your rank, you are a particularly
valuable commodity just now. Starfleet has a right to some answers. <br>
JAMESON: I've planned this for a long time, ever since I learned I had
Iverson's Disease. Since it put me in that chair. <br>
ANNE: What did you do, Mark? <br>
JAMESON: There's a planet in the Cerebus system, Cerebus Two. They say
the natives have a process that rejuvenates the body, gives you your
youth back. <br>
PICARD: Yes, I've heard of that story. It's a myth. <br>
JAMESON: It's true, Picard. I'm living proof. Oh, it's dangerous. The
mortality rate is high, and it's very painful. Aliens are seldom
allowed to obtain the process, but I managed it. I negotiated a treaty
for Cerebus Two some years ago, and they felt obligated to honour my
request for the process. <br>
PICARD: Obviously it works very rapidly, but how does it work? <br>
JAMESON: The herb and drug combinations are self-administered slowly
over a period of two years. Every response is different, depending on a
being's DNA. I got enough for both of us, Annie, but I had to test it
on myself first. I couldn't risk you. If I died, well, I was half a
man, so what did it matter. <br>
ANNE: It would matter to me. <br>
JAMESON: But I was starting to change, Anne. It was almost
undetectable, but the improvement was there. Then when this hostage
situation came up, I knew I'd have to be at my peak to deal with it. I
didn't have time to wait for the drug to work naturally. <br>
PICARD: So you took the whole dose. <br>
JAMESON: I took both of them. And look at me, Annie, look at me. I'm
strong. I'm alert, Fit. I'm fitter than you are, Picard. And I'm
getting younger! <br>
PICARD: The only question I have, Admiral, is why you thought it
necessary to be young to negotiate the release of the hostages. Even
willing to put your life at risk for it. I'll be on the Bridge,
Admiral, if you want to talk further. <br>
(Picard leaves) <br>
ANNE: Why didn't you tell me, Mark? We've always been honest with each
other, until now. <br>
JAMESON: Annie, I did it for us. <br>
ANNE: Oh, I'm sure you believed that, until you had a chance to head up
a mission, to command again, and then you just upended the bottle or
whatever it was, and damn everything. Did you think about me at all? <br>
JAMESON: I obtained enough of the dosage for both of us. <br>
ANNE: But you never asked if I wanted it. It's just like you, Mark, to
assume that what you felt was right was the only answer. <br>
JAMESON: But it was the right answer for me. It was killing you, having
to take care of an invalid. Annie, what good was I to you? We can be
together again. <br>
ANNE: Let me go! <br>
JAMESON: I can get you another supply of the drug.

behind this thing? You said dissidents. <br>

JAMESON: Then who is it? Ardan? Gilnor? <br>
KARNAS [on monitor]: They're dead, Jameson. A long time now. For a long
time I thought you were dead, too. <br>
JAMESON: I almost died a couple of times on missions, but I always made
it through somehow. <br>
KARNAS [on monitor]: Yes. Now you're coming back to Mordan to negotiate
for hostages again. It's almost as though the forty five years
in-between never happened. <br>

JAMESON: There are no dissidents, are there? No terrorists. You have
the hostages. <br>

and you're going to negotiate for their lives. And I'm going to ask a
very, very high price. <br>
JAMESON: What if I refuse? <br>
KARNAS [on monitor]: Then the hostages will die. You've seen how my
executioners work. They are still as efficient as they were, perhaps
even more skilled now. You'll come, even if you don't have much honour

of our announced ETA. It'll throw Karnas off balance, and we can catch
him before he's ready. <br>
PICARD: Ready for exactly what, Admiral? <br>
JAMESON: I believe Karnas has the hostages, and there never were any
dissidents. <br>
PICARD: What has happened to bring you to that conclusion? That's quite
a big jump. <br>
JAMESON: I'm not at liberty to say, Picard, but negotiations are no
longer the answer. <br>
PICARD: Isn't the most important thing the hostage's lives? <br>
JAMESON: And you agree with that too, Riker? <br>

JAMESON: Good. Because I plan to personally lead an away team on an
armed rescue mission to get them out of there. <br>

JAMESON: Commander Data, bring up the plans I requested on the
viewscreen, please. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
JAMESON: Most of Mordan's principal city was devastated during the war.
What was left consisted largely of a network of underground tunnels. A
rat's maze. When they rebuilt the city, they simply built over the
tunnels. <br>
DATA: I have it, sir. <br>
LAFORGE: Pardon me, sir, but where do these tunnels come into the
picture? <br>
JAMESON: This is where Karnas held his hostages before and where I
believe he has them now. <br>
PICARD: Wouldn't that be a little obvious, Admiral? <br>
JAMESON: Karnas is a dogged strategist, Picard, not a brilliant one. He
sticks to what works. He will kill the hostages if we do not get them
out of there. <br>
PICARD: Therefore you see this armed raid as the only option. <br>
JAMESON: You don't agree? <br>
PICARD: With respect, Admiral, I would point out no one else has heard
or considered Karnas's demands. The Federation might view them
differently if they knew what they were. <br>

sophistication, but were still ruled by tribal family units. Karnas's
father was the ruling chief of one of the families. Another tribe had
him assassinated. Karnas seized the passengers of a starliner and held
them hostage, demanding that Starfleet provide him with weapons that
would enable him to defeat his rivals. <br>
PICARD: That's the official record. <br>
JAMESON: Officially, the story is that after two other mediators were
murdered, I went in and negotiated with Karnas to bring out the
hostages safely. <br>
PICARD: Are you saying that's not the truth? <br>
JAMESON: It wasn't my golden oratory that saved them, Captain. I gave
Karnas the weapons he wanted. <br>
PICARD: You did what? <br>
JAMESON: I gave exactly the same weapons to his rivals. My
interpretation of the Prime Directive. Let them solve their problems
with those arms on an equal basis. <br>
PICARD: And that decision plunged them into forty years of civil war. <br>
JAMESON: I didn't know that would happen. I thought a minor war. It
would be settled in less than a year. How would I know it would take
four decades? But I falsified the reports to Starfleet, and I lived
with that on my soul, Picard. Sixty-three people came away safe but
millions died on Mordan because I delivered those weapons. <br>
PICARD: Karnas could have worked for peace during those years instead
of continuing the war. It's not all on your head, Admiral. <br>
JAMESON: But I started it. I lit the match. Now finally I can vindicate
myself, if only in a small way. I came to negotiate, but that isn't
what Karnas wants. <br>
PICARD: Revenge. That's why he demanded you when he knew that you were
still alive. <br>
JAMESON: And I'm not going to give it to him, Picard. I'm going to do
what I should have done the first time. We're taking the hostages out
by force, if necessary. No deals.

JAMESON: Prepare to energise, Chief. <br>
PICARD: Belay that. Admiral, your proper place is on the Bridge. <br>
JAMESON: I will remind you one more time, Picard, I am the Senior
Mission Commander and I'm leading this team. <br>
RIKER: Sir? <br>
PICARD: The Admiral is correct, Number One. He has that right. But I am
the Captain of this ship, and I have a right to accompany him. Riker,
you're in command of the Enterprise. Energise.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(It is spacious, good high ceiling with light
streaming through, curved concrete walls) <br>
JAMESON: Yes, perfect. We are in the M4 tunnel, directly under the
Governor's residence. M-4 is a subsidiary tunnel, but it crosses and
links with several main ones. <br>
DATA: I am sorry, sir. That does not correspond with the information in
my tricorder, sir.
JAMESON: Your information is incorrect, Commander. I know these tunnels
like the back of my own hand. Keep scanning for signs of human life
forms. Karnas held his hostages in these tunnels before. He'll do it
again. <br>
(The group head down a tunnel) <br>
DATA: Captain, the Admiral is definitely incorrect. The tunnel
schematics we have show this to be a dead end. It was sealed off two
years ago. <br>
PICARD: No doubt you're right, Mister Data. However, forty five years
ago, I'm sure it linked in with the tunnels the Admiral remembers. <br>
(They arrive at the dead end) <br>
JAMESON: Damn. <br>
PICARD: Geordi? <br>
LAFORGE: This is steelplast, sir. Fairly recent installation. <br>
JAMESON: This is the most direct route. Set phasers to cut through it. <br>
(Worf and Tasha cut an opening in the wall) <br>
TASHA: If you have the coordinates where you think the hostages are,
sir, we could just beam in over there. <br>
JAMESON: Karnas may not have them in the same place. There's no
substitute, Lieutenant, for personal reconnoitre. <br>
(He leads them through the hole) <br>
LAFORGE: Admiral, there's an infrared light signal ahead. Steady beam,
straight across the tunnel, chest high. There's another at waist level.
<br>
TASHA: An alarm trigger or <br>
PICARD: Reset phasers to stun. <br>
(A phaser beam just misses them) <br>
PICARD: Take cover! <br>
(Armed soldiers appear. Every one ducks behind convenient barrels and
suchlike. Tasha gets in front of Picard. Jameson stands exposed) <br>
WORF: Sir, look out! <br>
(Worf knocks Jameson out of the way of another blast) <br>
DATA: Their phasers, sir, set on kill. <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. I have heard the sound before. <br>
(Tasha takes out two soldiers, then Jameson cries in pain) <br>
TASHA: Is he hit? <br>
DATA: No sign of a wound. <br>

KARNAS: Who are you? I want Jameson. <br>
PICARD: Karnas, this is Admiral Mark Jameson. <br>
KARNAS: This charade will accomplish nothing, Picard. Beam down
Jameson, and the hostages will be freed. Continue this and I promise
you they will die. And you with them. <br>
JAMESON: Peretor Karnas, you always were a stubborn man. I thought you
wanted me. I'm here. Release the hostages now. <br>
KARNAS: Peretor was my old title. Why do you call me that? I warn you,
Picard. This trick is going too far. He has been coached for some
devious reason. If this farce does not stopped immediately, you and the
hostages will be put to death. <br>
(Jameson doubles up in pain) <br>
PICARD: Doctor! <br>
KARNAS: I am waiting for an explanation, Captain. <br>
PICARD: He is the Admiral, Karnas. Before he left on this mission, he
administered an overdose of an alien de-aging drug to himself. He
wanted to face you with strength again, on even terms. This is what the
drug has done to him. <br>
KARNAS: This story you are telling is unbelievable. Jameson is a man of
more than eighty years, not this. I want that old man, Picard. I want
to show him this world he helped to make. The scars on old soldiers'
bodies. The graveyards of our young dead. The wasted cities we are
still rebuilding. And all of it caused by him. <br>
PICARD: As I understand it, Karnas, you were the one who demanded the
weapons to avenge your father's death. <br>
KARNAS: But Jameson didn't give weapons to only us. If he had, we would
have quickly triumphed over our enemies, and there would have been
peace in all these decades. I want him to pay for that, Picard. <br>
CRUSHER: Captain, I think Mrs. Jameson should beam down now. <br>
PICARD: Enterprise, this is Picard. Have Mrs. Jameson prepare to beam
down. Karnas, I asked Doctor Crusher to bring with her the visual
records we've made of Admiral Jameson's deterioration. Will you look at
them? <br>
KARNAS: You're wasting my time, Picard. <br>
PICARD: Just a few moments. You saw the Admiral on the Enterprise when
he was en route to Mordan? <br>
KARNAS: Yes. <br>
PICARD: And you recognised him? <br>
KARNAS: Yes. <br>
PICARD: Is this the man you saw? <br>
(picture of old Jameson on a small screen) <br>
KARNAS: This is the man I want. <br>
PICARD: He's here, Karnas. Look. Once he took the compound there was no
way to stop it. <br>
(Anne beams down and goes straight to Jameson and Crusher) <br>
PICARD: You'll have to deal with me, Karnas. Whatever you wanted from
Jameson isn't possible any more. And you wanted revenge. You blamed
your war on him, and there's no doubt he had a lot to do with it. But
you had the weapons and you used them. You could have tried for
negotiations for peace on your planet long ago. Instead you chose to
fight. How many of those forty years of civil war are on your head,
Karnas? <br>
KARNAS: Jameson has to pay for his crimes. I have sworn it to my
people. <br>
PICARD: Forty five years ago he made the wrong decision. He wanted to
come here to somehow right it, to atone for what he did. Now all he can
do is to give himself up to you. He brought this retribution on
himself. <br>
KARNAS: No. I don't believe you. You're shielding Jameson on the ship
and you're telling me this tale to save his life. <br>
JAMESON: Peretor Karnas, there were only two of us in the meeting. You
didn't even trust your lieutenants there. You told me that old Peretor
Sain had ordered your father's assassination. You told me that you
wanted arms to destroy him. Peace wasn't on your mind. All you wanted
was revenge. And I gave you the weapons to do it. <br>
KARNAS: Jameson told you this. If it is you, show me the scar. <br>
(Jameson shows his wrist) <br>
JAMESON: There. The blood cut you gave me to seal our bargain. <br>
KARNAS: It is you. Somehow it is you. (takes a gun from the wall) Then
die by your own weapon! No. No, my revenge will be in seeing you live
like this. Such pain. <br>
CRUSHER: The compound he took is forcing his cells and organs to go
further, younger, and they can't take the stress. It's like they're
imploding. And I can't give him anything to stop it. <br>
PICARD: Can you ease the pain? <br>
(Crusher shakes her head) <br>
ANNE: Mark, can you hear me? <br>
JAMESON: Yes. <br>
ANNE: I'll always love you. <br>
JAMESON: Annie with the golden hair. <br>
ANNE: Flatterer. It's grey now. <br>
JAMESON: I&nbsp;see only the gold. <br>
(He dies in her arms) <br>
KARNAS: Rest, Jameson. Your long night, and mine, are over. The
hostages will be freed immediately, Captain. I'm prepared to be
cooperative.
