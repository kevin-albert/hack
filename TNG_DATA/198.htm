Personal log, Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge, stardate 44885.5. I am en
route to the planet Risa to attend an artificial intelligence
seminar. Captain Picard has ordered me to arrive a few days early to
have some fun and relax. I intend to follow his orders to the very best
of my ability.

LAFORGE: How about some different music, Computer. Something with a
Latin beat. No, I meant something with a gentle Latin beat. Maybe a
Spanish guitar. Perfect. Hey, what's the weather like on Risa? <br>
COMPUTER: Risa is climate-controlled for optimum tourist comfort, <br>
LAFORGE: Is that right? How long before we get there? <br>
COMPUTER: Arrival at Risa is scheduled for oh nine thirty two hours. <br>
LAFORGE: Three hours. How about a game, computer? <br>

LAFORGE: Something to pass the time, you know, a diversion. <br>
COMPUTER: Select either visual interactive or verbal interactive. <br>
LAFORGE: Verbal. <br>
COMPUTER: You have twenty seconds to respond to each question. Level of
difficulty will increase as you progress. Proceed when ready. <br>
LAFORGE: Begin. <br>
COMPUTER: List the resonances of the subquantum states associated with
transitional relativity. <br>
LAFORGE: That's easy. <br>
COMPUTER: In alphabetical order. <br>
LAFORGE: Er, well, asymmetrical, inverted, phased, stable. <br>
COMPUTER: Your time has expired. <br>
COMPUTER: The fifth resonance is <br>

LAFORGE: I knew that. Okay, give me another one. <br>
COMPUTER: List the field patterns associated with warp modulation in
order of decreasing energy. <br>

uncloaks) <br>
LAFORGE: Oh, there's the aft nacelle associative, the forward (sees the

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 44891.6. The Enterprise has
been ordered to accompany a special emissary from the Klingon High
Council to the Kriosian System, where one of their colonies is fighting
for independence.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ready room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KELL: There was a time when the Empire would crush
a rebellion. Now it is tolerated. We have enough problems on the
home planet. We don't wish to divert resources to such a trivial war. <br>
PICARD: You're prepared to grant them independence? <br>
KELL: Perhaps. We'll conquer them again later, if we wish. <br>
PICARD: May I ask, Ambassador, what has this to do with us? <br>
KELL: The Governor of Krios has charged that the Federation is secretly
aiding the rebels. <br>
RIKER: Does he have evidence? <br>
KELL: The Council has sent me here to examine that evidence. It was my
decision to invite you to accompany me, Captain. Many on the Council
have great respect for you. <br>
PICARD: K'adlo. I have been pleased to offer occasional assistance to
the Klingon people in the past. <br>
KELL: Your modesty is very human, Captain. I will excuse it. <br>
PICARD: I can assure you, Ambassador, the Federation would never
interfere in the internal affairs of the Empire. <br>
KELL: Let us hope not. Such interference would strike at the very basis
of our alliance. <br>
RIKER: Captain, we are in the war zone. <br>
PICARD: Indeed. Ambassador, I will ask our Chief Security officer,
Lieutenant Worf, to make a report <br>
KELL: Captain, Worf's discommendation makes that very awkward. If I
could work with one of the other security officers <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant Worf is my Chief of Security and my tactical
officer. This matter clearly falls within his jurisdiction. <br>
KELL: As you wish.

beam. Geordi is dragged into a room and strapped into a chair) <br>
LAFORGE: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, take it easy! (his head is fastened) Hey. <br>
TAIBAK: Welcome, Mister La Forge. We've waited a long time to meet you.
<br>
LAFORGE: I can tell you've gone to a lot of trouble. <br>
TAIBAK: Indeed we have. You are going to be of great help to us. <br>
LAFORGE: I wouldn't count on it. <br>
(a Geordi look-alike comes in) <br>
TAIBAK: Good. Very good. Do not enjoy
yourself too much on Risa. <br>
(the look-alike leaves. Geordi's visor is removed) <br>
LAFORGE: Hey! <br>
TAIBAK: Your visor will be returned to you, but first I want to show
you something. <br>
LAFORGE: Show me something? That'll be an interesting trick seeing as
how I can't see anything without the visor. <br>
(metal arms are swung around to the sides of his head) <br>
TAIBAK: That is not quite true. Allow me to demonstrate. I now have
direct access to his visual cortex. He has no choice
but to see what I wish him to see. I can feed him any image I choose.
He will be unable to ignore it. His galvanic skin response has
increased nine percent. It seems Commander La Forge, like many humans,
has a low tolerance for watching others suffer. <br>
LAFORGE: Why are you doing this? <br>
TAIBAK: I am sorry, Commander. It is a necessary step. I apologize for
your discomfort. <br>
(Taibak speaks to a figure which remains in the shadows throughout) <br>
TAIBAK: Here. Observe how a spring day on his native Earth affects him.
He's looking at a beautiful meadow, green trees, birds, a blue sky. The
heartbeat slows, the galvanic skin response drops. The body responds to
our stimuli. He is incapable of maintaining control of his own
responses. Watch as I change the stimuli again. Once our work is done,
La Forge will act normally, totally unaware of his conditioning. The
perfect tool for our purpose. <br>
WOMAN: Will there be any physical evidence of what you are doing to
him? <br>
(hmm that voice sounds familiar) <br>
TAIBAK: None, Commander. That is why we chose La Forge. The utilisation
of his pre-existing neural implants makes our work impossible to
detect. <br>
WOMAN: How will we be certain the procedure has been successful? <br>
TAIBAK: I will programme him to perform a series of specific tests,
both before he leaves us and after he returns to the Enterprise. We'll
be able to verify his effectiveness. Notice that his heart rate has
slowed somewhat. He is becoming accustomed to the horrors he is
witnessing. So, we change horrors. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KELL: There have been two rebel attacks on neutral
freighters. One a Ferengi, the other Cardassian. <br>
WORF: Both were engaged near the Ikalian asteroid belt. That's where
the rebels must be hiding. <br>
KELL: The actinides in the asteroids provide positive protection
against our sensors. <br>
WORF: They might attack a freighter, but I doubt they would challenge a
Federation starship. <br>
KELL: Especially with the Federation furnishing them support. <br>
WORF: You would test the Captain's word with me, Kell? Is it because I
have no honour in your eyes that you expect me to be disloyal? <br>
KELL: Wrong of me to ask. My apologies. <br>
WORF: Captain Picard does not lie. If he says there is no Federation
assistance to the rebels, there is none. <br>
KELL: Good. Because I risked my own reputation and honour coming to
Picard. <br>
WORF: He will not disappoint you. If that is all. <br>
KELL: There are some members of the High Council who would thank you,
Worf. <br>
WORF: Thank me? <br>
KELL: For killing Duras. No doubt that had he lived, one day he would
ascended to head the Council. Many were not looking forward to that. <br>
WORF: My motives were personal, not political. <br>
KELL: Motives? Who cares for motives? Humans perhaps. What matters is
you acted that day as a true Klingon.

LAFORGE: Almost four years. <br>

LAFORGE: Okay. <br>
TAIBAK: Take this phaser and kill Chief O'Brien. <br>
(O'Brien is talking quietly to colleagues when Geordi walks over) <br>
O'BRIEN: Finally I think I've found it. You see, this piece of conduit
carrying the power to transporter seven, and I know that can't be
right, so I take a closer look and sure enough <br>
TAIBAK: Freeze simulations. Commander, did you understand my request? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, I, it's just I, I don't <br>
TAIBAK: Look at me. Now, what did I ask you to do? <br>

RIKER: E-band? That's unusual. What's the source? <br>

VAGH: As you wish. I have hundreds more. <br>
PICARD: Even if these weapons are genuine, I can assure you that a
third party must have been involved. The Federation is not in the
business of supplying arms to rebels. <br>
VAGH: This is the only Klingon colony on the border of Federation
space. You cannot deny that Starfleet would be happy to see Krios gain
its independence. It would reduce your vulnerability to an attack. <br>

phaser rifle) <br>
DATA: Energy flow is within normal parameters, from the pre-fire
chamber to the emission aperture. <br>
LAFORGE: Rapid nadion pulse, right on target. Beam control assembly,
safety interlock, both checked out. Beam width intensity controls also
responding correctly. <br>
DATA: Energy cell usage remains constant at one point oh five
megajoules per second. Curious. The efficiency reading on the discharge
crystal is well above Starfleet specifications. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, by quite a bit. Ninety four point one percent
efficiency. <br>
DATA: Our most efficient discharge crystal typically fires with eighty
six point five percent efficiency. <br>
LAFORGE: Let's take a closer look at the wave pattern on the emission
beam. That might tell us why it's losing so little energy. <br>
DATA: Pulse frequency out of pre-fire chamber reads steady. <br>
LAFORGE: There. That's not right. The initial output spike is inverted.
<br>
DATA: That might suggest that the weapon has been charged with a forced
pulse, well into the terahertz range. <br>
LAFORGE: Then it's definitely not Starfleet issue and there can't be
that many systems that use the terahertz feeds. <br>
DATA: Three hundred twenty seven, to our knowledge. We can probably
achieve an exact match with a random computer search. It will take
approximately three hours. <br>
LAFORGE: I think we could narrow this down with a little common sense,
Data. Who has the most to gain from a conflict between the Klingon
Empire and the Federation?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: The Romulans. They fashioned a perfect
Federation rifle but they had to charge it from their energy sources.
So the discharge crystal and the emission beam pattern correspond to
those you'd find in a Romulan disrupter. <br>
VAGH: The Romulans have no interest in Kriosian independence. The
planet is too far from their borders. <br>
PICARD: But they do have an interest in driving the Federation and the
Empire apart. Our alliance is the only thing that has kept them in
check. <br>
VAGH: Romulan replications using stolen Federation technology? <br>
KELL: It's a typical Romulan ploy. An attempt to sow dissension and
mistrust. Commander, you've done well. I would thank you on behalf of
the Empire. <br>

this one did not originate from the same location as the first. <br>

different control systems. <br>
WORF: Which members of the crew could have accomplished that? <br>
LAFORGE: I think I could have done it, if I put my mind to it. The
Chief, Data, Lieutenant Costa, that's about it. <br>
WORF: Procedure requires that I ask each of you where you were at
eleven twenty three hours. <br>
O'BRIEN: I was with Keiko, in the Arboretum. <br>
DATA: I was on the Bridge at my station. <br>
LAFORGE: I was in my quarters. <br>
WORF: Was anyone with you? <br>
LAFORGE: No, I was alone. Costa was on duty in Engineering. I'm sure
he's got twenty witnesses. <br>
WORF: Then there is someone on board who isn't what he or she seems to
be. <br>
LAFORGE: Data, let's do a detailed scan on every chip in this assembly.
There's got to be some kind of trail we can follow.

altered? <br>
LAFORGE: Programmed to erase all operator commands once the transfer
was complete. <br>
KELL: But with the chips erased, what evidence remained? <br>
DATA: The erasures were complete. However, an analysis of the subatomic
structure revealed an almost undetectable residual
pattern. In time, we may be able to reconstruct the perpetrator's
authorisation code. <br>
KELL: Do you have any idea who's responsible? <br>
LAFORGE: No, sir. Everyone with the necessary skills also has an alibi,
except for me, that is. I was alone in my quarters at the time. <br>
KELL: Then whoever did this must have been specially trained for the
task. <br>
PICARD: Our forensic team is trying to identify anyone who might have
been in cargo bay four today. <br>
LAFORGE: It's not going to be easy. There were a lot of people in and
out of there. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Data. <br>
DATA: Yes, Commander. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Sensors have picked up another E-band emission. <br>
DATA: Acknowledged, I will be there shortly. <br>
KELL: E-band emission? <br>
DATA: We have been picking up a curious intermittent blip. Commander
Riker has speculated that it may be a Romulan transmission. I am
attempting to track its source. <br>
PICARD: Proceed. Thank you, Mister La Forge. <br>
(Geordi and Data leave) <br>
KELL: We do not have much time, Picard. Vagh is not known for his

PICARD: Assure him that we are doing everything possible. And, advise
him that if necessary I will defend my ship. <br>
KELL: With your permission, I will transport down to the planet. <br>
PICARD: Of course. <br>
KELL: May I suggest that you issue an invitation to Vagh, to personally
witness your continuing investigation. <br>
PICARD: Do you think he will come? <br>
KELL: I will do everything in my power to see that he does. Qapla',

there's nothing physically wrong. There's a minor vascular irregularity
in the visual cortex. A slight dilation of the blood vessels. It's
nothing serious. What about your visor? Has it been giving you any
problems lately? <br>

RIKER: Mister Data, we have a known spy on board and now we have

of covert communication. <br>
RIKER: We need more than speculation, Mister Data. We need to know who,

Commander La Forge was abducted by Romulans en route to Risa. It is
likely that he was somehow forced to take part in the plot to
assassinate Governor Vagh. <br>
KELL: I saw no evidence of Romulans. We just witnessed him acting very
much alone. <br>
DATA: No, sir, you did not. I do not believe the Commander is acting of
his own accord. He has been receiving E-band signals through his visor.
Signals which are carrying direct commands to his brain. I have
surmised that Commander La Forge was conditioned by Romulans, a process
referred to historically, and somewhat inaccurately, as brainwashing. <br>
VAGH: But to what end? Why would the Romulans want to kill me? <br>
PICARD: The Romulans have always wanted to destroy the alliance between
the Federation and the Klingons. If Mister La Forge had killed you,
Governor, I think you would agree, they might have succeeded. <br>
KELL: Who sent these signals? A cloaked Romulan ship? <br>
DATA: No, sir. That is not possible. The signals had to be transmitted
within close proximity to the visor. <br>

proximity to La Forge when he was receiving the signals? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir, I am. <br>
VAGH: This Romulan accomplice, who is he? <br>
DATA: I have narrowed the list of possibilities to two people. The only
two people who were with Commander La Forge all three times a
transmission was recorded. Captain Picard and Ambassador Kell. One of
them may be concealing an E-band transmitter. If they would agree to be
searched <br>
KELL: I am a Klingon. An emissary of the High Council. I will not be
submit to being searched by you or anyone else on this ship. <br>
