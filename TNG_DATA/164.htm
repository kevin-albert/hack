TROI: How do you do, Lal? <br>
LAL: I am functioning within normal parameters. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Lal has a positronic brain one very similar
to my own. I began programming it at the cybernetics conference. <br>
LAFORGE: But nobody's ever been able to do that, Data, at least not
since you were programmed. <br>
DATA: True, but here was a new submicron matrix transfer technology
introduced at the conference which I discovered could be used to lay
down complex neural net pathways. <br>
WESLEY: So you did a transfer from your brain into Lal's. <br>
DATA: Exactly, Wesley. I realised for the first time it was possible to
continue Doctor Soong's work. My initial transfers produced very
encouraging results, so I brought Lal's brain back with me. <br>
PICARD: Data, I would like to have been consulted. <br>
DATA: I have not observed anyone else on board consulting you about
their procreation, Captain. <br>
TROI: Why didn't you give it a more human look, Data? <br>
DATA: I decided to allow my child to choose its own sex and appearance.

PICARD: Commander Data, at your convenience, I would like to talk to
you in my Ready room. Counsellor? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: I insist we do whatever we can to
discourage the perception of this new android as a child. It is not a
child. It is an invention, albeit an extraordinary one. <br>
TROI: Why should biology rather than technology determine whether it is
a child? Data has created an offspring. A new life out of his own
being. To me, that suggests a child. If he wishes to call Lal his
child, then who are we to argue? <br>
PICARD: Well, if he must, but I fail to understand how a five foot
android with heuristic learning systems and the strength of a ten men
can be called a child. <br>

ramifications. I am truly dismayed that you told
no one of what you were doing. <br>
DATA: I am sorry, Captain. I did not anticipate your objections. Do you
wish me to deactivate Lal? <br>
PICARD: It's a life, Data. It can't be activated and deactivated
simply. This is a most stupendous undertaking. Have you any idea what
will happen when Starfleet learns about this? <br>
DATA: I have followed all of Starfleet regulations to the best of my
ability. I expected they would be pleased. <br>
PICARD: Well, you have taken on quite a responsibility, Data. <br>
DATA: To prepare, I have scanned all available literature on parenting.
There seems to be much confusion on this issue. One traditional
doctrine insists, spare the rod and spoil the child, suggesting a
punitive approach. While another more liberal
attitude would allow the child enormous freedom. <br>
PICARD: Data <br>
DATA: And what Klingons do to their children <br>
PICARD: Data! I'm not talking about parenting. I am talking about the
extraordinary consequences of creating new life. <br>
DATA: Does that not describe becoming a parent, sir? <br>
PICARD: Data, you are seeking to achieve what only your own creator has
been able to achieve. To make another functioning, sentient, android.
To make another Data. <br>
DATA: That is why I must attempt this, sir. I have observed that in
most species, there is a primal instinct to perpetuate themselves.
Until now, I have been the last of my kind. If I were to be damaged or
destroyed, I would be lost forever. But if I am successful
with the creation of Lal, my continuance is assured. I understand the
risk, sir. and I am prepared to accept the responsibility.

Training in social skills at the most elementary level has begun. Lal
is progressing very slowly but is not deterred by early setbacks. While
motor coordination has improved twelve percent, reflexes still need to
develop. Visual comprehension is especially difficult for Lal.
Translating her vast data banks into recognisable applications may
improve with additional transfers. She is also learning to supplement
her innate android behaviour with simulated human responses. And it is
interesting to note that as I observe Lal learning about her world, I
share in her experience, almost as though I am learning things over
again.

telling you that our function is to contribute in a positive way to the
world in which we live. <br>
LAL: Why am I me instead of someone else? <br>
DATA: Because you are my child. <br>
LAL: Where did I come from? <br>

of the heuristic associative pathways. You will now begin to process
information on logic, aesthetics, metaphysics, and epistemology. You
are truly becoming sentient, Lal. <br>

how isolated she is from the others. She wishes to be more like them. I
do not know how to help her. Lal is passing into sentience. It is
perhaps the most difficult stage of her development. <br>
CRUSHER: When Wesley was growing up, he was an extraordinarily bright
boy, but he had a hard time making friends. I think the other children
were a little intimidated by him. <br>
DATA: That is precisely what happened to Lal in school. How did you
help him? <br>
CRUSHER: Well, first I went back to my own childhood and remembered how
painful it was for me. Because I remember a time when I wasn't very
popular either. And when I told that to Wesley, it made him feel a
little better. He knew I understood what he was going through. <br>

did not wish it to discourage her. Perhaps this was an error of
judgement. <br>

sentience. She at least has you. Just help her realise that she's not
alone, and be there to nurture her when she needs love and attention. <br>

HAFTEL: Her neural nets are laid down identically to yours? <br>
DATA: There do seem to be some variations on the quantum level. She can
use contractions. I cannot. <br>
HAFTEL: An aberration. What have you done about this? <br>
DATA: I have maintained records on positronic matrix activity,
behavioral norms, and all verbal patterns. I have seen no evidence of
other aberrations. <br>
PICARD: It would seem you've actually improved upon yourself, Data. <br>
DATA: Is that not the goal of every parent, sir? <br>
HAFTEL: But as a good father, don't you think it would be better,
especially in light of this new aberration, if Lal were close to people
trained in diagnostic and evaluative procedures? <br>
DATA: I am programmed with the procedures you mention, sir. And in any
meaningful evaluation of Lal, you would require a model for a basis of
comparison. I am the only model available, Admiral. <br>
HAFTEL: You haven't mastered human cultural and behavioural norms
yourself yet, have you? <br>
DATA: No, sir. <br>
HAFTEL: Where is Lal now?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HAFTEL: This is your idea of appropriate guidance? <br>
DATA: It is an opportunity for her to observe human behaviour and more
importantly, for her to interact with her crewmates. <br>
HAFTEL: She is capable of running over sixty trillion calculations per
second, and you have her working as a cocktail waitress. <br>
PICARD: Admiral, she is under the strict guidance of a woman in whom I
have absolute trust. Ten Forward is the centre of the ship's social
activity. Everyone on board comes here. <br>
HAFTEL: I'm not convinced the sort of behaviour she observes here will
be a positive influence. <br>
GUINAN: Most people when they come here behave themselves. If they
don't, I ask them to leave. <br>
PICARD: Admiral Haftel, Guinan. She runs Ten Forward. How is Lal doing?
<br>
GUINAN: She spills a few drinks every now and then, but she's learning.
<br>
HAFTEL: I want the android out of here. <br>
GUINAN: Now, Admiral, you've been in one or two bars in your time. <br>
HAFTEL: Have her report to me immediately for an interview.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HAFTEL: Well, Lal, I've been looking forward to
meeting you. <br>
LAL: Why? <br>
HAFTEL: You're very important to us at Starfleet Research. We have got
quite a facility at Galor Four. I want like to show it to you. <br>
PICARD: In fact, the Admiral is fact suggesting you be moved to Galor
Four, Lal. <br>
LAL: Have I done something wrong? <br>
HAFTEL: Oh, no, of course not. We just want to broaden your experience.
There's only so much you can learn on a starship. I'm sure you'll agree
to that. <br>
LAL: Yes, I'll agree. <br>
HAFTEL: Good. <br>
LAL: Thus, the natural conclusion would be when I have learned all
there is to learn aboard the starship, I would relocate to Galor Four. <br>
HAFTEL: That is not the natural conclusion here. <br>
LAL: I believe it is. <br>
PICARD: You see, Lal, the Admiral is concerned that you need more
guidance than your father can provide here on the Enterprise. <br>
HAFTEL: Yes. Don't misunderstand me, I have great respect for your
father. <br>
LAL: You do not speak with respect. <br>
HAFTEL: She seems very adversarial. <br>
LAL: I'm merely stating a fact, Admiral. <br>
HAFTEL: I don't think your father has taught you selective judgment in
the verbalisation of your own thoughts. That is a skill we will help
you develop. <br>
LAL: My father is already helping me, sir. <br>
HAFTEL: The question is, has he helped you enough? <br>
LAL: Are you asking me, sir? <br>
HAFTEL: No, I didn't mean to ask any <br>
PICARD: Why don't we, Admiral? In all these discussions, no one has
ever mentioned her wishes. She's a free, sentient being. What are your
wishes, Lal? <br>
LAL: I wish to remain here, Captain Picard. <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Lal. You're excused.

(Lal enters, obviously upset) <br>
TROI: Hello, Lal. How are you? <br>
LAL: Troi. Admiral. Admiral. An admiral from Starfleet has come to take
me away, Troi. I am scared. <br>
TROI: You are scared, aren't you? <br>
LAL: I feel it. How is this possible? <br>
TROI: I don't know. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Observation lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HAFTEL: You have Lal off to a wonderful start in
life, Commander. And that's what being a parent is all about. However,
I have finally decided that I must ask you to release her to me. <br>
DATA: May I ask why, sir? <br>
HAFTEL: All the other arguments aside, there's one that is irrefutable.
There are only two Soong-type androids in existence. It would be very
dangerous to have you both in the same place. Especially aboard a
starship. One lucky shot by a Romulan, we'd lose you both. <br>
PICARD: Admiral, that is a fine argument, but it doesn't change my
feeling that the proper place for Lal to develop is by Data's side. <br>
HAFTEL: You're not a parent, Captain. I am. I have learned, with
difficulty, that there comes a time when all parents must give up their
children for their own good. <br>
PICARD: This is not the time. Damn it, even I can see the umbilical
cord is virtually uncut. The child, the child depends on him. <br>
HAFTEL: Mister Data, it would be better for Lal if she left knowing you
had voluntarily decided that this was the best course of action. <br>
DATA: Admiral, when I created Lal, it was in the hope that someday she
would choose to enter the Academy and become a member of Starfleet. I
wanted to give something back in return for all Starfleet has given me.
I still do. But Lal is my child. You ask that I volunteer to give her
up. I cannot. It would violate every lesson I have learned about human
parenting. I have brought a new life into this world, and it is my
duty, not Starfleet's, to guide her through these first difficult steps
to maturity, to support her as she learns, to prepare her to be a
contributing member of society. No one can relieve me from that
obligation. And I cannot ignore it. I am her father. <br>
HAFTEL: Then I regret that I must order you to transport Lal aboard my
ship. <br>
PICARD: Belay that order, Mister Data. <br>
HAFTEL: I beg your pardon? <br>
PICARD: I will take this to Starfleet myself. <br>
HAFTEL: I am Starfleet, Captain! Proceed, Commander. <br>
PICARD: Hold your ground, Mister Data. <br>
HAFTEL: Captain, you are jeopardising your command and your career. <br>
PICARD: There are times, sir, when men of good conscience cannot
blindly follow orders. You acknowledge their sentience, but you ignore
their personal liberties and freedom. Order a man to hand his child
over to the state? Not while I am his captain. If you wish, you can
accompany us to Starfleet, where we shall see <br>
TROI [OC]: Troi to Commander Data. Report to your lab at once. <br>
PICARD: Acknowledged, Counsellor. He's on his way. Is there a problem? <br>
TROI [OC]: Yes, Captain. Something is terribly wrong with Lal.

fear and confusion. And then for no apparent reason she walked out of
my quarters. She didn't say another word, she just started walking here
and each step became more and more difficult. <br>

malfunction. <br>
LAL: Father. <br>
DATA: Yes, Lal. I am here. <br>
PICARD: A malfunction. Emotional awareness. <br>
DATA: It appears to be a symptom of cascade failure. It would require
initialisation the base matrix without wiping out the higher functions.
<br>
HAFTEL: I agree. May I assist? <br>

HAFTEL: If you'll excuse us, Commander Data and I have much to do. <br>

then another. His hands were moving faster than I could see, trying to
