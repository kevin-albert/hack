Captain's log, stardate 45376.3. We are approaching the planet Bilana
Three, where a new method of propulsion known as the Soliton Wave is
being developed. The Enterprise has been asked to participate in one of
the first tests of this new technology.

going to witness a moment in history. <br>
DATA: Every nanosecond in this continuum is a moment in history, once
it has elapsed. <br>
LAFORGE: No, no, no, no. I mean, we're going to see something that
people will talk about for years. I mean, think about it. No more bulky
warp engines or nacelles. A ship just generates a Soliton wave and then
rides it through space like a surfboard. This is going to be like being
there to watch Chuck Yeager break the sound barrier, or Zephram
Cochrane engage the first warp drive. <br>
DATA: It should be interesting. <br>
WORF: Very exciting. <br>
LAFORGE: I'm talking to the wrong crowd. Donaldson! Donaldson, you're
an engineer. <br>

CREWWOMAN [OC]: Lieutenant Worf, you have a subspace communication from
the transport ship Milan. <br>
WORF: Transfer the signal to this station. <br>
HELENA [on monitor]: Hello, Worf. <br>
WORF: Mother. <br>
HELENA [on monitor]: I hope you don't mind us dropping in on you like
this, but when I heard the Enterprise was to be in this sector, we took
the first transport and here we are. <br>
WORF: Is father with you? <br>
HELENA [on monitor]: No, but I brought Alexander with me. I thought the
two of you would like a chance to visit. <br>
WORF: Very well. I will make arrangements for you to come aboard. <br>

WORF: Mother. We need to talk about Alexander. <br>
HELENA: Alexander is a fine boy, Worf. He's smart and he's
high-spirited. Like you were at that age. Sometimes, when he comes
running through the house and knocks over that big green lamp, just
like you used to do. <br>
WORF: I don't remember you smiling when I knocked over that lamp. <br>
HELENA: Well maybe once, when you weren't looking. When we learned
Alexander was to come to live with us, we were so happy. The house had
been so empty since you left, and we thought here is our chance to fill
it with the sound of children again. But the truth is, Worf, your
father and I, we're getting old. <br>
WORF: Mother, you both have many years <br>
HELENA: I don't mean we're ready for the grave. Not yet, anyway. But
we're a little less active. It's harder for us to keep up with
Alexander. We're ready to be just grandparents. Alexander needs to be
with his father. <br>
WORF: Mother, that is not possible. We must find another option. <br>
HELENA: He needs his father, Worf. Alexander's, he's having
difficulties. <br>
WORF: Difficulties? <br>
HELENA: He's disobedient. <br>
WORF: Mother, Klingon children are often difficult to control. <br>
HELENA: I do know something about how Klingon children behave. It's not
just his willful attitude. He doesn't always tell the truth. <br>
WORF: My son is a liar? <br>
HELENA: He is a boy, Worf, and boys sometimes take the wrong path. They
need guidance. He needs a father, his father, to give him that
guidance. I have to leave soon. The transport will be leaving for
Earth. You must do what you think is best for him. That's all a parent
can hope to do.

JA'DAR: Twenty three field coils, working in concert, will generate the
soliton wave from this point on the planet surface.
We will have our test ship towed to a position approximately two
million kilometres from Bilana Three. If our theories are correct, the
wave will envelop the ship and push it into warp. <br>
PICARD: Warp without warp drive. <br>
RIKER: They're going to put you out of a job, Geordi. <br>
LAFORGE: I hope so, Commander. <br>
DATA: Doctor Ja'Dar, how closely will the Enterprise need to follow the
test vehicle? <br>
JA'DAR: The soliton emits a great deal of subspace radio interference.
You'll need to remain within twenty kilometres in order to receive
telemetry. <br>
PICARD: Doctor, how will you end the experiment? <br>
JA'DAR: The wave will be directed toward Lemma Two, about three light
years distance. Our sister facility there which will generate a
scattering field which will dissipate the wave and bring the ship out
of warp. I'll be sending you more detailed operational plans within the
hour. <br>

KYLE: As the value of their horns increased, the number of white rhinos
in the wild kept falling, until they finally became extinct about two
centuries ago. Now, I'd like to show you a pair of animals we're trying
to save from extinction. Would you follow me? They're from Corvan Two,
where their homes in the rainforests are being threatened by industrial
pollutants. They're called Corvan gilvos. They're a little shy. <br>

KYLE: The eating habits of gilvos are very similar to those of Earth's
Draco lizards, which died out over three hundred years ago. There
are only fourteen gilvos left on Corvan Two. We're transplanting these
two to the protected planet Brentalia, where they should thrive. Well,
why don't you all have a look around on your own for a while. If you
have any questions, please feel free to ask. <br>

on the tables were for everyone to play with. So I guess you didn't
know you weren't supposed to take them. I saw you playing with the
lizard model a little while ago. Do you still have it? <br>

you stole, and yet you did! Alexander, come here. When I was a child,
younger than you, I lost my parents, my family, my people. Everything I
had was taken from me except my sense of honour. It was the one thing I
had which was truly Klingon and which no one could take away. Do you
know who they are? <br>

after K'Ehleyr's death. In a way, he not only lost his mother, he lost
his father as well. <br>
WORF: Are you saying that his misconduct is a result of feeling
abandoned? <br>
TROI: It's possible. Children don't have the experience to handle
emotional crises. Instead of dealing with their feelings, they act on
them. Tell me about the last time you spoke with K'Ehleyr, the night
she died. <br>
WORF: We argued. <br>
TROI: What about? <br>
WORF: Alexander. About how she did not tell me about him when he was
born. <br>
TROI: So you were angry with her? <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
TROI: Are you still angry with her? <br>
WORF: Of course not. <br>
TROI: It would be very normal to be angry with her. Angry because she
died and left you alone with a son you never knew you had. Being angry
doesn't mean you loved her any less, Worf, but you can't hide from your
feelings, just as Alexander cannot hide from his. You both have a lot
of healing to do. Perhaps you should think about doing it together.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Report. <br>
LAFORGE: The soliton wave has continued to increase in <br>
(Worf enters) <br>
WORF: Excuse me. <br>
LAFORGE: The soliton wave has continued to increase in power. Its
energy level has risen by a factor of ninety six. At its current rate
of acceleration, the wave should hit the planet in a couple of hours. <br>
PICARD: How do we stop it? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, there are two possibilities. We could attempt to use our
own warp engines to generate an inverse-resonance wave. If we could
match the exact frequency and amplitude of the soliton, we should be
able to neutralise it. <br>
RIKER: You don't sound very confident. <br>
DATA: Because the soliton is constantly changing in both frequency and
amplitude, it will be extremely difficult to achieve an exact match. <br>
PICARD: Let's hear the second option. <br>
LAFORGE: It's a little more dangerous, but I think there's a better
chance for success. We could create a backfire, an explosive force set
off just in front of the soliton wave. A large enough explosion, say
five photon torpedoes, should be enough to disrupt the wave and allow
it to dissipate. <br>
PICARD: How fast is the wave travelling now? <br>
DATA: Warp six point three seven. <br>
LAFORGE: The good news is we can catch it. The bad news is that in
order to set up this backfire we have to be in front of it.&nbsp;<br>
DATA: Which would require the Enterprise to go through the wave. <br>
RIKER: Why can't we go around it? <br>
DATA: The wave has been growing in size as well as power. There is
insufficient time remaining for us to circumvent it before it reaches
Lemma Two. <br>
PICARD: How much protection will the shields provide if we attempt to
penetrate the wave? <br>
WORF: The shields have not been fully restored. Shield strength is down
to thirty three percent. <br>
RIKER: It's going to be quite a ride. <br>
PICARD: It's a better choice. Lay in a course for the soliton wave. </font></p>
