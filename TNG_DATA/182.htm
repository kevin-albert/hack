RIKER: Beverly? <br>
CRUSHER: Will. You remember me. That's good. What else do you remember,
Captain? <br>
RIKER: Captain? <br>
(He catches sight of his reflection. There's a little grey in the
beard) <br>
(After the opening titles) <br>
CRUSHER: Water, three Celsius. How do you feel? <br>
RIKER: Confused. <br>
CRUSHER: That's understandable, considering what's happened. <br>
RIKER: What has happened? What happened to Sickbay? To you? To me? <br>
CRUSHER: Sit down, Captain. <br>
RIKER: Captain? I am Commander William T Riker. What is going on here? <br>
CRUSHER: Sit. Please. What is the last thing that you remember clearly?
<br>
RIKER: Alpha Onias three. The Enterprise had been probed. Geordi, Worf,
and I transported down to track the source. <br>
CRUSHER: But all you found there was toxic gas. They barely had time to
get the three of you out. Will, that happened sixteen years ago. <br>
RIKER: That's not possible. <br>
CRUSHER: With an Altarian virus, anything is possible. In fact, we've
been expecting this. <br>
RIKER: Could you be more specific? <br>
CRUSHER: That day on Onias three, you were infected with a strain of
Altarian encephalitis, a retrovirus that incorporates its DNA directly
into the cells of its host. It can lie dormant for many years and then
suddenly become active again, as it did in your case ten days ago. You
have been in a coma, delirious. Your fever finally broke this morning. <br>
(really? So why is he in uniform and not sickbay gown?) <br>
RIKER: But what happened to my memory? <br>
CRUSHER: Let me show you a scan of your brain tissue. When the
encephalitis became active it caused widespread synapse degradation,
interrupting the consolidation of your memory patterns. <br>
RIKER: Doctor. <br>
CRUSHER: Will, this virus inevitably causes memory loss back to the
moment of the original infection. In your case, all the way back to
Alpha Onias three. <br>
RIKER: I don't believe this. Is this a dream? <br>
CRUSHER: Feel my hand. It is flesh and bone. This is not a dream and
you are, in fact, Captain William T. Riker in command of the
Enterprise. <br>
RIKER: The Enterprise. For how long? <br>
CRUSHER: Nine years. <br>
RIKER: If I have lost my memory, how do I get it back? <br>
CRUSHER: Memories are formed by association. Smells, sounds, and images
from the present could possibly trigger them. <br>
RIKER: Like a song reminds you of an old friend. <br>
CRUSHER: Exactly. In associational therapy, we expose the patient to
familiar surroundings. This could stimulate the brain's neural synapses
into regenerating. <br>
RIKER: Then let's get started. There's nothing more familiar than the
Enterprise. Maybe that'll bring back some <br>
CRUSHER: Will, I said your memory could return. In many of these cases
the damage is permanent.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: What about Geordi and Worf? Were they
infected too? <br>
CRUSHER: Thankfully, no. Geordi appears to have been immune and the
Klingons don't seem to be affected by the virus. <br>
RIKER: Speaking of Klingons <br>
CRUSHER: There've been quite a few changes on the Enterprise in the
last sixteen years.

going to jog my memory. Main Bridge. <br>

of relatively simple negotiations, and the treaty will be signed. <br>

PICARD: Sorry. I'll start at the beginning, which is four years ago. A
Romulan battle cruiser strayed into Federation space. Its warp coils
had collapsed, life support was failing. <br>
TROI: You saved them, Will, you and the Enterprise. <br>
PICARD: The Romulans were impressed, to say the least. After years of
distrust and conflict, they started to talk. You were our key spokesman
in securing the alliance with the Romulans. <br>

Romulan Ambassador to the final session. <br>

Romulans or with anyone else. <br>

OGAWA: Good as new, Captain. You can take him home. <br>
RIKER: Thanks. How's the arm? <br>
JEAN LUC: It's fine. Dad, I'm really sorry. I mean, I know you've got
more important things to do. <br>

JEAN-LUC: It's okay, Dad. <br>
RIKER: No, okay's not good enough. When I was your age, my own father
he wasn't there for me. And I really needed him. I've often wondered
what kind of father I'd be. I never felt quite ready. The idea even
scared me a little. <br>
JEAN-LUC: Scared? You? <br>
RIKER: Yeah. But I guess I got over it. You're here. Resume. It's
important to me that I don't let you down, Jean-Luc. <br>
JEAN-LUC: You never have, Dad. You've always been there for me. <br>
RIKER: I'll have to take your word for that because I don't remember
any of it. Your first step, your first tooth, nothing. And I want to
remember. I guess there's only one thing we can do. We've got to build
some new memories. </font></p>

but I used to have a great fishing

JEAN-LUC: The Curtis Creek programme? <br>

JEAN-LUC: Sure. We've gone to Curtis Creek lots of times. <br>
RIKER: Would you like to go again? <br>
JEAN-LUC: You bet. <br>

you fell in. <br>

JEAN-LUC: Mom really liked Curtis Creek. We went there for picnics and
stuff lots of times. <br>
RIKER: What was she like? <br>
JEAN-LUC: She was great. I think of her a lot. I'd better go change. <br>

LAFORGE: I've had to shut down the warp engines, Captain. <br>
RIKER: Why? <br>
LAFORGE: Antimatter containment fields are fluctuating. It's nothing to
worry about though. <br>
RIKER: We're on the edge of the Neutral Zone on impulse power, and
you're not concerned? <br>
LAFORGE: I'll have the engines back online in no time, sir. <br>
RIKER: Like you tracked down that faulty processing accelerator? <br>
LAFORGE: I'm running a level one diagnostic. <br>
RIKER: For thirty hours? It would never take you more than four. You're
incapable of that level of incompetence, Mister La Forge. Worf, where
did you get that scar? <br>
WORF: In combat. <br>
RIKER: What battle? When? Which sector? Which unit? Mister Data, if we
left immediately, when would we arrive at Outpost twenty three? <br>
DATA: (thinks) At warp one, in three days, four hours. <br>
RIKER: How about at warp seven? (pause) At warp eight? At warp nine?
What's the matter, Data? What happened to those millions of
calculations per second? <br>
DATA: Pardon me, sir. I am experiencing subspace interference which
limits my abilities. I can't operate as quickly as <br>

RIKER: No! That's not what you said. You said I can't. You used a
contraction, didn't you? <br>
DATA: Sir, I can explain if you would just give me a moment. <br>
RIKER: No you can't. Don't even try. <br>
(Picard, Troi and Tomalak have come out of the ready room) <br>
PICARD: Captain, perhaps it would be best if we discussed this <br>
RIKER: Shut up! <br>
PICARD: I beg your pardon? <br>
RIKER: I said, shut up. As in close your mouth and stop talking. <br>
TROI: Will, I sense how upset you are. You're angry and impatient. <br>

RIKER: The Enterprise? my son you created it all. <br>
TOMALAK: With the help of our neural scanners and what you would call a
holodeck. Now, please tell me. How did you discover the truth? The
future we constructed for you should have been convincing. <br>
RIKER: It wasn't. There was a computer time lag, for one thing. <br>
TOMALAK: Unavoidable. Our scanners have a limited response time, so
whenever you strayed from our expectations. But surely that was not
enough to <br>
RIKER: To smash your house of cards? No. It was the visual record of my
wife, Minuet. Bad move. <br>
TOMALAK: But we chose someone from your past who is still alive. A
woman you were extremely attracted to <br>
RIKER: Your mistake, Tomalak. Minuet was nothing more than a computer
generated fantasy I once experienced on another holodeck. <br>
TOMALAK: Impossible. In your mind that woman exists, physically. Your
feelings toward her remain quite passionate. <br>
RIKER: She was part of a very special programme. <br>
TOMALAK: So much effort, so little accomplished. <br>
RIKER: If it was Outpost twenty three you were after, why didn't you
use your neural scanners to probe my mind? <br>
TOMALAK: Our scanners are calibrated for Romulan brain patterns. When
it comes to human brains, they are less efficient. There were gaps in
the information we gathered from your memory. <br>
RIKER: Gaps? From what I saw, I find that hard to believe. You
recreated the Enterprise, the crew, every nuance and smell, sound, with
perfect accurate. I didn't see any gaps. I don't buy it, Tomalak. <br>
TOMALAK: We're wasting time. Bring him.

were less than a kilometre from this base. Your capture was a simple

trust me. Easy, I'm not going to hurt you. Who are you? How did you get
here? My name is Will. <br>
ETHAN: Ethan. They brought me here with my parents. We were at a
research station on Miridian six. <br>
RIKER: Miridian six? On the edge of the Neutral Zone? I thought that
was uninhabited. <br>
ETHAN: The station was set up last year. Then the Romulans came. <br>
RIKER: It's odd that the Enterprise wasn't advised. Where are your
parents now? <br>
ETHAN: They took them away. <br>
RIKER: Do you know why the Romulans are keeping you here? <br>
ETHAN: No. I just want to get away. <br>
RIKER: I'll get us out of here, Ethan. <br>
ETHAN: How? Even if we do get away, they'll find us. They found me when
I escaped before. <br>
RIKER: You escaped? <br>
ETHAN: Yes. I hid in a secret place for weeks, but they caught me when
I came out to find food. <br>
(Tomalak and a guard storm back in) <br>
TOMALAK: I want that information, Commander. I want the location of
Outpost twenty three. Very well. I have been given permission to use
whatever means are necessary <br>

ETHAN: After I got away last time, I mapped out all their tunnels.
Supply depot, communications, living quarters and shuttlebay. <br>
RIKER: How many guards in the shuttlebay? <br>
ETHAN: Only two or three. <br>
RIKER: If we stole a shuttlecraft, that would get us nowhere. The
Romulans could follow their own ship to easily. But if we broke into
their communications system, we could send a message to the Enterprise.
<br>
ETHAN: We can't do that. The transmitter is on a voice-activated
security system. <br>
RIKER: Do you know whose voice activates it? <br>
ETHAN: Only Ambassador Tomalak. <br>

ETHAN: Tomalak. <br>
RIKER: Ambassador Tomalak? Tomalak is a Romulan Captain. The only time
he was ever called Ambassador was in a holodeck fantasy. How do you
know about that? <br>
