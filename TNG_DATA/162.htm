completed its survey of Doctor Apgar's work and is ready to return to
the ship. <br>
PICARD: Good. Please. And feel free to examine the work of the other
students too. <br>
DATA: Ensign Williams' striking style is heavily influenced by
geometric constructivism. <br>

surrealists with the irrationality of Dadaism. <br>
(Then back to Picard's tall canvas) <br>
DATA: Interesting. <br>
PICARD: Oh, thank you. In what way? <br>
DATA: While suggesting the free treatment of form usually attributed to
Fauvism, this quite inappropriately attempts to
juxtapose the disparate cubistic styles of Picasso and Leger. In
addition, the use of colour suggests a haphazard
melange of clashing styles. Furthermore, the unsettling overtones of
proto-Vulcan influences <br>

William Riker. <br>
KRAG: Commander Riker, I am here to take you into custody. <br>
RIKER: Custody? On what charge? <br>
KRAG: Suspicion of murder. <br>

PICARD: Chief Investigator, we are perfectly willing to cooperate with
you, but <br>

KRAG: Two witnesses have come forward to describe Commander Riker's
threats against Doctor Apgar. <br>
PICARD: Threats? I'm aware there was a private conversation between
them. <br>
KRAG: Apparently, it was much more than just a private conversation,
but he will have a chance to prove his innocence. <br>
PICARD: Investigator, in our system of jurisprudence, a man is innocent
until proved guilty. <br>
KRAG: In ours, he is guilty until he is proved innocent, and you are
under our jurisdiction. If I understand the Federation
regulations on these matters, and I just happened to look them up
before I <br>
PICARD: I am aware of Federation regulations, sir, and if you
investigate them further, you will find the captain decides if
extradition is warranted. <br>
KRAG: Are you saying it is not? <br>
PICARD: I'm saying, if there is sufficient cause to warrant a trial, I
will release my officer into your custody. <br>
KRAG: Would you say you're close to your First Officer, Captain? <br>
PICARD: That question is irrelevant here. <br>
KRAG: Really, Captain, you cannot believe that. How can I expect a fair
and impartial decision? <br>
PICARD: I must protect the rights of my officer. <br>
KRAG: I can appreciate that, but you will do it on the planet, not
here. After all, what if you were suddenly to decide to leave this star
system? <br>
PICARD: You have my word as a Starfleet officer that I will not. <br>
KRAG: Unacceptable. Captain, you will turn him over to me for
interrogation now. <br>
PICARD: Interrogate him here. <br>
KRAG: We must recreate, step by step, moment by moment, all the events
leading to the explosion. We will require access to all the witnesses,
as well as the data from the lab's ground computers. It would be
impossible to accomplish here. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps not. Mister Data, will you report to my Ready Room? <br>
DATA [OC]: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: We may be able to assist you in recreating the events. <br>
(Data enters) <br>
PICARD: Commander Data, this is Chief Investigator Krag. Commander, by
taking testimony from the away team and from witnesses provided by the
Investigator, would it be possible to programme the Holodeck to
recreate what happened on the science station? <br>
DATA: It would require construction and design specifications, full
orthographic representations of the Krieger equipment, as well as
visual representations and voice analyses of the persons involved. But
it is possible. <br>
KRAG: Very well. Arrangements will be made to provide you with all
available information. I shall return shortly with our witnesses. <br>
PICARD: Commander, will you escort Investigator Krag to Transporter
Room Three.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Ensign Crusher, Mister La Forge, we are
going to recreate the research station here on the holodeck. I want you
to work with Commander Data on the preparations. In addition, Commander
La Forge and Commander Riker, I want you to give the computer detailed
depositions of everything you saw, everything you heard while you were
on board. Counsellor, I want you to assist me during this inquiry. My
decision about the extradition will be based upon the evidence
presented during these recreations. <br>
RIKER: Captain, may I have a word with you? <br>

inappropriate.

One? <br>
RIKER: Just this. I'm not a murderer. I went to the Tanugan lab as an
official representative of Starfleet. I acted
accordingly. I was there to evaluate Doctor Apgar's progress in the
development of a Krieger Wave converter. That's all I was interested
in. Computer. Load deposition programme Riker one. Run the simulation. <br>

Geordi La Forge. <br>

for some refreshments. <br>

started, so are we. <br>
APGAR: Of course I'm prepared. <br>
RIKER: All right, why don't you give me the overview of your research
while Mister La Forge and your assistant take a look at the
experimental data. <br>
APGAR: Fine, whatever. I must say, Commander, I resent this early
arrival. Starfleet will get its converter. I've had a few setbacks,
that's all. <br>
RIKER: We're not here to pressure you, Doctor. We just want an update
on your progress. <br>
APGAR: Tayna, show the Commander's assistant whatever he wants to see.
Give him full access to our records. <br>
TAYNA: Yes, Doctor. If you'll come with me. Our lambda field generator
is on the planet since it requires a minimum of five thousand
kilometres for the field to collimate. <br>
(Tayna and Geordi move to the back of the set. Manua has been gazing at
Riker all the time) <br>

scheduled for another three months. <br>
RIKER: We were in this sector on another mission, and since you had
already contacted Starfleet about additional dicosilium, it seemed like
a good opportunity. <br>
MANUA: How interesting. Tell us about this other mission. <br>
RIKER: It's just a study of a proto-star cloud. The Enterprise'll be
back tomorrow. <br>
APGAR: The Enterprise just left you here? <br>
RIKER: We didn't want to inconvenience you. We've made arrangements for

misunderstanding of the worst kind. We could straighten the entire
thing out if you would ask Mrs. Apgar to join us. <br>
APGAR: My wife and my assistant have transported down to the planet.

justification for all the extra dicosilium I've requested? That is why
they sent you early, isn't it? <br>

KRAG: And you have nothing further to add, Commander? Nothing about
firing a phaser? <br>
RIKER: I never fired a phaser on the science station. <br>
KRAG: That's odd. Very odd. Captain Picard, is it not true that your
sensors detected an energy drain just as Commander Riker began
transport? <br>
PICARD: That's correct. <br>
KRAG: Have you been able to explain it? <br>
PICARD: Not to my knowledge. <br>
KRAG: We have. Our readings are quite clear about it. Information
retrieved from the lab's ground computers indicate that a focused
energy pulse was fired just as Commander Riker began transport.
Furthermore, by analysing the angle and trajectory, we have determined
that it came from the very spot Commander Riker was standing. So then,
will you allow me to show you
my recreation of the end of this story? A speculation, if you will.

There's another answer. We're just not seeing it. <br>

you looked at her? I'm not the fool you take me for. <br>

the stomach in return) <br>
APGAR: You won't get away with this. Your career is over. I'll see to
it. I swear I will, Riker. <br>
RIKER: If you report this, you'll be making a terrible mistake, Doctor.
A terrible mistake. <br>
(Apgar and Manua leave) <br>
KRAG: Freeze programme. <br>
MANUA: Your career was safe. He was a scientist. In another day some
fascinating bit of technical trivia would have distracted him. He would
have forgotten about you and his complaint to Starfleet. Excuse me. <br>
(Manua leaves the holodeck) <br>
PICARD: We'll, um, we'll take a short recess. <br>
(Picard and Krag leave) <br>
RIKER: Why would she lie like that? She was lying. You could tell. <br>
TROI: Will, I didn't sense any deception from her. <br>
RIKER: Then you think that I? <br>
TROI: No! No, of course not. I know you. You don't have to convince me
of anything. <br>
RIKER: We can't both be telling the truth. <br>
TROI: It is the truth as each of you remembers it. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Chief Inspector, we've watched the events
replayed over and over again and I am impressed, and admittedly
dismayed by the body of evidence against Commander Riker. But isn't it
remarkable that with all the witnesses, all the different points of
view of the events aboard the space station, we haven't seen what
really happened? <br>
KRAG: I do not understand. <br>
PICARD: Allow me, with the help of Mister La Forge, to explain.
Computer, load Manua programme one, time index fourteen four one. Play
programme. <br>
APGAR: Fine. Whatever. Starfleet will get its Krieger wave converter.
These things take time. I've had a few setbacks, that's all. <br>
PICARD: Freeze. Mrs. Apgar, this was from your deposition. It would
seem to suggest that your husband had failed to create Krieger waves. <br>
MANUA: Yes, but he was very close to a breakthrough. <br>
PICARD: He said he needed more time. He was upset by our early arrival.
But in fact I maintain he already had made that breakthrough and that
he was lying to us. <br>
KRAG: On what basis? <br>
LAFORGE: For the last several hours, the Enterprise has been
experiencing unusual radiation bursts. We've identified them as Krieger
waves. <br>
TAYNA: Krieger waves? But that's impossible. From where? <br>
LAFORGE: From right here. Inside the holodeck. <br>
PICARD: We recreated your science lab in every conceivable detail.
Essentially, what was in the original lab is here. <br>
LAFORGE: Including the Krieger wave converter that Doctor Apgar claimed
didn't work. Except it does work. <br>
PICARD: Your field generator on the planet surface has been sending out
harmless energy charges, which this facsimile has been converting into
Krieger waves. <br>
RIKER: But the holodeck can't create anything dangerous. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, it didn't. When you get down to basics, the converter is
nothing more than a complex series of mirrors and reflective coils. The
energy from the field generator down on the planet simply reflects off
of elements in the convertor which turns it into highly focused Krieger
waves. <br>
PICARD: And those same waves have been randomly striking different
areas of our ship as we orbit the planet and our angle to the generator
changes. <br>
KRAG: Why would Apgar lie about his success? <br>
PICARD: Computer, run Manua programme one, time code, fourteen three
eight.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Holodeck - Space Station Living quarters]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">APGAR: Manua, someday I'll be able reward you for
all your patience. I'll get you everything you ever dreamed of. <br>
MANUA: I have all the reward I need. <br>
PICARD: Freeze programme. Run Riker programme two, time code, sixteen

RIKER: To your success, doctor. <br>
MANUA: And the rewards that come with it.<br>
PICARD: Freeze. <br>
MANUA: I never said that. <br>
PICARD: Nevertheless, it seems clear that your husband was motivated to
earn the kind of rewards that pleased you, Mrs. Apgar. <br>
MANUA: What's wrong with that? <br>
TROI: Well, he wouldn't have earned great profits from his dealings
with Starfleet. We were only interested in a new power source. <br>
LAFORGE: But if he could turn this into a weapon it would be worth a
lot to the Romulans, the Ferengi and a few others. Now Doctor Apgar had
been ordering extra dicosilium for months. That's a pretty good
indication that he was trying to create larger reflective coils. <br>
PICARD: And when the away team arrived early he must have been worried
that Starfleet was becoming suspicious. He needed more time to finish
his work. Apgar said that each of the three versions. No doubt, he was
afraid that Commander Riker might
learn the truth and cut off his support prematurely. Discovering
Commander Riker with his wife didn't help matters.
I submit that he decided to murder Commander Riker. <br>

TAYNA: Activating the generator on the planet. <br>
PICARD: Why would he do that? <br>
TAYNA: Maybe he was going to work on the converter, I don't know. <br>
PICARD: Maybe he was already thinking ahead to his next confrontation
with Commander Riker. Computer, play Riker programme four, time index
twenty four one. <br>
APGAR: What are you going to put in your report, Riker? That there's no
justification for all the extra
dicosilium I've requested? That is why they sent you early, isn't it? <br>
RIKER: Doctor. <br>
APGAR: I can explain why I needed it. They have no idea what my
problems are. There are explanations for all of it. <br>
RIKER: I don't need explanations. <br>
PICARD: Freeze. To Apgar, this must have seemed as though Commander
Riker were confirming his worst fears. And I believe it was now that he
decided finally to kill him. <br>
KRAG: You forget, Picard, we know the energy pulse which blew up the
reactor originated from Commander Riker's position, not Doctor Apgar's.
<br>
LAFORGE: We are hypothesising that Doctor Apgar energised the converter
at the moment of Commander Riker's beam-out, hoping to make his death
look like a transporter accident. But something went wrong. The energy
pulse hit the transporter beam and reflected back to the reactor, which
caused the explosion. <br>
KRAG: An interesting hypothesis. But impossible to prove. <br>
LAFORGE: Not really. We know that the field generator on the planet has
been repeating a discharge ever since the explosion. The intervals are
like clockwork, except the explosion occurred point zero zero one four
seconds after the initial discharge. And the only explanation for that
variance is the time it would take the energy pulse to bounce back from
the transporter beam to the reactor. <br>
PICARD: We've arranged a demonstration to illustrate. Mister La Forge,
I think it's about time, isn't it? <br>
LAFORGE: Computer, load programme, La Forge one. Coordinate auto-engage
time sequence. The next discharge from the field generator is scheduled
to occur in just a few moments, and we've aligned the holodeck
programme to recreate the final events as Commander Riker described
them. Only this time our facsimile will automatically process the
energy charge from the planet and reflect it just as the original
convertor did before the explosion. <br>
PICARD: If we're correct, we'll know it instantly. <br>
COMPUTER: Auto-engage time sequence synchronised. <br>
APGAR: Then we have nothing further to say to each other. <br>
RIKER: I'll tell my Captain to expect your grievance. <br>
APGAR: Do that. <br>
RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave, now. <br>
