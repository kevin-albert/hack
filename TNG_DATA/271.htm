OGAWA: So why were you rolling around in Cypirion cactus? <br>
RIKER: You know Rebecca Smith? <br>
OGAWA: The new Tactical officer? <br>
RIKER: We took a walk in the Arboretum. We sat down, we got
comfortable, things got a little romantic, and then I rolled over. <br>
(Riker has wicked long spines sticking out of his back. Ogawa starts
pulling them out.) <br>
BARCLAY: Blurred vision, dizziness, palpitations, a stinging sensation
in the lower spine. It's Terrelian Death Syndrome, isn't it. <br>
CRUSHER: I thought we agreed you'd come to me before checking Starfleet
Medical Database. <br>
BARCLAY: Yes, well, this time I'm glad I did. Maybe we can stop the
cellular decay before it's too late. <br>
CRUSHER: Reg, you don't have Terrelian Death Syndrome. <br>
BARCLAY: You, you're sure? <br>
CRUSHER: I'm sure. <br>
BARCLAY: (scans himself) Then maybe it is Symbalene blood burn. <br>
CRUSHER: No, no. I don't see anything wrong with you at all. Wait a
minute, there is a slight imbalance in your K three cell count. <br>
BARCLAY: My K threes? Oh, no. <br>
CRUSHER: Barclay, I'm sure it's nothing. Look, I'll run a microcellular
scan. We'll see. This'll take a couple of minutes. <br>
(enter Data carrying something in his arms) <br>
CRUSHER: How's my smallest patient doing? <br>
DATA: I believe she is doing well. Her appetite has increased by seven
percent, and she is starting to engage in prenatal behaviour. <br>
(Spot is put down on a biobed) <br>
CRUSHER: Oh, she's getting close. You'll have a fresh litter of hungry
kittens before the week is over. Let me just run an amniotic scan to
make sure everything's fine and then I'll <br>
BARCLAY: Doctor! My capillaries are shrinking! <br>
CRUSHER: Excuse me. Alyssa, can you take care of Spot for a minute?
Start a preliminary amniotic scan. <br>
OGAWA: Yes, Doctor. <br>
BARCLAY: My intravascular pressure, it's going right through the roof. <br>
CRUSHER: You're right, it is elevated. You've also got heightened
electrophoretic activity. <br>
BARCLAY: Electrophoretic activity? Is it serious? <br>
CRUSHER: Well, based on this, I'd say you've got seventy, maybe eighty
years. <br>
BARCLAY: Eighty? Eighty years? <br>
CRUSHER: Yes, Reg. What you've got a mild case of Urodelan Flu. It's
nothing serious. Most humans have a natural immunity to it, but the
T-cell in your DNA that would normally fight off the infection is
dormant. <br>
BARCLAY: So you mean I have bad genes? <br>
CRUSHER: You have one dormant gene out of a hundred thousand, and I can
activate that gene with a synthetic T-cell let the body attack the
infection naturally. You should feel better in a couple of days. <br>
BARCLAY: Thank you, Doctor. I feel much better. <br>
CRUSHER: Good. Now, stay away from Medical Database. (to Riker) And you
stay out of the Arboretum. <br>
OGAWA: Everything looks fine, Data. Do you want to know the sex of the
kittens? <br>
DATA: I have noticed that many humans prefer not to know in order to
experience the surprise during birth. I believe I will preserve the
mystery until then. <br>
OGAWA: I know what you mean. I don't want to know either. <br>
CRUSHER: Alyssa? <br>
OGAWA: Spot's not the only one who's going to be a mother. <br>
CRUSHER: Oh, Alyssa, that's wonderful! How did Andrew take the news? <br>
OGAWA: He was a little shocked, but he's getting over it. <br>
DATA: I have spent the past nine weeks as an expectant parent. I would
be happy to share my insights with your husband. If my experience is
any indication, he will need all the help he can get. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 47653.2. We're performing
field tests of our new tactical systems and weapon upgrades. Mister
Worf is supervising the exercises.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: The next test will involve the new photon
torpedoes. The explosive yield has been increased by eleven percent and
I have enhanced the targeting system for increased accuracy. <br>
PICARD: Sounds fascinating, Mister Worf. Please proceed. <br>
WORF: Setting targeting coordinates zero zero five mark three one
seven, spread pattern delta nine four. Torpedoes armed and loaded, sir.
<br>
PICARD: Fire when ready. <br>
(only two of the three find their targets in the asteroid belt) <br>
RIKER: Worf? <br>
WORF: One of the torpedoes has veered off course. It appears to be a
malfunction in the guidance system. <br>
PICARD: Abort and destroy. <br>
WORF: The torpedo is not responding. Subspace detonator will not
engage. <br>
RIKER: Lock on phasers. <br>
WORF: The torpedo is out of range. <br>
RIKER: Even for your newly improved phasers? <br>
PICARD: Maintain a sensor lock on the torpedo, Mister Worf. We'll have
to go after it. <br>
DATA: That would be inadvisable, sir. The asteroid field is unusually
dense. The Enterprise is too large to safely navigate through it. <br>
PICARD: Then I'll take a shuttlecraft and retrieve it. Mister Data,
you're with me. <br>
RIKER: Captain, the shuttle pilot who's on duty is Lieutenant Hayes. <br>
PICARD: I happen to be a reasonably qualified pilot, Number One.
Besides, these tests hardly require the Captain's personal attention. <br>
RIKER: Understood. Enjoy yourself. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, I think that you should consider analysing your
new guidance system. <br>
DATA: Captain, I will need a few minutes to attend to a personal
matter.

and me to complete our mission. I would prefer to have a human present
to supervise the birthing process. <br>
BARCLAY: Well, I'd be honoured. <br>
DATA: I have noticed that you are the only other member of the crew
whom Spot seems to like. <br>
BARCLAY: Really? That's hard to believe. You're such a sweet little
kitty. <br>
DATA: She is to you. However, there have been several injuries to other
members of the crew who have attempted to care for her. <br>
BARCLAY: So, has she picked a place? <br>
DATA: A place? <br>
BARCLAY: Cats usually like to pick a specific location to give birth.
It's usually dark and secluded, and I believe this is it. <br>
(Barclay drops Spot down behind a chair) <br>
BARCLAY: I'm curious, sir. Who's the father? <br>

occasions and there are twelve male felines on board. I intend to run a
full DNA analysis on the kittens once they <br>

can find nothing wrong with the guidance system. <br>

It was my fault. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: This tranquilliser should keep him
unconscious for another seven hours. What have you found out? <br>
DATA: I have analysed Commander Riker's DNA structure. A synthetic
T-cell has invaded his genetic codes. This T-cell has begun to activate
his latent introns. <br>
PICARD: Introns? <br>
DATA: They are genetic codes which are normally dormant. They are
evolutionary holdovers, sequences of DNA that provided key behavioural
and physical characteristics millions of years ago, but are no longer
necessary. For instance, Counsellor Troi's gill slits and other
amphibious characteristics were derived from introns which still
contain amphibious codes. <br>
PICARD: So these introns are causing her DNA to re-combine in an
earlier configuration? <br>
DATA: That is correct. In her case, the DNA has created an amphibious
lifeform which became extinct over fifty million years ago. <br>
PICARD: And Commander Riker's introns are changing him into what
appears to be one of the earlier hominids. <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. I would say Australopithecine. Each of these stages is
another link in the evolutionary chain which stretches back to the
origins of all lifeforms on Earth. Because introns can include genetic
material from many different species over millions of years of
evolution, it is possible that a wide variety of transformations is
occurring among the crew. <br>
PICARD: What about those crewmembers who are not from Earth? <br>
DATA: All humanoid life has a similar genetic pattern. The virus should
work on non-human crewmembers in the same way. They are each
de-evolving to earlier forms of life on their homeworlds. I feel I must
inform you, sir, you have also been infected by the intron virus. <br>
PICARD: How long before I begin to change? <br>
DATA: According to my calculations, within the next twelve hours, you
will begin to exhibit the first signs of your eventual transformation. <br>
PICARD: And what will that be&nbsp; <br>
DATA: I believe you will also de-evolve into some form of early
primate. Possibly similar to a lemur, or a pygmy marmoset.<br>
PICARD: Well, before I begin swinging through the ship looking for
breakfast, we'd better find some answers. How do we reverse the
process? <br>
DATA: I am uncertain. We will need to run several microcellular scans.
However, the ship's main computer has been damaged. Captain, the
computer in my quarters has an independent processing and memory
storage unit. It should not be affected. I suggest we start from there.
<br>
PICARD: Agreed.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(mewing sound) <br>
DATA: It would appear that Spot has had her kittens. <br>
PICARD: They sound hungry. <br>
DATA: Yes. I am curious as to why Spot is not caring for them. <br>
(it's because on the carpet is an iguana with a pink collar) <br>
PICARD: It would seem the intron virus is not limited to humanoid
lifeforms. <br>
DATA: No, sir. <br>
PICARD: What is it? <br>
DATA: These kittens were born less than twenty four hours. It would
appear that Spot's transformation took place at approximately the same
time. <br>
PICARD: So Spot was giving birth to the kittens at the same time that
she was changing into a reptilian lifeform. <br>
DATA: I believe so. For some reason, the intron virus was not passed on
to the kittens. I do not know why. <br>
PICARD: If I remember my biology, there are several natural immune
systems that come into play in the mother's womb to protect the foetus
from viral infections. <br>
DATA: That is true. Placental barrier, maternal antibodies and amniotic
fluids all serve as a filtration system. <br>
PICARD: Maybe we could have inhibited the intron virus by using the
natural antibodies in Spot's amniotic fluid. <br>
DATA: It would take further research, but I believe to be effective on
humanoid crewmembers, humanoid antibodies would be necessary. <br>
PICARD: Then we should locate a pregnant humanoid. <br>
DATA: Nurse Ogawa has recently became pregnant. <br>
PICARD: Where is she? <br>
DATA: I have traced her comm. badge signal to deck seventeen, section
twenty one alpha. <br>
PICARD: The Arboretum. <br>
(ship shake) <br>
DATA: One of the warp plasma vents has failed. Main Engineering has
been abandoned. There is no one there to fix the problem.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: I can repair the damaged plasma vent from
here. <br>
PICARD: I'm going to check the status of the warp core. <br>
(it's dark, and cobwebs are everywhere. Picard looks through a window
at the warp core and something with half a face and a few compound eyes
throws itself at the glass) <br>
PICARD: Data! <br>
(it skitters away) <br>
PICARD: What was that? <br>
DATA: I believe it was Lieutenant Barclay. He appeared to be partially
transformed into an arachnid. <br>
PICARD: A spider? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. Are you all right, Captain? <br>
PICARD: I have these intense feelings of fear and panic. I feel as if I
were being watched. I can't explain it. <br>
DATA: You may be experiencing the initial stages of your
transformation. Early primates were often prey to larger carnivores. As
a result, their instincts probably included a heightened sense of
awareness. <br>
PICARD: In that case, my instincts tell me that we'd better hurry.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Alyssa the ape is on a biobed and Picard is biting
his nails) <br>
DATA: Captain, I have analysed Nurse Ogawa's embryo. It has been
unaffected by the virus. I believe I can use her amniotic fluid as a
template for a retrovirus. It would neutralise the synthetic T-cell,
and re-establish the original genetic patterns of each host. <br>
PICARD: How soon can you do that? <br>
DATA: It will not take long to isolate the appropriate genetic
material. I will need to get the Sickbay computer back on <br>
(something tries to batter down the door) <br>
PICARD: What was that? <br>
DATA: It is large. Approximately two hundred kilograms. It is heavily
armored with an exoskeleton. Life signs appear to be Klingon. <br>
PICARD: Worf. <br>
(the door starts to buckle) <br>
PICARD: Set your phaser to heavy stun. <br>
DATA: We cannot be certain a stun setting will have any effect on him.
A higher setting may kill him. <br>
(the wide shot shows Riker and Troi are also on biobeds) <br>
PICARD: Listen to that. He sounds very angry, really, really
aggressive. What do you think he wants? Do you think he's responding to
some predatory instinct? Do you think he see us as prey? <br>
DATA: There are crewmembers in the corridors and other sections of the
ship. It would be much easier for him to capture and consume one of
them, than to attempt to break through a door. <br>
PICARD: Then what does he want? Predators use vocalisations to frighten
other predators and to mark territory, and to commence mating process.
A mating process. Counsellor Troi was bitten by a Klingon but not in a
place that might be life-threatening. Nowhere near a major artery or
organ. Data, look at this. Look at this injury. This wound was never
intended to give her any kind of serious harm. <br>
DATA: Captain, what are you suggesting? <br>
PICARD: Is it possible that Worf could see Counsellor Troi as his mate?
<br>
DATA: If that is true, he must be trying to reach her now. <br>
PICARD: Well, we can't just leave. We have to stay here and protect
her. And we have to keep on working on the retrovirus. If we could
distract him, if we could lure him away from her. <br>
DATA: The mating instinct is quite strong in Klingon biology. I am not
certain what would be an effective lure. <br>
PICARD: Klingons have got a very powerful sense of smell. If we could
duplicate Deanna's pheromones and then convince him she's no longer in
Sickbay, that she'd gone into some other part of the ship. <br>
DATA: I am extracting a blood sample from one of her sebaceous glands,
where the pheromones are produced. I believe I can activate the
pheromones with a bioactivant solution. <br>
PICARD: Can you amplify the pheromones? They need to be much more
powerful than Deanna's actual scent. <br>
DATA: I believe this will produce the desired effect. I will use it to
draw Worf to a another part of the ship. <br>
PICARD: No, no, no. You must go on working on the retrovirus. I'll go. <br>
DATA: Captain, that is extremely unwise. Worf may be much faster than <br>
PICARD: No time. No time to argue.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BARCLAY: So, this is my fault? <br>
CRUSHER: No. In a way it's mine. I didn't realise it at the time, but
there's an anomaly in your genetic chemistry that caused the synthetic
T-cell to mutate. Instead of activating one dormant gene, it started
activating all of them, including your introns. <br>
BARCLAY: And that's what er, and that's what caused me to devolve? <br>
CRUSHER: You and every other member of the crew. The T-cell became
airborne and started to spread like a virus. You know, Reg, this is a
completely new disease, and it's traditional to classify a new disease
with the name of the first diagnosed patient. <br>
BARCLAY: Oh! You mean you want to name the disease after me? <br>
CRUSHER: That's right. How about Barclay's Protomorphosis Syndrome? <br>
BARCLAY: Barclay's Protomorphosis. It has a nice ring to it. Thank you,
Doctor. <br>
(Barclay leaves) <br>
CRUSHER: He transformed into a spider and now he has a disease named
after him. <br>
