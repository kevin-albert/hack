RIKER: Already? <br>
WORF: And we have begun power supply calibration. <br>
RIKER: You're just too damned efficient, Lieutenant. <br>
WORF: Thank you, sir. <br>
RIKER: Continue with the testing, Mister Worf. Here's the final
schedule for the shore leave and for the personnel transfers. By the
way, I'm looking forward to meeting your parents. <br>
WORF: Sir? <br>
RIKER: They're on the visitors' list. You didn't know? <br>
WORF: No, sir. It is inappropriate for a Klingon to receive family
while on duty. As humans, my parents do not understand. <br>
RIKER: Well, I'm not sure that I would either, Worf, since this isn't a
Klingon ship. If you don't want to see your parents, that's your
business, but we don't get to Earth all that often. I'm sure we can
arrange for you to have more off duty time while they're here. <br>
WORF: No, sir. That will not be necessary. <br>
RIKER: Dismissed. Mister Worf, if you're worried that they might learn
about what happened on the Klingon planet <br>
WORF: Not at all. I have already informed them by correspondence of my
discommendation. I do not believe any human can truly understand my
dishonour. <br>

TROI: Really? <br>
PICARD: Yes. It's the first time in almost twenty years. <br>
TROI: Interesting. <br>
PICARD: Counsellor. <br>
TROI: I just find it interesting. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, the man who
couldn't be pried out of his seat for a vacation for three years <br>
PICARD: It's Earth. It's home. Do I need another reason? <br>
TROI: I don't know. What do you think? <br>
PICARD: Your help has been invaluable during my recovery, but, look,
I'm better. The injuries are healing. <br>
TROI: Those you can see in the mirror. <br>
PICARD: The nightmares have ended. All I need now is a little time to
myself. <br>
TROI: I agree. In fact, I'm delighted you're going. It's just that the
choice of where you're going could stand some scrutiny. <br>
PICARD: If you wish to believe that my going home is a direct result of
being held captive by the Borg, be my guest. <br>
TROI: Is that what you believe? <br>
PICARD: I hate it when you do that. <br>
TROI: Captain, you do need time. You cannot achieve complete recovery
so quickly. And it's perfectly normal, after what you've been through,
to spend a great deal of time trying to find yourself again. <br>
PICARD: And what better place to find oneself than on the streets of
one's home village. <br>
TROI: Interesting. Have a good trip, Captain. <br>

WORF: I am not looking forward to this. I wish they would come so it
would begin and end sooner. <br>
O'BRIEN: I know what you mean, Lieutenant. <br>
WORF: Unlikely. <br>
O'BRIEN: Last time my old man was on board I found him chasing Nurse
Stanton around a biobed in Sickbay. <br>

O'BRIEN: Miles Edward O'Brien, sir. Good to meet you. <br>
SERGEY: Don't call me sir. I used to work for a living. <br>
HELENA: He's joking. The proudest day of his life was when Worf earned
his commission. <br>
SERGEY: Can you imagine an old enlisted man like me raising a boy to be
an officer? <br>
HELENA: Come on, Sergey. There's plenty of time to chat with the boys.
Your father has been so looking forward to this. <br>
SERGEY: Yes, I want to see everything. The whole ship. At home I have
all the specs and diagrams of the Galaxy-class starships. <br>
WORF: We are in the midst of a repair. I cannot give you a complete
tour. <br>
SERGEY: I'm sure if you asked the Captain <br>
HELENA: You agreed not to embarrass him. Besides, we have come to see
Worf, not the ship. <br>

PICARD: Oh, I'm fine. <br>
MARIE: Well, Robert and I are delighted that you've come to stay with
us. <br>
PICARD: I was, I was thinking I, I might be imposing. I could very
easily stay in the village. <br>
MARIE: I wouldn't hear of it. It's your home and it will always be your
home. Do things look that different? <br>
(Mock Tudor Nouveau, with first floor protruding over the ground floor,
tall brick chimney stacks) <br>
PICARD: No. In fact, it's amazing how little it has changed. Everything
is exactly as I remember it. The house, the hills, every tree, every
bush seems untouched by the passage of time. <br>
MARIE: Robert's worked hard to keep it that way. It's very important to
him. <br>
PICARD: As it was to our father. <br>
RENE: Someday I'm going to be a starship captain. <br>
PICARD: You look exactly like Robert when he was your age. I half
expect to see myself as a boy come running out that door to play. <br>

CRUSHER: I left it here in storage a long time ago after Jack died.
Odds and ends, mostly. <br>
TROI: (reading a book title) How to Advance Your Career through
Marriage? <br>
CRUSHER: It was a joke. Jack sent it to me while I was still in medical
school. It was his way of proposing to me. <br>
TROI: What's that? <br>
CRUSHER: It's for Wesley, from Jack. I'd forgotten it. Maybe I was just
trying to forget it. <br>
TROI: Why? <br>
CRUSHER: Jack recorded a holographic message to Wesley just after he
was born. It was a gift for when he grew up. Jack was going to make
many more of them. He never had the chance. <br>
TROI: Are you afraid of what it might say? <br>
CRUSHER: No, I just don't know if it'll do more harm than good.
Wesley's finally come to terms with his father's death. <br>
TROI: Wesley has a lot of questions about his father. Things that you
can't answer for him. Perhaps seeing this will help him understand. </font></p>

is our little seven year old sitting on a chair and glaring across the
room at five teenage boys, all of them with bloody noses. <br>

an only child. <br>

SERGEY: Okay. Okay. Enough stories. Well, how about giving us a look at
the new engine core. I used to be a warp field specialist on the old
Excelsior class. <br>
LAFORGE: I'd be delighted. Mrs. Rozhenko? <br>
HELENA: No, no, no, no, no. You two go ahead. Your father will be
hours. Worf, why don't you show me the arboretum? <br>
WORF: Commander La Forge, call me when you, when my father wishes to
leave. <br>
SERGEY: I can find my own way. Turbolift four is just over there,
right? I have all the specs and designs at home. <br>
(Worf and Helena leave) <br>
LAFORGE: The theta-matrix compositer makes the recrystallisation
process ten times more efficient than the old Excelsior class ships. <br>
SERGEY: Amazing. Commander, if you have a couple of minutes, there is
something else I want to ask you. <br>
LAFORGE: Sure, Chief. <br>

PICARD: Is he still trying to raise the ocean floor? <br>
MARIE: Oh yes, he's very excited about it. He's been made a supervisor
now, as his wife is constantly reminding anyone who'll listen. <br>
ROBERT: I see no good reason why the Earth should have another
subcontinent. <br>
PICARD: It's really quite exciting, actually, if you understand the
potential of exploring a new world on our own planet. <br>

ROBERT: Forty seven. You've been drinking too much of that artificial
stuff. What do you call it? Synthehol? It's spoiled you. Ruined your
palate. <br>
PICARD: On the contrary. I think that synthehol heightens one's
appreciation for the genuine article. <br>
ROBERT: Delicious, Marie. <br>
MARIE: Thank you. <br>
PICARD: Leave it to Robert to find the best cook in France, then marry
her. <br>
ROBERT: Yes, but sadly cooking is becoming a lost art. That's your
wretched technology again. <br>
MARIE: Robert and I have had more than a few discussions about getting
a replicator in the house. <br>
PICARD: I remember the same discussions between mother and father. <br>
ROBERT: Father understood better than anybody else the danger of losing
those values which we hold most precious. <br>
PICARD: I don't see that you have to lose anything just by adding a
convenience. <br>
ROBERT: You wouldn't, but in my view, life is already too convenient. <br>
MARIE: This is a very old argument. <br>
RENE: I wrote a report on starships for school. <br>
MARIE: And he won a ribbon for it. <br>
RENE: The teacher said it was one of the best he'd ever heard. <br>
PICARD: Good for you, Uncle. You know what? I once wrote a report about
starships when I was about your age. <br>
RENE: Did you win a ribbon too? <br>
PICARD: I don't recall. <br>

course you won the ribbon. You always did. <br>

out there without you encouraging him. <br>

Jean-Luc. <br>
PICARD: No, not true. I was interested. And I was proud that my family
were helping to preserve the traditions. I just didn't feel bound by
those traditions. <br>
LOUIS: You always reached for the future and your brother for the past.
<br>
PICARD: There should be room for both in this life. And what about you,
you old rascal. You've taken quite a shift into the future yourself. <br>
LOUIS: Well, hydroponics turned out to be so dull. <br>
PICARD: You should have listened to me at the beginning. <br>

project. <br>

you believe I run the entire project. <br>
PICARD: Well. it's certainly very exciting work. I've kept up on it in
the journals. <br>
LOUIS: Really? <br>
PICARD: It's only. There's just one thing I don't understand. You were
such a rotten swimmer, Louis. Thinking of you working on the ocean
floor. <br>
LOUIS: I suppose we all find ways to confront our greatest fears. <br>
PICARD: Seriously, how do you plan to accelerate the buildup on the
underside of the mantle without increasing the stress on the tectonic
plates? <br>
LOUIS: You really have kept up, haven't you? The truth is we don't
know, yet. <br>
PICARD: On the Enterprise, we used harmonic resonators to relieve the
tectonic pressures on Drema Four. Obviously, it's not the same problem
but <br>
LOUIS: You know, it's such a shame. The government is looking for
someone to take over the project. A real leader who'll go in there and
get things moving. And they are looking for you, Jean-Luc. I know, I
know, you'd never leave Starfleet. <br>
PICARD: No, I'd never leave Starfleet. <br>
LOUIS: That's what I thought, but if nothing else, why don't I send
over some of the internal studies of the tectonic problem, since you're
interested? We could use any thoughts you might have. <br>

GUINAN: Well, part of him may feel that way, but there's another part
that I've seen. A part that comes in and drinks prune juice. A part

sure I wanted you to come. I am glad you are here. <br>
HELENA: We had to come. <br>
SERGEY: Our boy was in trouble. After we read your letter about the
discommendation from the Klingons. <br>
HELENA: We don't exactly understand it all. <br>
SERGEY: We don't have to. We know what kind of man you are. <br>
HELENA: Whatever you did, we know it was for a good reason. <br>
WORF: I must bear my dishonour alone. <br>
SERGEY: That is not true. <br>
HELENA: I'm sorry if this is too human of us but, whenever you are
suffering, you must remember we are with you. <br>
SERGEY: And that we're proud of you, and that we love you. <br>
HELENA: You're our son.

ROBERT: Careful. You're not used to drinking the real thing. This
synthehol never leaves you out of control, is that so? <br>
PICARD: That's so. <br>
ROBERT: This will. (pours himself the last dregs) Now there is
something I'd like to see. <br>
PICARD: What's that? <br>
ROBERT: The gallant Captain out of control. Mind if I ask you a
question? What the devil happened to you up there? <br>
PICARD: Is this brotherly concern? <br>
ROBERT: No. Curiosity. What did they do to you? <br>
PICARD: You know what happened. <br>
ROBERT: Not precisely. I gather you were hurt. Humiliated. I always
thought you needed a little humiliation. Or was it humility? Either
would do. (Jean-Luc storms out of the house) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBERT: Why do you walk away? That isn't your
style. <br>
PICARD: I'm tired of fighting with you, Robert. <br>
ROBERT: Tired? <br>
PICARD: That's right. <br>
ROBERT: Yes. Tired of the Enterprise too? The great Captain Picard of
Starfleet falls to Earth, ready to plunge into the water with Louis.
That isn't the brother that I remember. Still, I suppose it must have
seemed like the ideal situation, hmm? Local boy makes good. Returns
home after twenty years to a hero's welcome. <br>
PICARD: I'm not a hero. <br>
ROBERT: Of course you are. Admit it. You'd never settle for less than
that and you never will. <br>
PICARD: That's not true. <br>
ROBERT: Cancel the parade? In your favour? <br>
PICARD: No! I never sought that rubbish. <br>
ROBERT: Never sought? Never sought president of the school,
valedictorian, athletic hero with your arms raised in victory? <br>
PICARD: Valedictorian? Arms raised in victory? Were you so jealous? <br>
ROBERT: Yes, damn it. I was always so jealous, I had a right to be. <br>
PICARD: Right? <br>
ROBERT: I was always your brother, watching you receive the cheers,
watching you break every rule our father made and get away with it. <br>
PICARD: Why didn't you break a few rules? <br>
ROBERT: Because I was the elder brother, the responsible one. It was my
job to look after you. <br>
PICARD: Look after me? You? You were a bully. <br>
ROBERT: Sometimes. Maybe. Sometimes I even enjoyed bullying you. <br>
PICARD: All right. Try it now. <br>
ROBERT: Did you come back, Jean-Luc? Did you come back because you
wanted me to look after you again? <br>
PICARD: Damn you! <br>
(And he punches his brother, sending him flying over some barrels into
the vineyard proper. There they fight in the muddy irrigation ditches,
through the vines until they finally fall back laughing)&nbsp;<br>
PICARD: You were asking for it, you know. <br>
ROBERT: Yes, but you needed it. You have been terribly hard on
yourself. <br>
PICARD: You don't know, Robert. You don't know. They took everything I
was. They used me to kill and to destroy, and I couldn't stop them. I
should have been able to stop them! I tried. I tried so hard, but I
wasn't strong enough. I wasn't good enough. I should have been able to
stop them. I should! I should! <br>
ROBERT: So, my brother is a human being after all. This is going to be
with you a long time, Jean-Luc. A long time. You have to learn to live
with it. You have a simple choice now. Live with it below the sea with
Louis, or above the clouds with the Enterprise. <br>
PICARD: You know, I think you were right after all. I think I did come
back so that you could help me. <br>
ROBERT: You know what? I still don't like you, Jean-Luc.

this? <br>
PICARD: He'd probably send us both to bed without our supper. <br>
MARIE: Well, perhaps it's just as well you got it out of your systems. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps it was, Marie. Perhaps it was. I'll contact Louis and
cancel the meeting with the Board of Governors. It's time that I was
going. <br>

JACK: Hello, Wesley. As I make this recording, you are about ten weeks
old. I wanted you to know who I am today. You see, this Jack Crusher
won't exist by the time you're grown up. I'll be older, more
experienced, and hopefully a little wiser. But this person will be gone
and I want you to know who your father was when you came into the
world. When I see you lying there in your crib, I realise I don't know
the first thing about being a father. So let me just apologise for all
the mistakes I'm about to make as you grow up. I hope you don't grow up
resenting the fact that I was gone so much. That comes with this
uniform. I don't know if I can explain why Starfleet means so much to
me. Maybe you'll understand when you get this recording. Maybe you'll
even want to try one of these on. But you'll probably be a doctor like
your mother. You're only a baby, but it's remarkable. I can see in your
face all the people I've loved in my lifetime. Your mother, my father
and mother. Our family. I can see me in you, too. And I can feel that
you're my son. I don't know how to describe it, but there's this
connection, this bond. I'll always be a part of you, Wesley. Well, I
hope this made some sense to you. I'm not sure that it does to me, but
maybe I'll do better next time. I love you, Wesley. <br>
WESLEY: Goodbye, Dad.
