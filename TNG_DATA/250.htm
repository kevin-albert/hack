RIKER: Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Any requests tonight? <br>
TROI: Night Bird. <br>
(Troi is given a Look) <br>
RIKER: Any request? <br>
TROI: Night Bird! <br>
RIKER: Ladies and gentlemen, Night Bird. One, two. <br>
CRUSHER: What was that all about? <br>
TROI: Will's been trying to get this piece right for ten years now.
He's never made it through the solo. <br>
(he certainly looks worried) <br>
TROI: Here it comes. <br>

RIKER: Go ahead. <br>
DATA [OC]: Commander, you are needed on the Bridge. <br>

RIKER: You wanted to see me, Mister Data? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. It appears we will be able to transport to the surface
sooner than anticipated. <br>
RIKER: Is the planet's distortion field re-phasing sooner than we
predicted? <br>
DATA: No, sir. Using the Potemkin's transport logs from the original
evacuation, Commander La Forge and I were able to modify the
transporters. <br>
RIKER: So we can beam through a higher distortion field. <br>
DATA: The transporters are considerably more efficient than those used
on the Potemkin eight years ago. <br>
RIKER: That's a good thing. I almost didn't make it off the surface.
When can we get started? <br>
DATA: Ninety seven minutes, sir. <br>
RIKER: How long will the transport window be open? <br>
DATA: Twenty six minutes. After that, the distortion field will
re-phase. <br>
RIKER: That doesn't give us much time to retrieve the database. <br>
DATA: The planet's proximity to its sun will create two additional
transport windows in the next three days. <br>
RIKER: Let's hope that's enough. <br>
DATA: It will have to be, sir. The next transport window will not occur
for another eight years, when the planet's orbit will bring it close
enough to the sun to de-phase the distortion field. <br>
RIKER: Okay, notify the away team that we're going in ahead of
schedule. I'll tell the Captain. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir.

RIKER: This is different than I remember. The place was a mess when we
left. <br>
DATA: Commander. <br>
RIKER: Someone was here. <br>
WORF: A ship could have been caught in the distortion field and
crashed. The survivors may have taken refuge here. <br>
DATA: Commander, someone is approaching. A humanoid. Forty metres due
east and closing. <br>
(they take up defensive positions and a figure in tattered clothing
comes through the door. He looks like Riker's identical twin!) <br>
RIKER: Who are you? <br>
RIKER 2: Who are you? <br>
RIKER: I'm Commander William Riker from the Federation Starship
Enterprise. <br>
RIKER 2: That's not possible. I'm Will Riker. <br>
DATA: May I ask how you got here? <br>
RIKER 2: Eight years ago, I led a team to evacuate this station. <br>
RIKER: What ship were you on? <br>
RIKER 2: The Potemkin. <br>
DATA: Why did you not return to the Potemkin with the others? <br>
RIKER 2: I was the last one out. The distortion field must have
interfered with the transport. They lost their signal lock on me. When
I tried to contact the ship, I couldn't get through the interference.
If you check with Starfleet I'm sure they will have recorded that I was
lost on that day. <br>
RIKER: That's not what happened. I was the last one out and I made it
back to the Potemkin. <br>
RIKER 2: You don't believe me? <br>
RIKER: It's not that we don't believe you. It's just hard to see how
both stories could be true. Would you be willing have our Doctor check
you out? <br>
RIKER 2: Of course. <br>
RIKER: Mister Worf, take him directly to Sickbay, and notify the
Captain once you're on board. Let's get to work. <br>
WORF: Worf to Enterprise. Two to beam up. <br>

years ago. <br>
RIKER 2: I was doing some repairs under the station when an earthquake
hit. I got caught in a rockslide. I had to set it myself. <br>
PICARD: Jean-Luc Picard. <br>
RIKER 2: Lieutenant Will Riker. <br>
PICARD: I hope you understand our need to verify your claim. <br>
RIKER 2: Yes, sir. <br>
CRUSHER: Genetically, he's indistinguishable from Commander Riker. <br>
PICARD: Could there be some sort of cloning involved here? <br>
CRUSHER: I don't think so. There's no genetic drift. <br>
PICARD: But it's not conclusive. <br>
CRUSHER: That's why I compared their brain scans. Brain organisation
patterns are as unique as fingerprints. Except for minor, minor
differences, theirs are identical. <br>
PICARD: But can't brain patterns be cloned? <br>
CRUSHER: No. They're determined by experience, mostly from early
childhood. <br>
PICARD: How can two grown men share the same childhood experiences? It
just doesn't make any sense. <br>
RIKER 2: I am Will Riker. I don't know who or what made it back to the
Potemkin that day, but it wasn't me. <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant, our Chief Engineer is checking the transport logs
of the Potemkin. Perhaps that will shed some light on the matter. Don't
worry, we will get to the bottom of this. And in the meantime, you will
be taken to your quarters. Try and make yourself as comfortable as
possible. <br>
RIKER 2: I will. The replicators on the station haven't worked for a
long time ago. It's been a while since I've had a decent meal. Doctor. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: Apparently there was a massive energy
surge in the distortion field around the planet just at the moment you
tried to beam out. The Transporter Chief tried to compensate by
initiating a second containment beam. <br>
DATA: An interesting approach. He must have been planning to
reintegrate the two patterns in the transport buffer. <br>
LAFORGE: Actually, it wasn't really necessary. Commander Riker's
pattern maintained its integrity with just the one containment beam. He
made it back to the ship just fine. <br>
CRUSHER: What happened to the second beam? <br>
LAFORGE: The Transporter Chief shut it down, but somehow it was
reflected back to the surface. <br>
PICARD: And another William Riker materialised there. <br>
RIKER: How was the second pattern able to maintained its integrity? <br>
LAFORGE: The containment beam must have had the exact same phase
differential as the distortion field. <br>
RIKER: Which one of them is real? <br>
LAFORGE: That's the thing. Both. You were both materialised from a
complete pattern. <br>
CRUSHER: Up until that moment, you were the same person. <br>
PICARD: But of course, as you and Lieutenant Riker have lived very
different lives for the past eight years, you are now very different
people. I suppose it's a little like meeting someone's twin. But no
matter how strange it may seem to us, we now have two Will Rikers on
board. And as Lieutenant Riker will be with us for several days, I
think we should do everything we can to make him comfortable and
welcome. <br>
RIKER: We still have the problem of retrieving the database. The
computer on the station is not completely operational. <br>
DATA: Many of its components have been removed. Apparently Lieutenant
Riker used them to keep the station's radiation shield operational. <br>
PICARD: Can it be repaired, at least enough to access the database? <br>
RIKER: Without knowing what he did, that'll be tough. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps he can help us. <br>
PICARD: He was alone down there for a long time. I'm hesitant to let
him go back until he's been evaluated. <br>
TROI: I'll talk to him. <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Counsellor.

TROI: We need to talk. <br>
RIKER 2: You're on board because of him. <br>
TROI: No. Commander Riker and I are friends. Close friends, but nothing
more. Why don't we sit down? Do you remember the last time we saw each
other? <br>
RIKER 2: Like yesterday. The Janaran Falls on Betazed. <br>
TROI: It was the day before you started your tour on the Potemkin. <br>
RIKER 2: And we were going to meet on Risa, six weeks later. <br>
TROI: We never did. <br>
RIKER 2: I know. <br>
TROI: No, what I mean is, Commander Riker and I never did. You see, he
earned a promotion very quickly. <br>
RIKER 2: I know that too. 'For exceptional valour during the evacuation
of the research station on Nervala Four'. I looked at his service
record. <br>
TROI: He chose to make his career a priority. There wasn't much time
for anything else. We kept in touch but we didn't see each other again
until we were both posted to the Enterprise two years later. By then
our feelings for each other had changed. We've served together for six
years. Things never went back to the way they used to be. <br>
RIKER 2: I had a lot of time on my hands when I was down on that
station. There were days I felt so alone I thought I might lose my
mind. Do you know how I made it through? I thought if I hung on for
more day, they'd rescue me. Maybe I'd see you again. I guess things
don't always work out the way you expect them to. <br>
TROI: I know this isn't what you were hoping for, but that doesn't mean
you can't make a future for yourself. <br>
RIKER 2: Thanks. <br>
TROI: Captain Picard wanted me to find out if you'd be willing to help
us retrieve the station's database. <br>
RIKER 2: I reconfigured that computer so many times they probably can't
make heads or tails of it. I'd be happy to help. <br>
TROI: Do you feel up to it? <br>
RIKER 2: Absolutely. <br>
TROI: Good. I'll tell the Captain. Well, I have to go. <br>
RIKER 2: Deanna. I know it's been a long time since we've been
together, and I know your feelings have changed. Mine haven't. I can't
just give up. I'd like to be with you again. <br>

RIKER 2: I shunted the database to the main core underneath the

functioning now. <br>

whenever I wanted. It's been hard taking orders again. <br>
TROI: I can imagine. <br>
RIKER 2: But I guess I'll have to get used to it if I want to get my
career going again. <br>
TROI: Is that what you've decided to do? <br>

was thirty five. I'm a little behind schedule, I'll admit that. <br>

but there's nothing going to stand in the way of my getting what I
want. <br>
WAITER: There you go. <br>
RIKER 2: Thanks. You don't know how many times I thought about you,
about us. For weeks after the evacuation, I kept thinking they'd find a
way through the distortion field and come back for me. I even thought
we'd meet on Risa like we planned. But days went by and nobody came.
Then I realised why. They thought that I had been killed in the beam
out. No one came down because they thought there was no one to come
down for. So I figured that they'd had a memorial service for me.
Somehow that made me feel better. <br>
TROI: I can understand that. <br>
RIKER 2: You were there, all dressed in black. Very flattering on you,
by the way. <br>
TROI: I'm sure I looked terrible with my eyes all red and swollen from
crying. <br>
RIKER 2: Sometimes I would look up into the sky and I'd think, if I
tried hard enough, I could make you feel my presence. That if I could
let you know that I was alive, maybe you'd wait for me. I know it
sounds crazy, but there were times when I could've sworn. What am I
talking about? <br>
TROI: The other day, when I told you about how Commander Riker and I
didn't meet on Risa, what I didn't say was how disappointed I was. <br>
RIKER 2: You didn't have to. I knew. <br>
TROI: I started to hear from him less and less. I knew his career was
taking him away from me but I didn't want to believe it was over. I
spent a lot of time thinking about him. Wondering where he was, what he
was doing. Sometimes I'd look into the sky and imagine that he knew,
and that somehow he could sense me thinking about him. So, who knows?
Maybe one night we were looking up at the same star, and you were
thinking about me, and in a way, I was thinking about you.

PICARD: Lieutenant Riker has been to see me to talk about the away

directly accessing the main core underneath the station. <br>

opinion, it's too risky. <br>

different. I didn't know how you'd feel about it. <br>
RIKER: Flattered, sort of. <br>
TROI: This must be very strange for you. <br>
RIKER: Ever since he came on board, I find myself thinking about the
choice you and I made. <br>
TROI: Me too. <br>
RIKER: Do me a favour. Be careful. <br>
TROI: Will, I know you and he have had some problems. <br>
RIKER: That's not what I'm talking about. If he had gotten off the
planet instead of me, don't you think he would have made the same
choices that I made? I just don't want you to be hurt again.

RIKER: Here's your fifty. And ten more. <br>
RIKER 2: You didn't take any cards. You must be holding something. Why
not make it a little sweeter? <br>
RIKER: No, thanks. <br>
RIKER 2: Playing it safe? <br>
RIKER: You in? <br>

RIKER 2: Here's your ten, and it will cost you another one hundred. <br>
RIKER: I've practised in the mirror too long to be fooled by that face.
You're bluffing. Here's your hundred and twenty more. <br>
DATA: Dealer folds. <br>
RIKER 2: I thought if one thing were clear by now, it's that you and I
play things a little differently. <br>
RIKER: Why don't we wait and see who comes out on top. <br>
RIKER 2: I thought you were willing to settle for second. Commander. <br>
RIKER: I've never settled for anything in my life. I know what I want,
I know what I've got, and you'd be lucky to do as well. Lieutenant. <br>
RIKER 2: Here's your twenty. Three hundred more. <br>
RIKER: Now I know you're bluffing. <br>
RIKER 2: Are you in or not? <br>
RIKER: Why don't we get this over with? I'll call your three, and I'll
raise you anything you've got left. Well? <br>
RIKER 2: Take it. You always had the better hand, in everything.

RIKER 2: Hi. I'm sorry to just stop by like this but there's something
I'd like to talk to you about. <br>
(he enters) <br>
RIKER 2: Captain Picard made has some inquiries. He managed to get me a
posting on the Gandhi. And considering how long I've been out of
commission, it's an amazing opportunity. <br>
TROI: When would you leave? <br>
RIKER 2: In about a week. <br>
TROI: I see. <br>
RIKER 2: Deanna. After I've served for six months, I'm eligible to
bring family aboard. If we got married <br>
TROI: You said those exact words to me before you went to serve on the
Potemkin. <br>
RIKER 2: I know. I was just held up for a while. <br>
TROI: But if you hadn't been, what would have happened between us? <br>
RIKER 2: I wouldn't've made the mistake of leaving you. I know that
much. <br>
TROI: I don't know if I can believe that. It took me a long time to get
over what happened between Commander Riker and me. I don't know that I
want to put myself in that position again. <br>
RIKER 2: I would never hurt you, Deanna. <br>
TROI: It's not just that. I've worked hard to make a life for myself on
the Enterprise. I'm happy here. <br>
RIKER 2: If the situation were different, I'd stay. But I can't. Not
while he's aboard. <br>
TROI: I know. <br>
RIKER 2: Are you saying it's over? <br>
TROI: No. No. I just don't know if I'm ready to give up my life here.
Maybe we both need some time. <br>
(a kiss) <br>
RIKER 2: Goodnight.

RIKER: You're with me, Lieutenant. <br>
RIKER 2: I thought Commander Data's expertise. <br>
RIKER: It doesn't take that much expertise to repair a servo link. You
and I can handle it. <br>
(the two Rikers leave) <br>
DATA: Lieutenant, I am curious about something. If you met a double of
yourself, would you have difficulty interacting with him? <br>
WORF: I think so. <br>
DATA: Why? <br>
WORF: I am not easy to get along with. <br>
DATA: But Commander Riker and Lieutenant Riker are. Yet they seem to
have trouble getting along with each another. I have found that humans
value their uniqueness, that sense that they are different from every
one else. The existence of a double would preclude that feeling. Could
that be the source of the friction? <br>
WORF: Or perhaps it is more a matter of seeing something in your
double. Something you do not like in yourself.

RIKER 2: Your orders, sir. How would you like me to get over there,
sir? <br>
RIKER: You've been down here dozens of times. I'm sure you know the
best way. <br>
RIKER 2: Yes, sir. I do. <br>
(they head through the scaffolding, then Riker 2's tricorder beeps) <br>
RIKER 2: It's leaking ion radiation. <br>
RIKER: Why didn't you report this? <br>
RIKER 2: It wasn't here before. This must have just happened recently.
If we have to repair this conduit, we won't have time to access that
computer core. <br>
(Riker 1 goes to a wall panel and pulls a switch. Something switches
off) <br>
RIKER: Scan it now. <br>
RIKER 2: It's working. The radiation levels are dropping to normal. <br>
RIKER: Next time, don't give up so easily. <br>
(they head off across a metal bridge to the core. It gives way and
Riker 2 is hanging over a very deep drop. Riker 1 lies down and grabs
his arms.) <br>

(but Riker 2 can't get a foothold) I'm being pulled in. <br>
