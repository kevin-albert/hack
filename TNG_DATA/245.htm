PICARD: No need to report. I'm just here to do some work on my own. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: I'd like to talk to Doctor Mowray at his archaeological site on
Landris Two. Could you put it through to my Ready room? <br>
DATA: I'm sorry, sir, but Stellar Cartography has requested a
communications blackout while they run an experiment. <br>
PICARD: How long will it be? <br>

necessary. <br>

NELLA: In or out, just close that door. And don't move. It'll take a
second for our eyes to re-adjust. Okay, levate to three point two,
Marquez. <br>
MARQUEZ: Now at three point two, Commander. <br>
NELLA: Good. Good we can do this. No, no, no, we're losing vertical
alignment. Compensate. Compensate! <br>
MARQUEZ: Compensating. <br>
NELLA: Gently. Gently, Marquez, don't bump it. No. No wait. Hit the.
Oh, forget it. Forget it. Lights. Whoever you are, you just ruined four
hours of work. <br>
PICARD: You might have taken the simple precaution of locking the door.
<br>
NELLA: It's three o'clock in the morning. Captain Picard. <br>
PICARD: I assume that you must be Lieutenant Commander Daren. <br>
NELLA: Yes, sir. I'm sorry. It's just we weren't expecting anybody to
be up at this hour. <br>
PICARD: Well, you're new on the Enterprise. You'll have to learn to
expect the unexpected. <br>
NELLA: That's why I put in for this assignment, sir. <br>
PICARD: Excellent. Now perhaps you can tell me what was so important
that it required depriving the Captain of his cup of Earl Grey? <br>
NELLA: Earl Grey? No wonder you can't sleep. Computer, bring
replicators back online and give me a cup of Daren herbal tea blend
number three, hot. You shouldn't be drinking a stimulant at this time
of night. I think you'll like this. <br>
(Picard tries it and pulls a face, but anyone who can drink hot
Bergamot shouldn't
criticise other blends) <br>
NELLA: I've programmed seven other blends into the replicator. You're
bound to like one of them. <br>
PICARD: I look forward to sampling them. <br>
NELLA: I'm sorry if the system blackouts we requested inconvenienced
you. We're taking very precise gravimetric readings. It wouldn't have
taken much to throw them off. <br>
PICARD: What were the readings for? <br>
NELLA: I'm trying to construct a mathematical model of an emerging star
system. If it works, we'll be able to predict the configuration of a
star system that won't be formed for another two million years. <br>
PICARD: A long time to wait to see if you're right. <br>
NELLA: I have a few things to do between now and then.

Nebula in three hours. <br>
PICARD: Yes. I understand it has unusual radioactive emissions, and I'm
sure that Stellar Sciences will find it a most interesting study. <br>
RIKER: Commander Daren has already requested extra time on the main
sensor array. <br>
PICARD: Well, you have the Bridge, Number One. <br>
DATA: Captain, I would like to remind you of our concert this evening
in Ten Forward. We will perform Chopin's Trio in G Minor. <br>

PICARD: And so the upshot is that we'll be close enough for you to slip
away for a few days and see Wesley. <br>
CRUSHER: Oh, that's wonderful. Thank you, Jean-Luc. This is delicious. What is it? <br>
PICARD: It's an herbal tea blend. I, er, found it in the replicator
files. Have you met any of the new crewmembers who came aboard at
Starbase two eighteen? <br>
CRUSHER: In fact, I have a new nurse, Beck. He's an obstetrics
specialist. <br>
PICARD: I met the new head of Stellar Sciences last night. Lieutenant
Commander Daren. <br>
CRUSHER: Yes. Nella Daren. She came into Sickbay for her physical last
week. I like her. Very forthright. <br>
PICARD: Did you know it is now possible to predict the configuration of
a star system which won't be formed for another two million years? <br>
CRUSHER: Really? No, I didn't. <br>
PICARD: It's really quite intriguing. The whole thing is made possible
by a complex mathematical construct based on fractal particle motion.
But that's only the foundation. The modeling itself is done by
gravimetric wave input. <br>
CRUSHER: I see. <br>
PICARD: Well, I know this is all pretty dry stuff. Stellar cartography
isn't everybody's cup of tea. <br>
CRUSHER: I'm sure it's really quite fascinating. <br>
PICARD: You know, we'd should be getting along to Ten Forward. We're
going to be late for the concert.

NELLA: Well done, Mister Data. Well done. <br>
PICARD: Commander, that was a remarkable performance. <br>
CRUSHER: You are very talented. <br>
NELLA: Thank you. <br>
DATA: I noticed that the applause this evening exceeded average decibel
levels. <br>
NELLA: I guess that means they enjoyed themselves. <br>
PICARD: I think that much was obvious. <br>
DATA: Excuse me. I have not yet congratulated Ensign Cheney. <br>
CRUSHER: I'll go with you. <br>
PICARD: Commander, you must have been playing since you were young. I
played the piano for a while when I was small, but I didn't put in the
practice you must have. <br>
NELLA: Practising was never my problem. In fact, my parents had to make
me go out and play. <br>
PICARD: I wanted to ask, during the second arpeggio in the first
movement, I noticed that you played an F minor chord instead of a
diminished D. <br>
NELLA: You're a musician. What's your instrument? We should play some
time. <br>
PICARD: No, no, no, I'm just an amateur. But your choice in that
arpeggio was delightful. Not at all what one would expect. <br>
NELLA: Well, Captain, now that I'm on your ship, maybe you should start
expecting the unexpected.

could have another few hours on the main sensor array? <br>
RIKER: I'm sorry, the array has already been allocated to Engineering.
They're running some warp field tests. <br>
NELLA: If we go offline now, we'll lose the gas flow pattern we've been
tracking. <br>
RIKER: I understand, but there are other departments waiting to use the

NELLA: That doesn't matter as long as you enjoy it. <br>
PICARD: Yes, but I wouldn't want to inflict it on someone else. <br>

PICARD: Yes, of course. Yes, you're not holding it quite right. May I? <br>
NELLA: Please. <br>

NELLA: You're better than you think. Really. We should play together. <br>
PICARD: There isn't a piano. <br>

NELLA: I picked it up on Mataline Two. It's amazing. <br>

NELLA: What were you working on before I came in? <br>
PICARD: Bach, the third Brandenburg. <br>
NELLA: Perfect. Go ahead. <br>

PICARD: I'm sorry. <br>
NELLA: It's all right. You're not used to playing with anyone, are you?
<br>
PICARD: Just the computer. <br>
NELLA: I may not be as precise as a computer, but I think you'll enjoy
it more. Why don't we start with something a little simpler. How about?

NELLA: Good. Very good. Now let's have a little fun with it. <br>

it is. <br>
PICARD: But I have to be concerned about more than my own happiness. <br>
TROI: And you think that your feelings toward Nella could change the
way you function as Captain. <br>
PICARD: Yes. Relationships with co-workers can be fraught with
consequences. <br>
TROI: That's true. But cutting yourself off from your feelings can
carry consequences that are just as serious. <br>

consciousness, and in the space of twenty five minutes I lived a
lifetime on that planet. I had a wife, and children, and a grandchild.
And it was absolutely real to me. When I awoke, all that I had left of
that life there was the flute that I had taught myself to play. <br>

from the Bersallin sun. They cause a cascade effect in the planet's
atmosphere that. Oh, I'm boring you. <br>
PICARD: No, no, no you're not. It's just that Commander Riker came to
talk to me this afternoon. About you. <br>
NELLA: About the personnel transfer? I thought he looked uncomfortable.
He thought I was asking for special treatment. (Picard nods) I was just
doing what I thought was best for my department. <br>
PICARD: That's what I told him. But we have to be careful. Obviously
it's easy for people to misunderstand. <br>
NELLA: I don't like the thought of having to second-guess people all
the time. If I have to worry about what people are thinking about me,
I'll be concentrating on the wrong thing, and I won't be as effective
an officer. <br>
PICARD: All I'm saying is that it's something we have to be aware of.
But you mustn't compromise yourself. You must do what you have to do.
Because if I find that my head of Stellar Sciences isn't being
effective, then I shall do what I must to do and I shall replace her. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: A fire storm can kick up winds of over two
hundred kilometres per hour and temperatures as high as three hundred
degrees C. <br>
CRUSHER: Incredible. What causes them? <br>
NELLA: They form when solar flare radiation reacts with high energy
plasma present in the planet's atmosphere. <br>
CRUSHER: Wasn't the outpost built to withstand the conditions? <br>
LAFORGE: It was, both reinforced and insulated. But this is no ordinary
storm. It's twice as strong as anything they've ever seen. The outpost
just won't withstand it. <br>
RIKER: We'll arrive about an hour before the storm gets there. It will
take at least two hours to evacuate all the colonists off the surface. <br>
NELLA: I led a team of geologists to study the plasma geyser on Melnos
Four. We cross-connected a few thermal deflector units to create a
protective shield against the heat. <br>
LAFORGE: A firewall. <br>
NELLA: Would something like that work here? <br>
LAFORGE: You know, it might. (goes to the wall monitor) The storm is
approaching the outpost from this direction. If we were to set up a
series of thermal
deflector units along the northern perimeter, we could create a fire
wall and deflect some of the heat. The insulation from the outpost
should be able to handle the rest. <br>
DATA: Thermal deflectors generate a field approximately four hundred
metres wide. We would need to cross-connect six units and align them so
the fields overlap. <br>
RIKER: How many people would it take to set that up? <br>
LAFORGE: Twelve. Two per team. Cross-connecting that many units will be
a little tricky. Once they're set up, we'll have to leave the units in
place and transport our people out. Nobody would be able survive very
long outside that structure. <br>
PICARD: Let's do it. <br>
RIKER: The storm is going to interfere with communications. Everything
will need to be coordinated from the surface. Mister Data, you will
coordinate the evacuation of the colonists. Doctor, they have nine
patients in the outpost infirmary. Your first priority will be to get
them to Sickbay. After that you will stay on board the Enterprise, be
ready to receive casualties. Marquez, you will take some people down
and track the storm. All the other teams will need to be kept apprised
of its heading. Commander, you're in charge of deploying the
deflectors. Let's go. <br>
PICARD: Commander Daren. About these thermal deflectors. <br>
(everyone else leaves) <br>
PICARD: There must be one of any number of people could coordinate
their deployment. <br>
NELLA: I assume Commander Riker chose me because I'm the best person
for the job. Didn't we agree not to let our relationship get in the way
of our work? I'll be all right.

me. But never someone I've been in love with. And when I believed that
you were dead, I just began to shut down. I didn't want to think or

shore leave together. And, for the future, who knows? <br>
