<br>
SHREK: Not all the Klingons at Khitomer were killed during the
massacre. Many were captured by the Romulans and placed in a prison
camp on a remote planet. Your father was among them. <br>
WORF: If my father were alive, it would his sons and their sons for
three generations. Even Alexander would bear the burden of guilt. <br>
TROI: So, you're willing to ignore the possibility because you're
concerned about dishonour? <br>
WORF: My father is dead. That Yridian is selling lies. <br>
SHREK: This is a homing device. It will allow you to find my ship when
I return. <br>
BA'EL: You are Klingon. Where did you come from? <br>
WORF: That does not matter. I have come to take you home. <br>
GI'RAL: He must leave at once. <br>
L'KOR: No, it's too late for that now. He would bring others. We are
not leaving here and neither are you. <br>

And now, the conclusion.</i>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">L'KOR: Take his pack. <br>
WORF: Are you afraid to die while escaping? <br>
L'KOR: We are dead, Worf. We died at Khitomer. <br>
GI'RAL: We were captured. It was worse than death. <br>
WORF: Why did you allow it to happen? <br>
GI'RAL: We had no choice. We were defending an outpost on the
perimeter. The Romulans took out our shields. The next blast rendered
us unconscious. When we awoke, we were prisoners, unarmed and shackled.
<br>
L'KOR: We were interrogated for three months. We tried to starve
ourselves but they kept us alive. <br>
GI'RAL: The Romulan Commander Tokath thought he was being kind. <br>
L'KOR: The Romulans hoped to trade our lives for territorial
concessions, but the Klingon High Council refused to negotiate. They
would not acknowledge that their warriors had been taken prisoner. <br>
GI'RAL: And when it was clear that we would be of no use to them,
Tokath offered to let us go. <br>
L'KOR: But we knew that our families believed we had fallen in battle,
so we did not wish to return to dishonour them. <br>
GI'RAL: We asked Tokath to let us stay and he took pity on us. <br>
WORF: I understand your desire to preserve your family's honour. But
what of your own? There is no honour in remaining prisoners. <br>
L'KOR: We lost our honour when we were captured. It does not matter
what happens to us. <br>
GI'RAL: All that matters is that our families are not dishonoured. <br>
L'KOR: Why did you come here? If you had found your father you would
have found only dishonour. <br>
WORF: If he had been captured as you were, if I had found him here, I
would be glad to see him. There is no room in my heart for shame. <br>
L'KOR: I can only hope that if my son came here, he would be Klingon
enough to kill me.

plot with a long, wicked-looking implement. Worf snatches it from him) <br>
WORF: This is a gin'tak spear. <br>
TOQ: What of it? <br>
WORF: Have your parents taught you nothing? This is used for battle,
not tilling soil. <br>
TOQ: We have no need for weapons here. The war is far away. <br>
WORF: What war? <br>
TOQ: The war our parents came here to escape. <br>
WORF: That war was over many years ago. <br>
TOQ: I'm not interested in what you have to say, Klingon. I have work
to do. <br>
(Worf walks on to another area, where the girl from the pond is
lounging) <br>
BA'EL: Hello again, Worf. They say you've come to stay with us. <br>
WORF: Not by choice. <br>
BA'EL: Aren't you happy to have escaped the war? <br>
WORF: The war. <br>
BA'EL: Yes. We've heard the stories all our lives. How people are
slaughtered in terrible battles, forced to fight whether they want to
or not. That's why our parents came here, to make a safe home, a place
where they could raise their children in peace. I should think you'd be
relieved to get away from the fighting. You're safe here. <br>
WORF: A place can be safe and still be a prison. Where I come from,
people are free to come and go as they choose. <br>
BA'EL: So are we. <br>
WORF: Tell your father that you would like to leave. Tell him that you
would like to visit the Klingon Home world. See what he says. <br>
BA'EL: Why would I want to go there? It's dangerous. <br>
WORF: Not any longer. <br>
GI'RAL: Ba'el! Come here! <br>
BA'EL: Yes, Mother. You are not allowed to leave the compound? Then I
suppose I won't be seeing you at the pond again. <br>

when there is a knock on the door) <br>
WORF: Enter. <br>

TOKATH: I am Tokath. I can return later if I am disturbing you? <br>
WORF: It is a strange thing when a jailer concerns himself with his
prisoner's comfort. <br>
TOKATH: Mine is a strange prison. <br>
WORF: You robbed the Klingons of who they were. You dishonoured them. <br>
TOKATH: By not slitting their throats when we found them unconscious? <br>
WORF: I do not expect you to understand. You are a Romulan. <br>
TOKATH: You're just like L'Kor was twenty years ago. Proud and angry.
He hated me. All the Klingons did. And I had no love for them, I won't
deny it. When I informed the High Command that the Klingons wanted to
remain here, I was told that unless I stayed to oversee them myself,
they would be killed. My decision ended my military career. <br>
WORF: Why did you do it? <br>
TOKATH: I don't expect you to understand. You're a Klingon. But I do
expect you to understand this, We've put aside the old hatreds. Here,
Romulans and Klingons live in peace. I won't allow you to destroy what
we have. <br>
WORF: Do not deceive yourself. These people are not happy here. I see
the sadness in their eyes. <br>
TOKATH: That's not what I see when I look in my wife's eyes. I married
a Klingon. So you see, when I warn you not to disrupt our lives here
I'm not speaking just as a jailer, but as a man protecting his family.
Do not test my tolerance.

WORF: Kahless held his father's lifeless body in his arms. He could not
believe what his brother had done. Then his brother threw their
father's sword into the sea, saying, if he could not possess it,
neither would Kahless. That was the last time the brothers would speak.
<br>
BA'EL: What happened to the sword? <br>
WORF: Kahless looked into the sea and wept, for the sword is all he had
left of his father. The ocean filled with his tears and flooded beyond
the shore. <br>
TOQ: That is impossible! <br>
WORF: For you, perhaps. Not Kahless. He was a great warrior. <br>

father's sword? <br>
WORF: Yes. He found it. <br>

WORF: I have studied them all of my life, and find new truths in them
every time. <br>

WORF: You are Romulan. <br>
BA'EL: Tokath is my father. I thought you knew that. <br>
WORF: How could your mother mate with a Romulan? <br>
BA'EL: Why shouldn't she? <br>
WORF: It is an obscenity. <br>
BA'EL: What are you saying? They love each other. <br>
WORF: Romulans are treacherous, deceitful. They are without honour. <br>
BA'EL: My father is a good man. He is kind, and generous. There is
nothing dishonourable about him. <br>
WORF: He took part in a cowardly attack at Khitomer. Thousands of
Klingons were massacred, many of them women and children. <br>
BA'EL: I don't know what you're talking about. My father came here to
escape the wars. He would never kill anybody. <br>

Do you know of any place, any time in history, when Klingons and
Romulans have lived together in peace? We have despised each other,
fought each other, for centuries. Except here, on this remote planet,
Romulans and Klingons live together in harmony. No government, no
leader, has ever done what I have done here. <br>
WORF: And what about Toq? I saw what happened to him when he caught the
scent of his prey on the wind. For the first time in his life, he felt
powerful, and that is what he has been denied living here. And that is
what you have tried to take away from him. Now you may be content to
sit here in the jungle and wither to old age, but Toq and the others
have tasted what it is to feel truly alive, and they will not give that
up now. <nr><br>

myself to justify whether it is right. And I have reached the
conclusion that it is absolutely necessary to put this man to death.
What we have built together would be destroyed by this man. And I
cannot allow that to happen. I give you one last chance to accept our
way of life. <br>
WORF: Those are eloquent word, Tokath, but the truth is, I am being
executed because I brought something dangerous to your young people.
Knowledge. Knowledge of their origins. Knowledge of the real reasons
you are here in this camp. The truth is a threat to you. <br>
TOKATH: Enough. Stand ready. Raise your weapons. <br>
BA'EL: Father. <br>
TOQ: Stop this! <br>
(Toq is wearing the old armour.) <br>
TOQ: If you kill him, you will have to kill me. <br>
TOKATH: Step aside, Toq. <br>
TOQ: Worf would rather die than accept this way of life. And so would
I. I want to leave, as do many others. You will have to kill us to keep
us here. <br>
WORF: You see, Tokath? It is already too late. <br>
TOKATH: I am warning you. Move aside, now. <br>
(Toq holds his ground) <br>
TOKATH: Stand ready. <br>
L'KOR: Toq. Move away. <br>
TOKATH: Take aim. <br>
(L'Kor goes and stands with Toq and Worf. Tokath draws his own weapon.
Other young people join the group. Finally Ba'el stands with Worf.) <br>
TOKATH: Ba'el. <br>
GI'RAL: Tokath. Long ago, when your captives asked to stay here, our
hope was to avoid dishonouring our children on the Home World. But
perhaps, over the years, we lost sight of our children that we raised
here. This is our prison. It should not be theirs. <br>
WORF: Years ago, your parents made a great sacrifice for the sake of
their families. Today, they do so again. For that, we must honour them.
You must promise them never reveal to their secret. No one must know of
this place. <br>
TOQ: A supply ship's due in a few days. They will take us. When they
arrive, Tokath will explain it to them. Then we will start a new life. </font></p>

Lieutenant Worf was cut short when we
received a cryptic message from him requesting a rendezvous with a
Romulan vessel. He has informed us we will be taking on passengers.

CRUSHER: It's good to see you. He seems fine. We're giving everyone a
thorough checkups in Sickbay. <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Doctor. <br>
(Crusher and Toq leave) <br>
PICARD: Welcome home, Mister Worf. <br>
WORF: Thank you, sir. <br>
PICARD: Picard to Bridge. Signal the Romulan ship that the last group
is on board. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: You found what you were looking for, Mister Worf? <br>
WORF: No, sir. There was no prison camp. Those young people are
survivors of a vessel that crashed in the Carraya system four years
ago. No one survived Khitomer. <br>
PICARD: I understand. </font> </p>
