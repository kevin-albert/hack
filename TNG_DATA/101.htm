Captain's log, stardate 41153.7. Our destination is planet Deneb Four,
beyond which lies the great unexplored mass of the galaxy. My orders
are to examine Farpoint, a starbase built there by the inhabitants of
that world. Meanwhile, I am becoming better acquainted with my new
command, this Galaxy Class USS Enterprise. I am still somewhat in awe
of its size and complexity. As for my crew, we are short in several key
positions, most notably a first officer, but I am informed that a
highly experienced man, one Commander William Riker, will be waiting to
join our ship at our Deneb Four destination.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: You will agree, Data, that Starfleet's
orders are difficult? <br>
DATA: Difficult? Simply solve the mystery of Farpoint Station. <br>
PICARD: As simple as that. <br>
TROI: Farpoint Station. Even the name sounds mysterious. <br>
PICARD: It's hardly simple, Data, to negotiate a friendly agreement for
Starfleet to use the base while at the same time snoop around finding
how and why the life form there built it. <br>
DATA: Inquiry. The word snoop? <br>
PICARD: Data, how can you be programmed as a virtual encyclopedia of
human information without knowing a simple word like snoop? <br>
DATA: Possibility, a kind of human behaviour I was not designed to
emulate. <br>
PICARD: It means to spy, to sneak. <br>
DATA: Ah! To seek covertly, to go stealthily, to slink, slither <br>
PICARD: Exactly, yes. <br>
DATA: Glide, creep, skulk, pussyfoot, gumshoe. <br>
TROI: Captain, I'm sensing a powerful mind. <br>
(Collision alert sounds)&nbsp;<br>
TORRES: Something strange on the detector circuits. <br>
(A massive barrier appears in front of them in space) <br>
DATA: It registers as solid, Captain. <br>
TROI: Or an incredibly powerful forcefield. But if we collide with
either it could be very <br>
PICARD: Shut off that damned noise. Go to Yellow Alert. <br>
WORF: Shields and deflectors up, sir. <br>
(The barrier ripples like chain mail) <br>
PICARD: Reverse power, full stop. <br>
TORRES: Controls to full stop, sir. Now reading full stop, sir. <br>
(There's a flash of light, and an Elizabethan era soldier appears,
complete with breast plate and plumed hat) <br>
Q: Thou are notified that thy kind hath infiltrated the galaxy too far
already. Thou art directed to return to thine own solar system
immediately. <br>
PICARD: That's quite a directive. Would you mind identifying what you
are? <br>
Q: We call ourselves the Q. Or thou mayst call me that. It's all much
the same thing. <br>
(The same force barrier stops two people exiting the turbolift) <br>
Q: I present myself to thee as a fellow ship captain, that thou mayst
better understand me. Go back whence thou camest. (to Helmsman) Stay
where thou art! <br>
(And the helmsman is frozen solid, phaser in hand) <br>
PICARD: Data, call medics. <br>
TROI: He's frozen. <br>
PICARD: He would not have injured you. Do you recognise this, the stun
setting? <br>
Q: Knowing humans as thou dost, Captain, wouldst thou be captured
helpless by them? Now, go back or thou shalt most certainly die. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, supplementary. The frozen form of
Lieutenant Torres has been rushed to sickbay. The question now is the
incredible power of the Q being. Do we dare oppose it? </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Q: Captain, thy little centuries go by so rapidly.
Perhaps thou will better understand this. <br>
(A flash of light and he is wearing a 20th century US military uniform,
with a cigarette in his hand) <br>
Q: Actually, the issue at stake is patriotism. You must return to your
world and put an end to the commies. All it takes is a few good men. <br>
PICARD: What? That nonsense is centuries behind us. <br>
Q: But you can't deny that you're still a dangerous, savage child race.
<br>
PICARD: Most certainly I deny it. I agree we still were when humans
wore costumes like that, four hundred years ago. <br>
Q: At which time you slaughtered millions in silly arguments about how
to divide the resources of
your little world. And four hundred years before that you were
murdering each other in quarrels over tribal god-images. Since there
are no indications that humans will ever change. <br>
PICARD: But even when we wore costumes like that we'd already started
to make rapid progress. <br>
Q: Oh yeah? You want to review your rapid progress? <br>
(Flash, and a change into a padded suit) <br>
Q: Rapid progress, to where humans learned to control their military
with drugs. <br>
WORF: Sir, sickbay reports Lieutenant Torres's condition is better. <br>
Q: Oh, concern for one's fellow comrade. How touching. <br>
WORF: And now a personal request, sir. Permission to clean up the
bridge. <br>
TASHA: Lieutenant Worf is right, sir. As Security Chief I can't just
stand here and let<br>
PICARD: Yes you can, Lieutenant Yar. <br>
Q: (taking a snort of something) Oh, better. And later, on finally
reaching deep space, humans of course found enemies to fight out there
too. And to broaden those struggles you again found allies for still
more murdering. The same old story, all over again. <br>
PICARD: No. The same old story is the one we're meeting now.
Self-righteous life forms who are eager not to learn but to prosecute,
to judge anything they don't understand or can't tolerate. <br>
Q: What an interesting idea. Prosecute and judge. Suppose it turns out
we understand you humans only too well. <br>
PICARD: We've no fear of what the true facts about us will reveal. <br>
Q: Facts about you? Splendid, splendid, Captain! You're a veritable
fountain of good ideas. There are preparations to make, but when we
next meet, Captain, we'll proceed exactly as you suggest. <br>
(A flash and he is gone) <br>
WORF: Sir, respectfully submit our only choice is to fight. <br>
TASHA: Fight, or try to escape. <br>
PICARD: Sense anything, Commander? <br>
TROI: Its mind is much too powerful. Recommend we avoid contact. <br>
PICARD: From this point, no station aboard, repeat no station, for any
reason will make use of transmitted signals or intercom. We'll try and
take them by surprise. Let's see what this galaxy class starship can
do. (to Worf) Lieutenant, inform engine room to prepare for maximum
acceleration. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Records search, Data. Results of detaching saucer section at
high warp velocity. <br>
DATA: Inadvisable at any warp speed, sir. <br>
PICARD: Search theoretical. <br>
DATA: It is possible, sir. But absolutely no margin for error. <br>
PICARD: Using print-out only, notify all decks to prepare for maximum
acceleration. Now hear this, Maximum, you're entitled to know, means
that we'll be pushing our engines well beyond safety limits. Our hope
is to surprise whatever that is out there, try and outrun it. Our only
other option is to tuck tail between our legs and return to Earth as
they demand. <br>
(Worf makes his trip to Engineering and back) <br>
WORF: Engine room ready, sir. <br>
TROI: The board shows green, Captain. All go. <br>
PICARD: Stand by. Engage. <br>
(They swoop along and past the barrier, which then turns into a ball
and chases them) <br>
WORF: Velocity warp nine point two. <br>
DATA: Heading three five one mark eleven, sir. <br>
PICARD: Steady on that. <br>
TASHA: The hostile is now giving chase, sir. Accelerating fast. <br>
WORF: We're now at warp nine point three, sir, which takes us past the
red line, sir. <br>
PICARD: Continue accelerating. Counsellor, at this point I'm open to
guesses about what we've just met. <br>
TROI: It it felt like something beyond what we'd consider a life form. <br>
PICARD: Beyond? <br>
TROI: Very, very advanced, sir, or certainly very, very different. <br>
WORF: We're at nine point four, sir. <br>
TASHA: Hostile is now beginning to overtake us, sir. <br>
PICARD: Are you sure? <br>
DATA: Hostile's velocity is already warp nine point six, sir. Shall I
put them on the main viewer? <br>
PICARD: Reverse angle. <br>
DATA: Magnifying viewer image. <br>
TASHA: Hostile's velocity is nine point seven, sir. <br>
PICARD: Worf, inform the engine room we need more. <br>
DATA: Engine room attempting to comply, sir, but they caution us <br>
PICARD: Go to yellow alert. Arm aft photon torpedoes. Place them on
ready status. <br>
TASHA: Torpedoes to ready, sir. <br>
TASHA: Hostile now at warp nine point eight, sir. <br>
WORF: Our velocity is only nine point five, sir. <br>
DATA: Projection, sir. We may be able to match hostile's nine point
eight, sir. But at extreme risk. <br>
TASHA: Now reading the hostile at warp nine point nine, sir. <br>
PICARD: Now hear this. Print-out message, urgent, all stations on all
decks. Prepare for emergency saucer sever. You will command the saucer
section, Lieutenant. <br>
WORF: I am a Klingon, sir. For me to seek escape when my Captain goes
into battle. <br>
PICARD: You are a Starfleet officer, Lieutenant. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>

I'm transferring command to the battle bridge. <bt>

The torpedoes detonate.) <br>
TASHA: Torpedoes have detonated, sir. <br>

their ship we'll have a chance <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant, are you recommending we fight a life form that can
do all those things? I'd like to hear your advice. <br>

distract them from going after the saucer. <br>

BAILIFF: The prisoners will all stand. <br>
(Picard sits down) <br>
DATA: Historically intriguing, Captain. Very, very accurate. <br>
PICARD: Mid twenty first century. The post-atomic horror. <br>
BAILIFF: All present, stand and make respectful attention to honoured
Judge. <br>
TROI: Careful, sir. This is not an illusion or a dream. <br>
PICARD: But these courts happened in the past. <br>
TROI: I don't understand either, but this is real. <br>
SOLDIER: Get to your feet, criminals! <br>
(From the distance, a spotlight reveals a figure approaching, dressed
in red, and sitting on a throne carried on hydraulics for effect) <br>
DATA: At least we are acquainted with the judge, Captain. <br>
(Q gestures the crowd to sit) <br>
SOLDIER: Attention! On your feet. Attention! <br>
(Tasha disarms him) <br>
Q: (to soldier) You are out of order. (another soldier kills him) The
prisoners will not be harmed until they are found guilty. Dispose of
that. <br>
PICARD: Can we assume you mean this will be a fair trial? <br>
Q: Yes, absolutely equitable. Proceed. <br>
BAILIFF: Before this gracious court now appear these prisoners to
answer for the multiple and grievous savageries of their species. How
plead you, criminal? <br>
DATA: If I may, Captain? Objection, your honour. In the year 2036, the
new United Nations declared that no Earth citizen
could be made to answer for the crimes of his race or forbears. <br>
Q (JUDGE): Objection denied. This is a court of the year 2079, by which
time more rapid progress had caused all United
Earth nonsense to be abolished. <br>
PICARD: Tasha, no. <br>
TASHA: I must! Because I grew up on a world that allowed things like
this court. And it was people like these that saved me from it. This
so-called court should get down on its knees to what Starfleet is, what
it represents. <br>
(Q freezes Tasha) <br>
TROI: You barbarian! This woman <br>
BAILIFF: Criminals keep silence! <br>
PICARD: You've got a lot to learn about humans if you think you can
torture us or frighten us into silence. Will she live? <br>
DATA: Uncertain. When he froze Lieutenant Torres on the Bridge, we had
our Sickbay to help thaw him out. <br>
BAILIFF: You will answer the charges, criminals. <br>
PICARD: Or what? Or this? Her death? Or worse? You promised the
prisoners will not be harmed. We plead nothing so long as you break
your own rules. <br>
Q: I suggest you centre your attention on this trial, Captain. It may
be your only hope. <br>
PICARD: I suggest you are now having second thoughts it. You are
considering that if you conduct a fair trial, which was your promise,
you may lose. <br>
Q: Lose? <br>
PICARD: Yes, even though you're judge and prosecutor. <br>
Q: And jury. <br>
PICARD: Accepted, so long as you keep to your agreement. And assaulting
prisoners is hardly a fair trial. <br>
Q: This is a merciful court. (Tasha is thawed) Silence! Continuing
these proceedings, I must caution you that legal trickery is not
permitted. This is a court of <br>
PICARD: court of fact! We humans know our past, even when we're ashamed
of it. I recognise this court system as the one that agreed with that
line from Shakespeare. <a href="http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/2kh6_4_2.html" target="_blank"> Kill all the
lawyers</a>. <br>
Q: Which was done. <br>
PICARD: Which led to the rule guilty until proven innocent. <br>
Q: Of course. Bringing the innocent to trial would be unfair. You will
now answer to the charge of being a grievously savage race. <br>
PICARD: Grievously savage could mean anything. I will answer only
specific charges. <br>
Q: Are you certain you want a full disclosure of human ugliness? So be
it, fool! Present the charges. <br>
BAILIFF: Criminal, you will read the charges to the court. <br>
(Picard takes his time to read the pad that is handed to him, then
gives it back) <br>
PICARD: I see no charges against us, Your Honour. <br>
Q: You are out of order! <br>
(Guns are placed at Data and Troi's heads) <br>
Q: Soldiers, you will press those triggers if this criminal answers
with any word other than guilty. Criminal, how plead you? <br>
PICARD: Guilty. Provisionally. <br>
Q: The Court will hear the provision. <br>
PICARD: We question whether this court is abiding by its own trial
instructions. Have I have permission to have Commander Data repeat the
record? <br>
Q: There will be no legal trickery <br>
PICARD: These will be your own words, your Honour. What exactly what
followed his Honour's statement that the prisoner will not be harmed? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. The Captain had asked the question. Can we assume you
mean this will be a fair trial? And in reply the judge stated, yes,
absolutely equitable. <br>
Q: Irrelevant testimony, entirely irrelevant. <br>
PICARD: Alright! We agree there is evidence to support the court's
contention that humans have been savage. Therefore I say test us. Test
whether this is presently true of humans. <br>
Q: I see, I see. And so you petition the Court to accept you and your
comrades as proof of what humanity has become. <br>
PICARD: There must be many ways we can be tested. We have a long
mission ahead of us. <br>
Q: Another brilliant suggestion, Captain. But your test hardly requires
a long mission. Your immediate destination offers far more challenge
than you can possibly imagine. Yes, this Farpoint station will be an
excellent test. <br>
BAILIFF: All present, respectfully stand. <br>
Q: This trial is adjourned, to allow the criminals to be tested. <br>
BAILIFF: This honourable court is adjourned. Stand respectfully. <br>
Q: Captain, you may find you are not nearly clever enough to deal with
what lies ahead for you. It may have been better to accept sentence
here.

ZORN: Geothermal energy is the one great blessing of this planet. I'll
have all the details of that sent to your quarters. <br>

have constructed this station so rapidly and so, so perfectly suited to

Q [on monitor]: And four hundred years before that, you were murdering
each other in quarrels over tribal god images. Since then there are no
indications that humans will ever change. There are preparations to
make, and when we next meet, Captain, we'll proceed exactly as you
suggest. <br>

PICARD: I do have some questions for you though.&nbsp;<br>
RIKER: Yes, sir, I thought you might. <br>
PICARD: I see in your file that Captain DeSoto thinks very highly of
you. One curious thing, however, you refused to let him beam down to
Altair Three. <br>
RIKER: In my opinion, sir, Altair Three was too dangerous to risk
exposing the Captain. <br>
PICARD: I see. A Captain's rank means nothing to you. <br>
RIKER: Rather the reverse, sir. But a Captain's life means a great deal
to me. <br>
PICARD: Isn't it just possible that you don't get to be a Starfleet
Captain without knowing whether it's safe to beam down or not? Isn't it
a little presumptuous of a first officer to second guess his captain's
judgment? <br>
RIKER: Permission to speak candidly, sir? <br>
PICARD: Always. <br>
RIKER: Having been a first officer yourself, you know that assuming
that responsibility must by definition include the safety of the
captain. I have no problem with following any rules you lay down, short
of compromising your safety. <br>
PICARD: And you don't intend to back off that position? <br>
RIKER: No, sir, <br>
PICARD: One further thing. A special favour. <br>
RIKER: Anything, sir. <br>
PICARD: Using the same kind of strength you showed with Captain DeSoto,
I would appreciate it if you can keep me from making an ass of myself
with children. <br>
RIKER: Sir? <br>
PICARD: I'm not a family man, Riker, and yet, Starfleet has given me a
ship with children aboard. <br>
RIKER: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: And I don't feel comfortable with children. But, since a
captain needs an image of geniality, you're to see that's what I
project. <br>

Enormous satisfaction. <br>
PICARD: From the same source as before? <br>
TROI: No, that was on the planet. This is much closer. <br>
Q: Excellent, Counsellor. He's such a dullard, isn't he? <br>

have beamed aboard. <br>

PICARD: An agreement which you are at this moment breaking by taking
over our vessel, interfering with my decisions. Either leave or finish
us. <br>
Q: Temper, temper, mon Capitaine. I'm merely trying to assist a pitiful
species. But perhaps I will leave if Commander Riker provides me with
some amusement. <br>

Q (JUDGE): But I ask so little, and it's so necessary if you're to
solve all this. Beam over there with your what do you call it? Your
away team. <br>
PICARD: I'll risk none of my crew on that unknown. <br>

adult a puzzle for you. <br>

you come to me on the Bridge. I yelled at your son. Who, as you pointed
out, was quite correct. He does seem to have a very good grasp of
starship operations. <br>

PICARD: Ah, but, now, your assignment here. I would consider and
approve you a transfer for you. <br>

PICARD: Hardly. Your service record shows you're just the Chief Medical
Officer I want. <br>

to work with a commanding officer who would continually remind you of a
