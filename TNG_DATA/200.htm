Captain's log, stardate 44995.3. We're en route to the Klingon home
world, where I will participate in the installation ceremony of Gowron,
the next designated Leader of the High Council. This visit should also
provide an opportunity for one of my officers to correct a grave
injustice.

WORF: Enter. <br>
PICARD: Am I intruding? <br>
WORF: No, sir. My apologies, Captain. I can be back in uniform <br>
PICARD: No, that won't be necessary, Mister Worf. I'm not here as your
captain. I'm here as the man who stood with you before the High
Council. Your cha'DIch. We will arrive at your home world in less than
a day. <br>
WORF: It is not time yet. <br>
PICARD: That doesn't sound like the man who came to me a year ago
fiercely determined to return home and to clear his father's name or
die trying. Isn't it time to confront the Council? To regain your
family name? Let the truth be known? <br>
WORF: I have been told that patience is sometimes a more effective
weapon than the sword. <br>
PICARD: Patience is a human virtue, one which I am glad to see you've
taken to heart. But doesn't this situation require a more Klingon
response? Your discommendation is a facade to protect less honourable
men. It is a lie. Lies must be challenged. <br>
WORF: I have grown weary of bearing this dishonour. <br>

GOWRON [on viewscreen]: I must speak with you, Picard. We will have to
move quickly if we are to be successful. <br>
PICARD: Successful? <br>
GOWRON [on viewscreen]: Yes. In preventing a Klingon civil war.

They have many allies on the Council. <br>
PICARD: Duras died in disgrace. By Klingon tradition, his family should
share that disgrace. <br>
GOWRON: Their corruption has poisoned the Empire. Honour will soon have
no meaning. <br>
PICARD: And who speaks for his family now? <br>
GOWRON: Lursa and B'Etor, the sisters of Duras. <br>
PICARD: And they would claim the leadership of the Council? <br>
GOWRON: Women may not serve on the Council. <br>
PICARD: Then how <br>
GOWRON: I don't know. But they are plotting something. They have
secured the loyalty of at least three fleet commanders. Lursa and
B'Etor are feared, and fear is power. <br>
PICARD: I do not see what I can do to assist. <br>
GOWRON: You were first chosen as Arbiter of Succession because no
Klingon could be trusted. You accepted this duty and you must see it
through to the end. You must ensure my installation. <br>
PICARD: That is beyond my purview. <br>
GOWRON: You will not support me? <br>
PICARD: I will not step outside the traditional role of the Arbiter. <br>
GOWRON: And if they attempt to block my installation? <br>
PICARD: Then I can only assure you that I will deal with any challenge
according to Klingon law. <br>
GOWRON: I fear that will not be enough.

Mister Data. Have the outpost stations send us their tactical reports. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: The Duras family are preparing to move against Gowron. <br>
RIKER: Backed by Romulans? <br>

(the transporter technician leaves) <br>
WORF: I would speak with you. <br>
GOWRON: I do not hear the words of traitors. <br>
WORF: I am not a traitor. <br>
GOWRON: You admitted your guilt before the Council. <br>
WORF: I accepted discommendation to protect the Empire. <br>
GOWRON: Protect it? How? <br>
WORF: It was Duras' father who betrayed our people to the Romulans at
Khitomer, not mine. <br>
GOWRON: Duras? There is proof of this? <br>
WORF: There is. <br>
GOWRON: Why would you accept dishonour to protect Duras? <br>
WORF: His family was too powerful. To expose him would have split the
Empire. Instead, the Council chose to blame my father. <br>
GOWRON: The Council knew? <br>
WORF: I believe you to be a man of honour, Gowron. I ask you, restore
my family name. <br>
GOWRON: Worf, you killed Duras. I consider that no small favour. But
what you ask is impossible. <br>
WORF: But after your installation <br>
GOWRON: The grasp of Duras reaches out from the grave. Much of the
Council is still loyal to his family. I must have the Council's support
to survive. I cannot expose their treachery. You chose to accept this
disgrace for the good of the Empire. Now you must live with your
decision, like a Klingon.

WORF: Klingons do not laugh. <br>

some Klingon belly laughs that would curl your hair. <br>
(Guinan gets three hits, Worf gets two hits and a miss) <br>
GUINAN: Your son laughs. He's a Klingon. <br>
WORF: He is a child and part human. <br>
GUINAN: That's right. And you're not, you're full Klingon except you
don't laugh. <br>
WORF: I do not laugh because I do not feel like laughing. <br>
GUINAN: Other Klingons feel like laughing. What does that say about
you? <br>
WORF: Perhaps it says that I do not feel like other Klingons. <br>

GUINAN: Good game. Don't feel bad. I was doing this long before you

with humans, being Klingon. Could be very confusing. <br>

it's like to really be a Klingon. Just as you're learning.

WORF: Too long. We have much to discuss. I have asked Gowron to restore
our family honour. He has refused. <br>
KURN: Gowron will not live to see the day he leads the Council. <br>
WORF: What do you mean? <br>
KURN: He stands alone, surrounded by his enemies. Lursa and B'Etor will
have him killed. And if they don't, I will. <br>
WORF: You will? <br>
KURN: Gowron is weak. The family of Duras must never be allowed to lead
the Council. Our leaders have failed us. They no longer deserve our
loyalty. It is time to sweep away the old Council and put a new one in
its place. <br>
WORF: How can this be done? <br>
KURN: I already have the support of four squadron commanders in key
strategic sectors. When the time comes, they will follow me. Join us,
Worf, and we will usher in a new era and regain our family name. <br>
(Worf thinks about it) <br>
WORF: No. <br>
KURN: What? <br>
WORF: Gowron has completed the Rite of Succession. It is our duty to
support him. <br>
KURN: Gowron spits in your face when you ask him to give back what is
rightfully ours and you would support him? <br>
WORF: We cannot regain honour by acting dishonourably. <br>
KURN: I will not support Gowron. <br>
WORF: I am the elder brother, Kurn. I speak for our family. We will
back Gowron. But not now. Not yet. We will wait until he feels the
grasp of his enemies around his throat. Then we will offer him our
support. And the price will be the restoration of our family name. <br>
KURN: It will be difficult to convince my allies to back Gowron. But I
will try. I must go to the Mempa sector to meet with the other squadron
commanders. <br>
WORF: Contact me when you have gained their support. Then I will be
ready for Gowron.

LURSA: Members of the High Council, it is a day of great rejoicing for
the family of Duras and the Klingon Empire. We have discovered that our
brother did indeed have a son and heir. <br>
GOWRON: This is outrageous. Duras had no mate. Where did you find him,
Lursa? In a harlot's bedchamber? <br>

innocence. Those Federation records can do that. <br>

wish to allow the Duras family to solidify their hold on the Council?
Do you think I cannot see for myself the implications for the
Federation? Good Lord, Duras tried to have me killed! All of my
instincts, my training, my very being as a Starfleet officer are at
odds with my responsibilities as Arbiter of the Klingon High Council.

the two of you will very quickly gain control of the Council and Gowron
will be found dead shortly thereafter. If I reject Toral's claim, you
will accuse me of serving Federation interests. It will serve as a
rallying cry to declare war and overthrow Gowron. <br>

rule against us and we are victorious in a war against Gowron. <br>

PICARD: K'Tal, this Council knows the law of heredity well. G'now juk
Hol pajhard. A son shall share in the honours or crimes of his father.
Toral is Duras' son. That has been established by the genetic scan. But
with due respect to the traditions and laws of this High Council, there
is no basis for accepting a petition for leadership from a boy who has
fought no battles, shed no blood for his people, or earned no honour
for himself. One day, perhaps he shall. But not now. Duras is dead. His
claim to the leadership died with him. Gowron shall lead the Council. <br>

No, that will not be enough. The Duras family controls most of the

PICARD: If we go to the aid of the Bortas, we'll be dragging the
Federation into a Klingon civil war. <br>
RIKER: What about Worf? <br>
PICARD: Ensign, engage.

near Beta Thoridar. As per the terms of the Treaty of Alliance, I now
formally request your assistance in fighting these enemies of the
Empire. <br>
RIKER: These enemies are Klingons. <br>
GOWRON: By right and tradition, I am the sole leader. All who oppose me
are traitors. <br>
PICARD: I understand your position, but I', sure you're aware that the
Federation cannot interfere in what is, by definition, an internal
Klingon affair. <br>
GOWRON: You arbitrated the Rite of Succession. You are already
involved. <br>
PICARD: My duties in that regard are finished. <br>
WORF: Captain, we must intervene. The Duras family is corrupt and
hungry for power with no sense of honour or loyalty. They represent a
grave threat to the security of the Federation. Captain, you and I know
that they have conspired with Romulans in the past. If they should be
victors in this war, they will surely form a new Klingon-Romulan
alliance. That would represent a fundamental shift of power in this
quadrant. Starfleet must support Gowron. It is in the interests of both
the Federation and the Empire. I beg you, support us in our cause. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, I don't have to lecture you on the principle of
non interference. As Starfleet officers, we have all sworn an oath to
uphold that principle whatever our personal feelings. I'm sorry. I must
refuse your request. <br>
(Worf starts to follow Gowron out of the room) <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf. I'm afraid I must recall you to duty. The
Enterprise will be leaving this sector immediately. <br>
WORF: Captain, I respectfully request that I be allowed to take an
extended leave of absence. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, your responsibilities as a Starfleet officer are
incompatible with remaining on board a Klingon ship during a time of
war. <br>
WORF: Captain. <br>
PICARD: I order you to return to duty at once. <br>

WORF: As weapons officer. <br>
PICARD: Your tactical knowledge and experience will serve them well. <br>
WORF: Thank you, sir. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, are you certain that this is the right decision? <br>
WORF: I was rescued from Khitomer by humans. Raised and loved by human
parents. I've spent most of my life around humans, fought beside them.
But I was born a Klingon. My heart is of that world. I do hear the cry
of the warrior. I belong with my people. <br>
PICARD: Being the only Klingon ever to serve in Starfleet gave you a
singular distinction, but I felt that what was unique about you was
your humanity, compassion, generosity, fairness. You took the best
qualities of humanity and made them part of you. The result was a man
who I was proud to call one of my officers. I'll have your belongings
transported to the Bortas. <br>
