Captain's log, stardate 42609.1. In response to a desperate plea for
aid by my old friend, Captain Donald Varley of the USS Yamato, I am
running a grave risk by taking the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone.
Varley's request was prompted by dangerous malfunctions which have been
plaguing our sister ship. Perhaps with both crews working together we
can able to eliminate the problems before our presence is detected by
the Romulans.

WESLEY: Four minutes and thirty three seconds, sir. <br>
PICARD: Status of download, Mister Data? <br>
DATA: The Yamato log should be in our computer by rendezvous, sir. <br>
RIKER: Have you nailed down our little hiccup yet? <br>
DATA: Sir? <br>
RIKER: The odd reading? <br>
DATA: No, sir. It might be due to problems currently being experienced
by the Yamato. <br>
PICARD: Trouble, Number One? <br>
RIKER: I'm not sure, sir. Are we alone out here, Worf? <br>
WORF: Yes, sir. There are no other vessels in the area except the
Yamato, which is coming into visual range now. <br>
PICARD: At last. <br>
WORF: Transmission from the Yamato, sir. <br>
PICARD: On viewer. <br>
(A tired looking Captain sits in his seat) <br>
PICARD: Donald, what's a nice Starfleet Captain like you doing in a
place like this? <br>
VARLEY [on viewscreen]: It's good to see you again, Jean-Luc, despite
your antique humour. I only hope your people are able to help us.
Malfunctions are becoming serious. We lost an engineering team when the
computer shut down a forcefield in an open shuttlebay. Eighteen people.
<br>
RIKER: Do you have any idea what caused this, sir? <br>
VARLEY [on viewscreen]: None. They are affecting every system
simultaneously. It's like the ship has suddenly decided to fall apart.
It's beginning to make me think we should have run these Galaxy Class
ships across a few more drawing boards before we built one. <br>
PICARD: You believe it's a design flaw? <br>
VARLEY [on viewscreen]: I don't know. I'm grasping at straws here. All
I know is we've got to get it fixed, and before I lose more than an
engineering team. <br>
RIKER: Do you wish to evacuate any non-essential personnel to the
Enterprise, sir? <br>
VARLEY [on viewscreen]: No. No, that would be premature. <br>
PICARD: Donald, we'll get our teams to work on it immediately. I'm sure
neither of us feels too comfortable sitting around in the Neutral Zone.
<br>
VARLEY [on viewscreen]: I know what you're thinking, what the hell am I
doing here? Well, I had heard rumours about a couple of archaeological
digs that started making the Iconians sound a lot less like legend. I
did a little investigating, and I located their homeworld. <br>
PICARD: In the Neutral Zone? <br>
VARLEY [on viewscreen]: In the Neutral Zone. <br>
PICARD: Donald, that was quite a risk to run to satisfy archaeological
curiosity. <br>
VARLEY [on viewscreen]: The risk would be in allowing the Romulans to
locate Iconia. Fortunately, I got there first. It's a virtually dead
planet, but enough technology remains to give the Romulans an edge if
they should find it. <br>
(The picture starts to break up) <br>
PICARD: Donald, your transmission is breaking up. Mister Data, try and
clean that up. <br>
WORF: Sir, there is an energy build-up in the Yamato's Engineering
section. <br>
PICARD: Yamato, this is the Enterprise. Yamato, come in. <br>
WORF: Captain, magnetic seals in the antimatter chamber are decaying! <br>
PICARD: Captain! Donald, come in! <br>

glides to the right and burns up) <br>

Romulan.

TARIS [on viewscreen]: Captain Picard. <br>
PICARD: Explain your illegal presence in the Neutral Zone. <br>
TARIS [on viewscreen]: Explain yours. <br>
PICARD: Are you responsible for the destruction of the Yamato? <br>
TARIS [on viewscreen]: No. But believe me, Captain, had we chosen to
exercise our right to defend the Neutral Zone, we would not have
stopped with one starship. You will leave at once. <br>
WORF: Mute. <br>
PICARD: Comments. <br>
TROI: She's extremely anxious. <br>
WORF: Understandable if she just destroyed a Federation starship. <br>
RIKER: Your scan was inconclusive. We don't know what happened to the
Yamato. <br>
TROI: Our presence in the Neutral Zone is provocative. It could force
her to respond. <br>
WORF: Open. <br>
PICARD: We will comply when I have determined the cause of the
destruction of the Yamato, and when I am fully satisfied that you were
not responsible. Picard out. <br>
WORF: They are engaging their cloaking device. <br>
RIKER: Good. They can't fire when they're cloaked. <br>
WORF: Unless they have overcome that deficiency. The Yamato was
destroyed while they were cloaked. <br>
PICARD: Enough. Answers. I want answers, not conjecture. Number One, I
want them at a staff meeting in one hour. <br>
RIKER: Aye, sir.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Geordi is doing a presentation at the wall
monitor, using a schematic of the Yamato) <br>
LAFORGE: Sensor recordings reveal that what we witnessed was an
uncontrolled and catastrophic matter-antimatter mix. The magnetic seals
between the chambers collapsed and <br>
PICARD: Wait. Wait. That's not possible. <br>
LAFORGE: Yes, sir, it is, but a highly improbable series of events has
to take place for such a result to occur. <br>
PICARD: Explain. <br>
LAFORGE: Okay. In the event of a breach of seal integrity there's an
emergency release system which dumps the antimatter.
DATA: Apparently such a dump began, was then halted, and the
containment seals were dropped. There was still sufficient antimatter
present to lead to an explosion. <br>
PICARD: And so there is no evidence that a weapon was used? <br>
DATA: No, sir. None. <br>
LAFORGE: However it happened, the Yamato did it to herself. <br>
PICARD: Theorise. What could have caused such a catastrophic
malfunction? <br>
LAFORGE: I think Captain Varley may have been right. There may be a
design flaw. <br>
RIKER: In a Galaxy Class starship? <br>
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. It's the most sophisticated piece of machinery ever
built. Something could have been overlooked. <br>
PICARD: Knowing where the flaw is located, can you isolate the problem
and solve it? <br>
LAFORGE: We're already working on it, sir. <br>
PICARD: Pull any personnel you can use. <br>
(The men leave) <br>
TROI: If we have established that the Romulans were not responsible for
the destruction of the Yamato, would it not be prudent to withdraw? <br>
PICARD: If it is a design flaw, we're better to stay where we are and
give Geordi time to work on it. Or what happened to the Yamato could
happen to us.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Computer, access Captain Donald Varley's
personal log. Search parameter. Locate entries containing words Romulan
and or Iconia. <br>
COMPUTER: Working. <br>
VARLEY [on monitor]: Personal log. It was kind of Doctor Ramsey to
allow me to carry away my own little piece of legend from the
archaeological dig at Denius Three. My engineers have examined it, but
are completely baffled by its technology. What was its purpose? I'm
like a caveman confronted by a tricorder. I'm certain this device is
Iconian, but how far had it travelled before it was abandoned on this
alien world? (Second entry) Personal log. A galactic Rosetta stone. The
starfields on the artefact were unintelligible until I took into
account two hundred millennia of stellar drift. After that it was easy
to pinpoint Iconia. (Third entry) My First Officer is questioning the
wisdom of my order to violate the Neutral Zone, but I am convinced that
I have taken the only proper course. Should this advanced technology
fall into the hands of the Romulans, we might as well dock our ships
and defend ourselves with sticks. (Fourth entry) Personal log. We've
been spotted by a Romulan cruiser, but after playing hide and seek
through several solar systems, I think I've managed to elude them.
(Fifth entry) The Iconian probe scan. Was it an attempt at
communication? If only I knew what we were dealing with here.
(Sixth entry) Personal log. I'm unable to send an away team to the
surface of Iconia, nor can I scan the energy source on the planet
because of these maddening system failures. It's infuriating to be
stopped at the threshold of a dream by one's own ship. We're leaving
orbit to rendezvous with Picard. If his people can't help us repair the
Yamato, I must convince him to continue this exploration. The future
wellbeing of the Federation may well depend upon it. <br>

PICARD: Yes, of course. Well, what is it, Wesley? <br>
WESLEY: It's about the Iconians, sir. I was told they were just a myth.
<br>
PICARD: China was thought to be only a myth until Marco Polo travelled
there. No, the Iconians were certainly real. Sit down. We know that
three systems within this sector had a number of cultural similarities.
Similarities which could only be explained by there being a single
unifying influence. <br>
WESLEY: So they colonised those worlds? <br>
PICARD: Probably conquered. <br>
WESLEY: You mean they were warlike? <br>
PICARD: Perhaps. Ancient texts did speak of 'Demons of Air and
Darkness'. <br>
WESLEY: Air and darkness? <br>
PICARD: Legend has it that they travelled without the benefit of
spaceships, merely appearing out of thin air on distant planets. <br>
WESLEY: Sounds like magic. <br>
PICARD: Well, we would appear magical to Stone Age people. <br>
WESLEY: How did you find all this out? <br>
PICARD: Archaeology has been a hobby since Academy days. But why don't
we talk about what really brought you here? <br>
WESLEY: It's the Yamato, Captain. I can't stop thinking about her. All
those people dead. I don't know how you and Commander Riker and Geordi,
how you handle it so easily. <br>
PICARD: Easily? Oh no, not easily. We handle it because we're trained
to, as you will be. Tea, Earl Grey, hot. But if the time ever comes
when the death of a single individual fails to move us (a pot plant
appears in the replicator) <br>
WESLEY: Didn't you order tea, sir? <br>

alien computer programme. The same
programme that is currently aboard the Enterprise trying to rewrite our
software in its own image. We have two completely incompatible computer
systems trying to interact. <br>
RIKER: So that's why the ship's instruments have become so erratic. <br>

PICARD: What can you do? <br>

never understand it. <br>

ours, and in less than seven hours has managed to not only learn our
systems, but has begun to reprogram our computer. <br>
PICARD: And so the earlier probe was responsible for the Yamato's
destruction? <br>
LAFORGE: Yes, but only in as much as it was the probe that transmitted
the programme. <br>
RIKER: But we weren't scanned by that probe. How did this thing get
aboard the Enterprise? <br>
DATA: We downloaded the Yamato log, and contained in the log was the
programme. <br>
PICARD: Why didn't we suffered the same fate? <br>
LAFORGE: The programme affected all of the Yamato's systems
simultaneously. But with us, it was deposited within a specific section
of our mainframe, so it's having to work its way out from that
location. That gives us a little breathing space. <br>

RIKER: In case it should become necessary to fight, could you arrange
to find me some rocks to throw at them? <br>
WILLIAMS: Sir, the Romulan torpedoes are continuing to arm and disarm. <br>
RIKER: Maybe its attempt to fire was unintentional. Open hailing
frequencies. <br>
WILLIAMS: Open. <br>
RIKER: Romulan vessel, this is Commander William Riker, First Officer
of the USS Enterprise. Why did you attempt to fire on us? <br>
TARIS [on viewscreen]: This is Sub-Commander Taris of the Haakona. Why
have you penetrated deeper into the Neutral Zone? <br>
RIKER: Why are you still here? <br>
TARIS [on viewscreen]: I have claimed this planet for the Romulan
Empire. <br>
RIKER: This is the Neutral Zone. Nobody can claim anything. <br>
TARIS [on viewscreen]: You will withdraw or I will be forced to destroy
your ship and your away team. <br>
(Transmission ends, the Romulan ship starts to cloak then decloaks
again) <br>
RIKER: What the hell? <br>
TARIS [on viewscreen]: (through static) This is your final warning, I
will not <br>
(The picture clears up, but something else is going on off screen) <br>
RIKER: Having a little trouble with your systems, Commander? Maybe we
could consider postponing the war until we solve our more immediate
problem? <br>
TARIS [on viewscreen]: You're stalling for time. <br>
WESLEY: Sir, another probe launched from the planet, heading toward the
Romulans. <br>
RIKER: Have we got our phasers back? <br>
WILLIAMS: No, sir. <br>
RIKER: Taris, if you've got phaser capability, prepare use them now! <br>
TARIS [on viewscreen]: What? <br>
RIKER: Destroy that probe! <br>
(Transmission ends, the probe gets blown up) <br>
RIKER: And not even a thank you. <br>
TROI: Sub-Commander Taris is deeply frustrated, probably because her
ship is as crippled as the Enterprise. <br>
WESLEY: Why would the Romulans be experiencing problems? They weren't
probed. <br>
RIKER: They must have tapped into the Yamato log. Taris got a whole lot
more than she bargained for. Maintain Red Alert. Try to keep those
shields up in case Taris decides to act on her threat. <br>
WESLEY: Commander, what about the away team? With the shields up, we
can't beam them back.

see what sense we can make of this. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: This is very reminiscent of Dinasian. <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. There are also similarities to Dewan and Iccobar. <br>
PICARD: Is it possible that they could be branches of the same language
family, beginning with Iconian? <br>
DATA: It is, sir. <br>
PICARD: Run a comparison using basic simple words from Dinasian, Dewan
and Iccobar. See if we can reconstruct a common root language. <br>

RIKER: All right. Let's consider evacuation. <br>
TROI: To the planet? <br>
RIKER: I know it's probably impossible with Taris sitting out there,
but it would give everyone something to do. You go and organise it. <br>
TROI: But you might need me if you have to negotiate with Taris again. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Iconian Control room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Captain, your original hypothesis is correct.
Iconian is the parent tongue of a language family which consists of
Iccobar, Dewan and Dinasian. I have constructed a basic working
understanding through a comparison of common root words such as mother,
father, child, home, tribe, food, life, death, yours, ours, mine <br>
PICARD: Data, Data, Data. <br>
DATA: You do understand, sir, that my interpretation of the symbols
will not be exact? <br>
PICARD: Yes. Let's get on with it. <br>
DATA: This would appear to be manual override. <br>
(He presses the key pad, the globe comes to life and sends an energy
beam to the wall. Other beams join in to create a rectangular 3D image
of a coast scene) <br>
DATA: That was not manual override. <br>
PICARD: Demons of Air and Darkness, indeed. <br>
(The coast becomes the Acropolis, or similar) <br>
WORF: What is that? <br>
PICARD: A gateway? <br>
WORF: These scenes could be holographic images. <br>
(Data goes towards it) <br>
PICARD: Be careful. <br>
(Data sticks his arm into the image. Picard pulls him back) <br>
PICARD: Data! That was very foolish. <br>
DATA: But we have established that this is not a holograph. If I step
through and investigate, we could determine whether it is truly a
gateway. <br>
PICARD: No, Data. You might not be able to get back, and I can't risk
losing you. <br>
WORF: If it is not illusion, this gate would seem to take us beyond the
confines of this planet. <br>
PICARD: Is this how the Iconians travelled? Crossing light years as
easily as we would cross a room? Those places could be on worlds in
distant sectors of the galaxy. I think the Iconians might have
out-foxed their enemies. Maybe they didn't all die in the bombardment.
Some of them could have passed through this. This is what Varley
feared. This is what he died for. <br>
WORF: Sir? <br>
PICARD: The Romulans could use this technology as a weapon. <br>
WORF: Like the Iconians did. <br>
DATA: No, I disagree. Captain, there is nothing in this room to
indicate it was used as a military command centre. Perhaps a
transporter room? <br>
WORF: But the probe was hostile. <br>
PICARD: We can't make that assumption. The effect on the Yamato was
devastating, but what if it was by accident, not by design. What I'm
going to say may sound unscientific, but standing on this soil,
breathing in this air, my instincts tell me that we may have got them
wrong. <br>
WORF: But we do know that the Iconians were conquerors. <br>
PICARD: But that knowledge was passed down by the descendants of those
who attacked this world. The victors invariably write the history to
their own advantage. There is an unfortunate tendency in many cultures
to fear what they do not understand. It's possible that their enemies,
confronted with this technology, were driven to attack the Iconians out
of fear. <br>
(An image of the Bridge appears) <br>
WORF: Sir! <br>
(And is replaced by a skyscraper) <br>
WORF: Was that really the Enterprise? <br>
PICARD: I believe that it was. Gentlemen, we have a way home. <br>
DATA: Captain, there is a vast underground power source which is
controlled by this console. I believe my triggering of the gateway has
caused a dramatic upsurge in power level. Ah, I have access. <br>
(He starts tapping at the console, and the energy beam zaps him. Worf
catches Data as he falls backwards) <br>
PICARD: Data, can you hear me? Data, respond. <br>
DATA: Captain. <br>
WORF: Are you all right? <br>
DATA: No, I am damaged. <br>
PICARD: How bad is it? <br>
DATA: The Iconian programme is attempting to rewrite my software.
Physical manifestations, blindness, motor con <br>
WORF: Sir, without him we have no hope of deciphering the programme.
Captain, the Enterprise again. <br>
PICARD: How long is the interval? <br>
WORF: About four minutes, if the cycle holds. <br>
PICARD: The next time the Enterprise appears, go through it with Data.
Geordi will be able to learn from him. Maybe help him. <br>
WORF: Sir, we have not yet established that that is truly a gateway. <br>
PICARD: This will be the test. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Destroy the tricorder. <br>
WORF: Sir, it contains everything we've discovered up to this point. <br>
PICARD: And that is precisely why it must be destroyed. How long? <br>
WORF: About three minutes. <br>
PICARD: I'm running out of time. We all are. Data. Data, I have to
destroy this. This control room and its technology must not be allowed
to fall into Romulan hands. <br>
DATA: I understand, sir. <br>
PICARD: How! How do I do it? How do I destroy everything? The control
room, the probes, all of it. <br>
(Worf phasers the tricorder) <br>
DATA: The power source, sir. <br>
PICARD: I detonate it. But how? How do I do that? <br>
DATA: The probes, sir. <br>
PICARD: Probes? The probes. Launch? I launch the probes? But why?
What's good will that do? <br>
DATA: The doors, sir. <br>
PICARD: Doors? <br>
WORF: Perhaps the probes are in a launch bay. <br>
PICARD: And if the doors are closed, then the backwash from the rockets
will spill into the power grids and there'll be an overload. <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: But the doors will open automatically when the launch begins.
And I will override. <br>
DATA: Correct, sir. <br>
PICARD: Which control keys? Damn. Of course, you can't see. <br>
DATA: Help. <br>
PICARD: Worf, help him up. <br>
DATA: Describe, please. <br>
PICARD: I'm standing directly in front of the gate. To my left there is
a small triangular screen. <br>
DATA: Right one metre. <br>
PICARD: Right. Now, to my right is a larger triangular screen. The top
is solid amber. To the left, red. <br>
DATA: Correct. Key blue, amber, amber, red. <br>
PICARD: That's the launch sequence? How do I override the doors? <br>
DATA: Blue, blue, blue. <br>
PICARD: I hope that's not a stutter. I don't know how long a delay
there will be between the launch and the detonation. I'll hold keying
the launch sequence until you're through the gate. How long until the
Enterprise reappears? <br>
WORF: Almost time. Captain, you will be killed. <br>
PICARD: I'll go through the gate. <br>
WORF: But where will you end up? <br>
PICARD: Very shortly, anywhere will be preferable to this room. Mister
Worf, I am depending on you. You must get Data back to the Enterprise.
He may be their only hope. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>

RIKER: Geordi, this is critical. How? <br>
LAFORGE: Okay, give me a second to think. There was an incompatible
programme running through Data's system, so the mechanism started
searching for a way to keep him alive. The solution. The solution was a
shutdown and a total wipe of all affected memory. <br>
DATA: Query. What have I forgotten? <br>
RIKER: Can you do the same thing with the Enterprise? <br>
LAFORGE: I don't see why not, but it will have to be a complete
shutdown. We turn her off, and effect a wipe of the Yamato log
including every subsequent event since we downloaded it. I'll then be
able to reload all the ship's programs from the protected archives in
the main core. <br>

down the shields, and we're hanging nose to nose with a Romulan battle
