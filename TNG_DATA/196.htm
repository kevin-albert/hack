PICARD: Yes, indeed. <br>
LWAXANA: Oh, serious. You're always so serious. <br>
PICARD: Lwaxana, as a matter of fact, I am rather busy at the moment. <br>
LWAXANA: And you're always busy with something or other. Never the
right thing, though. My daughter tells me that we're picking up someone
interesting here. <br>
PICARD: Yes, the leading scientist of Kaelon Two and <br>
LWAXANA: Oh, Kaelon Two? I've never heard of that. <br>
PICARD: Well, Lwaxana, it is something of a rather delicate

This is Lieutenant Commander La Forge. <br>
TIMICIN: I beg your pardon, Captain. This is my first time aboard a
Federation starship. Oh yes, they told me. Shaking hands, a form of

of Rixx, Heir of the Holy Rings of Betazed, and what are you doing for
dinner? <br>

PICARD: Lwaxana, we have quite a bit of work planned. <br>
LWAXANA: The man's never been on board a starship before, Jean-Luc.
Certainly somebody ought to make him comfortable before you get
started. <br>

been no practical method of application until now. <br>

TIMICIN: Well, we'll see. They still have to be proved. But now at
least it's possible. I'd never dared hope for such a perfect match with
our own sun. <br>
PICARD: My only regret is that it took us three years to find a
suitable sun after you had first contacted us. <br>
TIMICIN: We're not used to dealing with other worlds. We're not used to
asking for anything from others. Your offer of help has given us a
possible means of survival. It has taken forty years of my life to
develop the programming that will control your photon torpedoes. It has
been my life. Thank you for this opportunity. My only wish has been to
find a way to revive our sun before I die.

go down there, to his loving friends, be wined, dined, honoured for his

Fifteen or twenty centuries ago, we had no Resolution. We had no such
concern for our elders. As people aged, their health failed, they
became invalids. Those whose families could no longer care for them
were put away in deathwatch facilities, where they waited in loneliness
for the end to come, sometimes for years. They had meant something, and
they were forced to live beyond that, into a time of meaning nothing,
of knowing they could now only be the beneficiaries of younger people's
patience. We are no longer that cruel, Lwaxana. <br>
LWAXANA: No, no, you're not cruel to them. You just kill them. <br>
TIMICIN: The Resolution is a celebration of life. It allows us to end
our lives with dignity. <br>
LWAXANA: A celebration of life. It sounds very noble, very caring. What
you're really saying is you got rid of the problem by getting rid of
the people. <br>
TIMICIN: It may sound that way, but it is a time of transition. One
generation passing on the responsibilities of life to the next. <br>
LWAXANA: What about the responsibility of caring of the elderly? <br>
TIMICIN: That would place a dreadful burden on the children. <br>
LWAXANA: We raise them, we care for them, we suffer for them. We keep
them from harm their whole lives. Eventually, it's their turn to take
care of us. <br>
TIMICIN: No parent should expect to be paid back for the love they've
given their children. <br>
LWAXANA: Well why the hell not? (to the replicator) Oskoids. <br>
TIMICIN: What's that? <br>
LWAXANA: (eating) Oskoids. A Betazed delicacy. <br>
TIMICIN: Looks very interesting. <br>
LWAXANA: You should have tried it while you were still alive. No reason
to bother now. Why sixty? Why not sixty two, or fifty eight? <br>
TIMICIN: A reasonable age had to be set. <br>
LWAXANA: But it's not reasonable. Certainly not in your case. You're as
vital and healthy a man as I've ever known. <br>
TIMICIN: That is why I wish to say goodbye to my family and colleagues
while I am this way, in complete command of my faculties, knowing they
will always remember me as a strong and vigorous man. <br>
LWAXANA: But it makes no sense. Some of your people could still be
active at seventy or eighty, and others might be seriously ill at
fifty. How cruel of you to make them wait so long to commit suicide. <br>
TIMICIN: Setting a standard age for the Resolution makes it uniform for
everybody. To ask individual families to decide when their elders are
to die, that would be heartless. <br>
LWAXANA: I agree. Why not let everybody die when they die. <br>
TIMICIN: Lwaxana. <br>
LWAXANA: You have a grandson, you said. <br>
TIMICIN: Yes, almost seven. <br>
LWAXANA: Well, wouldn't it be better for him to know his grandfather?
Not some vague memory of someone who once loved him, but a real living
person who does love him. Don't you really think that would be better? <br>
TIMICIN: I attended the Resolution of my parents when it was their
time. It was beautiful. Lwaxana, this is a custom I've known and
accepted all my life. <br>
LWAXANA: The women of Betazed used to wear these enormous wigs with
large holes in the cenre for tiny caged animals. <br>
TIMICIN: Yes. <br>
LWAXANA: First, it was a fashion. Then it went on long enough to become
a custom, a tradition. But it was uncomfortable for the woman and
cruel to the animal. So then one day, one very formidable woman finally
said so, refused ever to wear another of those wigs. fairly soon the
custom stopped. She had the courage to stand up and fight for change. <br>
TIMICIN: She must have been a lot like you. <br>
LWAXANA: Timicin, there is no one more qualified, more experienced, or
more likely to save their planet than you. And they would have you kill
yourself. <br>
TIMICIN: Younger scientists will take my place. My work, the work will
continue. <br>
LWAXANA: Your planet has what, thirty, forty years left? What if your
scientists can't find the answer without you? What then? What chance do
you think your grandson has of reaching the age of sixty? <br>
TIMICIN: Enough, please. It is my time, Lwaxana, and that is the way it
is. <br>
LWAXANA: If that's the way it is, I don't know why anyone's bothering
to try to save your world at all. If its time has come, let it die.
Where's the difference, Timicin? Where?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TIMICIN: Convection boundary uncoupling. The
reaction caused gas turbulence of a totally unexpected magnitude. Why? <br>
DATA: There was a evidence of a delayed surface shock. <br>
TIMICIN: No, I'd anticipated that. I thought I'd anticipated all
possible variables, but stars, they're like living entities in a way.
Quite unpredictable. You know, I wouldn't be at all surprised if this
were the result of. Look here. Forty two seconds into the test, there
is a sudden rise in the level of hydrogen alpha emissions. And here,
here's another. I'm right, aren't I? There had to be neutron migration
within the star's inner core as the reaction grew. <br>
DATA: Perhaps, Doctor, but there is no known method for controlling a
neutron migration. <br>
TIMICIN: Yes, yes, but theoretically it is possible. Using these test
results, we could construct a new computer model of the energy dynamics
of a star that can test a new detonation programme. I'm certain it can
be accomplished. Certain. It's just a matter of time. A matter of time.

then? <br>
TIMICIN: Captain, I have come to officially request asylum aboard The
Enterprise. <br>
(later) <br>
B'TARDAT [on monitor]: Timicin, I cannot believe this. Why asylum?
Asylum from what? <br>
TIMICIN: I turn sixty in four days, Minister. <br>
B'TARDAT [on monitor]: Yes, and your family and colleagues are already
gathering for your Resolution. <br>
TIMICIN: I believe that it is time for us to re-examine, as a people,
the wisdom of The Resolution. <br>
B'TARDAT [on monitor]: Are they forcing you into this? Are you being
coerced? <br>
TIMICIN: Influenced, perhaps. Coerced, no. <br>
PICARD: Our only influence, Minister, is by example. Timicin's decision
is his own free will, I assure you. <br>
B'TARDAT [on monitor]: I cannot believe that a man of Timicin's stature
would freely choose to reject his own culture. <br>
TIMICIN: No one on Kaelon Two understands this project as I do. There
are new theories that would take others a decade to test and confirm.
With my guidance, it can be done in half that time. I must finish my
work. <br>
B'TARDAT [on monitor]: Others started your work, others will finish it.
It's always been this way. It always will. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Captain, scanners indicate two Kaelon warships rising on an
intercept course. <br>
PICARD: Acknowledged, Commander. Minister, we're here in friendship,
hoping to provide assistance. <br>
B'TARDAT [on monitor]: You have helped quite enough, Captain. I suggest
you return Timicin and depart. If you attempt to leave orbit with
Timicin on board, our ships have been ordered to open fire. <br>
TIMICIN: B'tardat, there's no purpose at all in letting this become <br>

TIMICIN: It shouldn't have happened. I've handled this poorly. <br>
PICARD: You acted in good conscience, Doctor. I don't see what else you
could have done. <br>
TIMICIN: I could have let well enough alone. I could have returned
home. What do you think, Captain? Have I done the right thing? <br>
PICARD: I'm afraid you're the only one who can answer that. <br>
TIMICIN: Lwaxana would have me lead a revolt. I'm only a scientist. I
wish I had her strength. She is a woman of extraordinary conviction,
isn't she? <br>
PICARD: Isn't she.

LAFORGE: They've disengaged the link-up, Doctor. <br>

not accept it! Because I do not terminate my

hardly consider that irrelevant. <br>
