the long conflict between the Federation and Cardassia.

Sector twenty one five oh three. <br>
PICARD: Be on the lookout for a Cardassian patrol ship, Mister Worf.
They should be hailing us soon. <br>
RIKER: Even with a treaty, they're still skittish about protecting
their border. <br>
PICARD: Last time I was in this sector, I was on the Stargazer, running
at warp speed ahead of a Cardassian warship. <br>
TROI: Running, Captain? You? That's hard to believe. <br>
PICARD: Believe it. I'd been sent to make preliminary overtures to a
truce. I'd lowered my shields as a gesture of good will. But the
Cardassians were not impressed. They had taken out most of my weapons
and damaged the impulse engines before I could regroup and run. <br>
WORF: The Cardassians have no honour. I do not trust them. <br>
TROI: They're our allies now, Mister Worf. We have to trust them. <br>
WORF: Trust is earned, not given away. <br>
PICARD: I hope their scout ship makes contact soon. It's not a good
idea to stay too long on a Cardassian border without making your
intentions known.

Enterprise. <br>

PICARD: Why have you fired on us? <br>
MACET [on viewscreen]: A curious question, Captain. In war, one attacks
one's enemies. <br>
PICARD: There is a treaty between our peoples. <br>
MACET [on viewscreen]: Perhaps that fact was unknown to the Federation
starship which destroyed our space station in the Cuellar System two
days ago. <br>
PICARD: A Federation starship? <br>
MACET [on viewscreen]: Attacked an unarmed science station. They had
barely enough time to send an emergency signal before they were
incinerated. <br>
PICARD: Gul Macet the Federation and the Cardassians have struggled too
hard for peace to abandon it so easily. <br>
MACET [on viewscreen]: We are not the ones who abandoned it, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Let me talk to my superiors, find out what's behind this. Give
me one hour. The alternative is for us to continue firing at one other,
and in such a contest, you would be at a disadvantage. <br>
MACET [on viewscreen]: Very well. One hour. <br>

must have had provocation. <br>
HADEN [on monitor]: I wish we knew. He's gone on silent running.
Doesn't answer our

HADEN [on monitor]: The station he destroyed was in sector twenty one

find him. <br>
PICARD: Will the Cardassians cooperate? <br>
HADEN [on monitor]: They've granted you safe passage. We've agreed that
you'll take along a delegation of observers as a show of good faith.
Jean-Luc, I don't have to tell you the Federation is not prepared for a
new sustained conflict. You must preserve the peace, no matter what the

PICARD: They're our guests, Mister Worf. I don't want them to feel like

RIKER: I tend to agree with Mister Worf, Captain. I think we should
limit their access while they're on board. They don't need to have the

RIKER: In fact, we have no idea where it is. We thought the last known

MACET: Captain Picard, you can understand that we are sceptical. Do you
expect us to believe that you are using every means at your disposal to
track down one of your own? <br>
PICARD: Of course you are concerned, Gul Macet. It is precisely because
of that fact that I have included you in every aspect of our effort.
You're present with my staff. You're hearing reports as I hear them,
nothing edited, nothing withheld. <br>
MACET: Very well. <br>
PICARD: Transporter Chief O'Brien, has served with Benjamin Maxwell. I
thought that he might be able to provide some insights.
Mister O'Brien, I understand that Captain Maxwell lost his family
during a raid on an outpost. <br>
O'BRIEN: More like sabotage, sir. It was on Setlik Three. A squad of
Cardassian militia made a sneak raid on an outpost, wiped out close to
a hundred civilians. <br>
MACET: Then it's revenge he's after. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's not what I meant. <br>

you will give us more precise coordinates and the ship's coded
transponder frequency, we would be able to intercept Maxwell far more
quickly than you. <br>

prefer to make the initial contact myself. I'm sure you would, if the
situation were reversed. <br>
MACET: Captain, time is crucial. You have a dangerous man out there
with a huge arsenal at his command. If he is intent on revenge against
my people he must be stopped before he can do more damage. <br>
PICARD: Captain, so far we have an isolated incident. If I can reach
him first, then perhaps diplomacy can prevail.
But if one of your ships decides to retaliate, there is a danger we
could lose control of the situation. <br>

Maxwell always liked that song. I guess it's all this business with him

still don't like the Cardassians. <br>

phaser was set at maximum. The man just incinerated, there before my

so-called science station? Military supply port. <br>
PICARD: How do you know this? <br>
MAXWELL: Information comes my way. <br>
PICARD: From whom? Where is your documentation? <br>
MAXWELL: I know what they're doing. I can smell it. There's no good
reason for a science station in the Cuellar System, but it's a hell of
a strategic site for a military transport station. A jumping-off point
into three Federation sectors. They're
running supply ships back and forth and nobody's going to tell me it's
for scientific research. <br>
PICARD: But whatever circumstances you encountered, why didn't you
notify Starfleet? <br>
MAXWELL: And wait six months while the bureaucrats sit around reading
reports, trying to figure out what to do? They don't know what's going
on out here. But you should, Picard. You know what it's like to be
under fire. <br>
PICARD: You weren't under fire. <br>
MAXWELL: Lives were at stake. <br>
PICARD: Whose lives? <br>
MAXWELL: We had to act now. <br>
PICARD: Why? <br>
MAXWELL: It smells musty in here. Like a bureaucrat's office. <br>
PICARD: You have killed nearly seven hundred people and you have taken
us to the brink of war. <br>
MAXWELL: I have prevented war, or at the very least delayed it a good
long time. The peace treaty was a ruse, to give them breathing room,
time to regroup. <br>
PICARD: And so all alone you decided to dispose of the treaty. <br>
MAXWELL: I took the initiative. I did what had to be done. <br>
PICARD: What had to be done? For whom? Why does a man with a long and
brilliant service abandon the fundamental principles that he has
believed in, even fought for, all his life? I believe it is because of
what they did to your wife and your children. <br>
MAXWELL: Not true. Not true. <br>
PICARD: To avenge their deaths. <br>
MAXWELL: You're a fool, Picard. History will look at you and say this
man was a fool. <br>
PICARD: I'll accept the judgement of history. <br>
MAXWELL: When it becomes clear what the Cardassians have done, I will
be vindicated. <br>
PICARD: What the Cardassians have or have not done is irrelevant. <br>
MAXWELL: Irrelevant? Come with me. Find one of their supply ships and
we'll see how irrelevant it is. <br>
PICARD: We're not going after any more Cardassian ships. You're going
to return to your bridge and set a course for Starbase two one one. The
Phoenix and the Enterprise will return to Federation space together.
Those are Starfleet's orders. I will permit you
the dignity of retaining your command during the voyage. The only
alternative is to put you in the brig and to tow your ship back to
starbase in disgrace. <br>
MAXWELL: I will return to my ship. <br>
PICARD: You understand your orders? <br>
MAXWELL: Yes, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, report to my Ready room. My guest is departing. <br>
WORF [OC]: Aye, sir.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, supplemental. With the Phoenix in
close formation, we are proceeding directly to Starbase two one one.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Mister Data, how long until we clear
Cardassian space? <br>
DATA: At our present speed, three hours, twenty minutes, sir. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, send a message to Admiral Haden at Starfleet.
Inform him of our projected time of arrival. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
DATA: Captain, the Phoenix has changed course. <br>
MACET: What is he doing? <br>
PICARD: Ensign, change course to pursue. Mister Worf, will you hail
Captain Maxwell? <br>
WORF: No response, sir. <br>
RIKER: Data, project his new course. <br>
DATA: Sir, the Phoenix is heading directly for a Cardassian vessel
point one two light years from our location. <br>
MACET: He'll attack that ship just as he did the others. <br>
PICARD: Continue the hail, Mister Worf. Priority one message. Do you
know what that ship might be? <br>
MACET: I imagine it's a supply ship, headed for the research station in
the Kelrabi system. <br>
WORF: The Phoenix still does not respond, sir. <br>
PICARD: Ensign, warp eight. Overtake him. <br>
DATA: Captain, the Phoenix has accelerated to warp nine. We will not be
able to reach him before he intercepts the Cardassian ship. <br>
PICARD: Ensign, warp nine. <br>
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, arm phasers. Continue the hail. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
RIKER: Captain, Chief O'Brien was Maxwell's Tactical officer. <br>
PICARD: Get him up here. <br>
(a short time later, O'Brien enters) <br>
DATA: Sir, the Phoenix has dropped out of warp. They have reached the
Cardassian vessel. <br>
RIKER: Slow to impulse. <br>
WORF: Vessels are within visual range. <br>
PICARD: On screen. <br>
RIKER: Has the Phoenix activated its weapon systems? <br>
DATA: Negative, sir. Their phaser banks are not armed. <br>
RIKER: What about the Cardassians? <br>
DATA: Our sensors are unable to determine status of the Cardassian
defensive systems. Their ship is running with a high powered subspace
field. <br>
PICARD: Mister O'Brien, your former Commander, a Federation Captain, is
about to place me in the position of firing on his ship. I need your
knowledge of the man. How he thinks, what he's capable of doing. <br>
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. <br>
WORF: Sir, Captain Maxwell is hailing us. <br>
PICARD: On screen. <br>
MAXWELL [on viewscreen]: All right, Picard. You need proof? You've got
it now. <br>
PICARD: Captain Maxwell, you have disobeyed a direct order. <br>
MAXWELL [on viewscreen]: Board the ship, you'll see that everything
I've been saying is true. <br>
PICARD: The Cardassian vessel will not be boarded. You will transport
yourself aboard the Enterprise <br>
MAXWELL [on viewscreen]: Picard, if you don't board that ship, I'll
destroy it. <br>
PICARD: And I will use whatever force is necessary to prevent you from
taking that action, Captain. <br>
(transmission ends) <br>
O'BRIEN: Sir, Captain Maxwell, if he feels his back is to the wall,
he'll strike. <br>
DATA: Captain, the Phoenix is transferring power to its shields. <br>
WORF: They're arming phasers and loading forward torpedo bays. <br>
PICARD: Red alert. It seems you were right, Mister O'Brien. Ready
phasers, load torpedoes. <br>
WORF: Phasers armed. Loading forward and aft torpedo bays. <br>
O'BRIEN: Sir, let me beam over. Try to talk to him. We served together
a long time. When you've been through what we have, you tend to get
inside someone. He might listen. <br>
RIKER: He'd never drop his shields and allow you to transport on board.
<br>
O'BRIEN: The Phoenix is using a high energy sensor system. It cycles
every five point five minutes. Between cycles there's a window of a
fiftieth of a second. Trust me, I can get through. <br>
PICARD: Make it so.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MAXWELL: Not now! <br>
(O'Brien enters and Maxwell grabs a phaser) <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm not armed. <br>
MAXWELL: How the devil did you get over here? <br>
O'BRIEN: I had the thought that if we could talk we could figure a way
out of this mess. <br>
MAXWELL: The way out of this is clear. Talk to Picard. Get him to board
the damned ship. <br>
O'BRIEN: He won't do that, sir. <br>
MAXWELL: But he'd turn his weapons on a Federation Starship to protect
the enemy? I don't believe it. <br>
O'BRIEN: He will. Count on it. <br>
MAXWELL: What the hell has happened to this war? <br>
O'BRIEN: Sir, there is no war. The war is over. <br>
MAXWELL: You're wrong. The Cardassians live to make war. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's what everybody thinks about the enemy. That's probably
what they think about us. <br>
MAXWELL: We're not the same at all. We do not start wars. We do not
make surprise attacks on manned outposts. We do not butcher women and
children in their homes. Children who never got the chance to grow up.
You were with me on Setlick. You saw what they did. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. <br>
MAXWELL: What was the name of the fellow who always hung around you
like a puppy? <br>
O'BRIEN: Will Kayden. Stompie. <br>
MAXWELL: Stompie. As cool under fire as a mountain lake. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. <br>
MAXWELL: He died at Setlick, didn't he? <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. <br>
MAXWELL: What was that song of his? The one he always sang, the one I
liked? <br>
O'BRIEN: (sings) The minstrel boy to the war has gone. In the ranks of
death you will find him. <br>
BOTH: His father's sword he hath girded on and his wild harp slung
behind him. Land of song, said the warrior bard, tho' all the world
betrays thee. One sword at least thy rights shall guard. <br>
O'BRIEN: One faithful harp shall praise thee. <br>
MAXWELL: I'm not going to win this one, am I. Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, sir. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, supplemental. Captain Maxwell has
turned his ship over to his First Officer and transported aboard the
Enterprise. I have confined him to quarters for the return voyage.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Observation lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Thank you, Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'd just like to say, sir, he was a good man. What he did was
terribly wrong, I know that now, but I'm still proud to have served
with him. <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Chief, and well done. That'll be all. <br>
(O'Brien leaves) <br>
MACET: His loyalty is admirable, even if it is misplaced. <br>
PICARD: The loyalty you would so quickly dismiss does not come easily
to my people, Gul Macet. You have much to learn about us. Benjamin
Maxwell earned the loyalty of those who served with him. You know, in
war, he was twice honoured with the Federation's highest citation for
courage and valour. And if he could not find a role for himself in
peace, we can pity him, but we shall not dismiss him. <br>
MACET: You are welcome to your opinion, Captain. I, for one, am
grateful he is under lock and key. <br>
PICARD: One more thing, Macet. Maxwell was right. Those ships were not
carrying scientific equipment, were they? A research station within
arm's reach of three Federation sectors? Cargo ships running with high
energy subspace fields that jam sensors? <br>
MACET: If you believed the transport ship was carrying weapons,
Captain, why didn't you board it as Maxwell requested? <br>
PICARD: I was here to protect the peace. A peace that I firmly believe
is in the interests of both our peoples. If I had attempted to board
that ship I am quite certain that you and I would not be having this
pleasant conversation, and that ships on both sides would now be arming
for war. <br>
MACET: Captain, I assure you. <br>
PICARD: Take this message to your leaders, Gul Macet. We'll be
watching. </font> </p>
