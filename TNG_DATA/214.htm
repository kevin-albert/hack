DATA: The characteristic response to the Kriskov Gambit is to counter
with the el-Mitra Exchange, particularly since I have already taken
both your rooks. By missing that opportunity, you have left your king
vulnerable. <br>
TROI: We'll see. <br>
DATA: As you wish, Counsellor. Check. <br>
(Troi makes her move) <br>
DATA: Intriguing. You have devised a completely unanticipated response
to a classic attack. You will checkmate my king in seven moves. <br>
TROI: Data, chess isn't just a game of ploys and gambits. It's a game
of intuition. <br>
DATA: You are a challenging opponent, Counsellor. <br>
TROI: Thanks, but don't think a compliment's going to get you out of
our bet. You owe me one Samarian Sunset made in the traditional style,
as only you can make it, Data. <br>

CRUSHER: If I remember correctly, the last time you graced my Sickbay,
you were diving off the Cliffs of Heaven on Sumiko Four. Holodeck

KRISTIN: Same thing. Only that time, I flattened out when I should have
tucked. <br>

RIKER: This console has tactical configuration? <br>
WORF: Yes. Phaser power status, intruder scan, torpedo guidance. But
they do not appear to be operable. <br>
PICARD: Clearly, we still possess certain skills. It would seem we know
how to operate this ship. But our identities have somehow been erased
or suppressed. <br>
RIKER: We are on the Bridge. There's a good chance this is our ship.
Looks like you're the leader. <br>
WORF: Perhaps we should not jump to conclusions. I am decorated as
well. <br>
PICARD: It seems to me that determining leadership is not crucial right
now. We need to find out who we are and well, what we're doing out
here. <br>
MACDUFF: But how did this happen? What did this to us? <br>
LAFORGE: Better still, who did this to us? I've got some intermittent
sensor readings here. The scan keeps repeating itself like it's stuck,
but it looks like there's metallic debris right in front of us.

LAFORGE: That's a good possibility. <br>
WORF: Perhaps we were engaged in battle. <br>
MACDUFF: If they stunned us with some type of bioelectric field that
could have wiped out our memories. <br>

sustained other damage. Um, Computer, status report. <br>
RIKER: No voice interface. <br>
LAFORGE: No interface, period. Hey. Got something. I've accessed the
basic system directories. <br>
PICARD: Can we get a general status report? <br>
LAFORGE: Life support systems throughout the ship are fully
operational. Navigation, propulsion offline. <br>
RO: What about communications? <br>
LAFORGE: Completely disrupted. <br>
RO: That rules out a distress signal. <br>
RIKER: If we even knew where to send it. <br>

LAFORGE: We do now. <br>
PICARD: Lets use it. This ship must have a crew. They may still have
their memories. <br>

have. <br>

the tactical arrays, defensive and offensive. <br>
LAFORGE: Everything looks functional. Now, if we could just access the
control systems, we could get them up and running. <br>
RIKER: According to the schematics, the engineering computer core
access is down that corridor. <br>
RO: Weapons, propulsion and shields are the priorities. We could be in
danger of another attack. <br>

WORF: Engineering is working on accessing the control systems. As soon
as the ship is operational, we must make it combat ready. <br>

try to access the ship's logs, find out who we are, what our purpose
here might be. <br>

damage to the hippocampus. That suggests that we still have our
long-term memories but somehow they're being blocked. <br>
PICARD: Is it possible to bypass the normal pathways? To get at those
memories some other way? <br>

brain scans for comparison. Is there any chance I can get the crew's

DATA: This vessel is called the Enterprise. We are part of an
organization called the United Federation of Planets. The
Federation is currently in a state of war. <br>
TROI: With whom? <br>
LAFORGE: The Lysian Alliance. They're a genocidal race determined to
destroy us. The war has been going on for years. <br>
DATA: Starfleet Command believes the Lysians are using a new weapon
which has shifted the balance of power to their favour. <br>
LAFORGE: Over the last two months, fourteen Federation ships have been
captured, apparently very easily, their crews held captive on Lysia. <br>
PICARD: What do we know about this weapon? <br>
DATA: Our scientists theorise the Lysians are using an energy wave,
either plasma-based or a subspace interference pattern. The weapon
severely disrupts a starship's computer system as well as the mental
functions of its crew. <br>

We've been ordered to cross into Lysian territory and destroy their
Central
Command. This is it. The nerve centre for the entire Lysian military
operation. <br>
TROI: Captain, there's been a great deal of damage to our computer
system. Maybe we're not getting the correct information. <br>

PICARD: Open a channel. <br>
MACDUFF: No! Their new weapon. Whatever it was that erased out our
computers and our memories, maybe this is how they do it, over
communication channels. <br>
DATA: It is conceivable, sir. <br>
TROI: It's also possible that they just want to talk to us. I think we
should respond. <br>
WORF: Captain, the ship is hailing us again. <br>
MACDUFF: If you're wrong, it could mean our destruction. We can't take
the risk, Captain. <br>
DATA: The Lysians have stopped transmitting, Captain. They are powering
up their disruptors. They have locked onto us, sir. <br>
RIKER: Full shields. <br>

received any transmission from the destroyer by now. <br>
MACDUFF: They're going to be on alert. <br>
RO: I recommend a randomly vectored approach to our target. It would be
our best chance of avoiding sort of any pursuit. <br>
PICARD: Agreed. Doctor, the success of this mission would be far more
likely if we could get our memories back. Is there anything you can do?
<br>
CRUSHER: I found several cases resembling our condition in the medical
index. The causes are different, but the cure is similar in each case. <br>
RIKER: Could the same treatment work for us? <br>
CRUSHER: That's my hope. It involves increasing the activity of the
medial temporal region of the brain, using short-term memory synapses
to retrieve long-term memory. <br>
PICARD: When can you start? <br>
CRUSHER: As soon as our medical files become available. It would be
dangerous to attempt treatment without them. <br>
PICARD: Mister La Forge? <br>
LAFORGE: Data and I ran into some trouble accessing the medical file
areas in the computer, but with a little time I'm pretty sure we'll be
able to get there. Three hours, maximum. <br>

LAFORGE: You must have been one hell of a bartender. It's too bad there
aren't any more of you around. We could certainly use the help. <br>

LAFORGE: I wonder why you're the only one on board? <br>
DATA: I have expended considerable thought with respect to my apparent
uniqueness among the crew. <br>
LAFORGE: Any conclusions? <br>
DATA: Several possibilities suggest themselves. I may represent an
entire race of artificial lifeforms. If so, there may be a home planet
for others of my kind. A shared history and a culture of which I am not
presently aware. <br>
LAFORGE: Then again, you could've been built just for this ship. <br>
DATA: I have considered that possibility as well. It may also be the
case that every starship in the Federation is equipped with an
artificial lifeform such as myself. <br>
LAFORGE: If that's true, maybe you all look alike. A standard issue
android. Hard to construct so only one allowed per vessel. <br>
DATA: There is another possibility. Perhaps my origin is unique. In
that case, I am alone. We have accessed the information storage area.
Considerable damage has been done to the files themselves. <br>
LAFORGE: The mission reports are gone. <br>
DATA: As well as the crew records, and the personal logs. <br>
LAFORGE: So are the medical records.

TROI: Everything. Every time I think about this war, our mission, I
feel a sense of panic like a hand's closing around my throat. <br>
RIKER: You're never going to feel good about this war. None of us will.
But we've got to complete our mission. I've been doing a little
research, trying to find out about William T Riker. <br>
TROI: What have you discovered? <br>
RIKER: He's a musician, for one thing. <br>
(plays a little on the trombone) <br>
TROI: Very impressive. <br>
RIKER: No one was more surprised than I. <br>
TROI: So what else has your research uncovered about William Riker? <br>
RIKER: He's athletically inclined, loves to climb mountain. He's from
somewhere called Alaska. He enjoys exotic food, and takes his vacations
on a planet called Risa. <br>

this damage is. Any records of a personal nature, any files that could
tell us about who we are, those are the ones that are gone. <br>
RIKER: It's a little too selective to be coincidence. <br>
CRUSHER: As selective as what was done to our own memories. Skills
still in place but personal knowledge is unavailable. <br>
MACDUFF: It is consistent with what we know about the new Lysian
weapon. <br>
PICARD: Doctor, is it absolutely necessary to see the medical files to
attempt treatment? <br>
CRUSHER: It would be dangerous to do it without them. <br>
RIKER: It's a risk I think we have to take. <br>

There should be some increase. Let's try broadening the bandwidth. Go
to thirty point one. Raise the frequency as well. Increase by thirty
three percent. <br>

initiator. We're lucky we didn't lose you. Did any of this work? Do you
remember anything more about yourself? <br>

MACDUFF: You wanted to see me, Captain? <br>
PICARD: Yes, Commander. Please, come in. Sit down. I find myself having
grave concerns about our mission. <br>
MACDUFF: Concerns as to its success? <br>
PICARD: No, no, no. More fundamental doubts. Whether or not it can be
justified. <br>
MACDUFF: I've been asking myself the same thing. I'm sure our superiors
feel their orders are justified. <br>
PICARD: Orders which we can't even verify. <br>
MACDUFF: Orders we can't ignore. <br>
PICARD: But I also can't ignore that we have greatly outclassed the
only enemy vessel we've encountered. And that every
single possible shred of information which might shed some light on
this situation has been conveniently eliminated. I feel as though I've
been handed a weapon, sent into a room and told to shoot a stranger.
Well, I need some moral context to justify that action, and I don't
have it. I'm not content simply to obey orders. I need to know that
what I am doing is right. <br>
MACDUFF: So do I. I'd feel a lot better about this if all the questions
were answered. And if you want to abandon our mission until our
memories return, that's your choice, but I must ask you. Is it right to
risk prolonging this war, to allow the needless deaths of thousands on
both sides, solely on the basis of our moral discomfort?

I were born for battle. More so than the others. <br>
WORF: I thought this as well. <br>
MACDUFF: It's conceivable that is the very reason that we've been
assigned to this vessel. The Enterprise has science officers, medical
specialists, engineers. Our Captain is undoubtedly an accomplished
diplomat. But we, we are the warriors. There are times for diplomacy.
This is not one of them. <br>
WORF: You're concerned about the Captain? <br>
MACDUFF: I am concerned about completing our mission, ending this war.
In victory. We may soon face a critical moment. The success of our
mission may hang on a split-second decision. A hesitation would kill us
all, and those that are counting on us will surely die as well. We

PICARD: I do not fire on defenceless people. Mister Worf open a channel
to the Lysians. <br>
MACDUFF: Belay that order! There's something wrong with the Captain.
I'm taking command of this vessel. Fire all weapons! Mister Worf. <br>
(Worf blocks his way, and gets thrown across the Bridge far too easily.

recovers to try and fire the ships weapons. Riker shoots again, and
