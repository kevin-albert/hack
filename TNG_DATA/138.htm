Captain's log, stardate 42625.4, We're entering orbit around the eighth
planet in this previously unmapped Theta One Sixteen solar system. We
diverted from our scheduled course when a passing Klingon cruiser
reported discovering pieces of a strange vessel in the upper atmosphere
of this planet. We have come to investigate.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: Nasty. Nitrogen, methane, liquid neon.
Surface temperature minus two hundred and ninety one degrees Celsius.
Winds up to three hundred and twelve metres per second. <br>
RIKER: Not exactly a vacation planet, eh? <br>
LAFORGE: Not unless you like ammonia tornadoes. But I have found
indications of debris in an elliptical orbit. <br>
RIKER: Keep me informed. The sooner we find out what the Klingons think
they saw, the sooner we can get the hell out of here. <br>
LAFORGE: Sounds good to me. Nasty.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Come. <br>
(Riker enters) <br>
PICARD: Fermat's last theorem. You're familiar with it? <br>
RIKER: Vaguely. I spent too many math classes daydreaming about being
on a starship. <br>
PICARD: When Pierre de Fermat died they found this equation scrawled in
the margin of his notes. X to the nth plus Y to the nth equals Z to the
nth, where n is greater than 2, which he said had no solution in whole
numbers. But he also added this phrase.
Remarkable proof. <br>
RIKER: Yeah, that's starting to come back to me. There was no proof
included. <br>
PICARD: For the eight hundred years people have been trying to solve
it. <br>
RIKER: Including you. <br>
PICARD: I find it stimulating. Also, it puts things in perspective. In
our arrogance we feel we are so advanced, and yet we cannot unravel a
simple knot tied by a part-time French mathematician working alone,
without a computer. <br>
RIKER: Captain, we've detected some sort of debris in a loose orbit. <br>
PICARD: Can you identify it? <br>
RIKER: No, sir. I suggest we beam a section aboard for analysis. <br>
PICARD: Make it so, Number One.

it. <br>
PICARD: What sort of markings? <br>
RIKER: Uncertain. Energise. <br>
(O'Brien beams a piece of curved metal construction aboard. He and
Riker go to the pad and turn it's outer surface to face us. Lo and
behold, a US flag and the letters NASA. The camera drools over it
lovingly. Why couldn't it be ESA for once?) <br>
PICARD: We've got ourselves a puzzle, Number One. <br>
RIKER: Yes sir. I think we have. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Observation lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Analysis bears out that the object was
definitely terrestrial in origin, dated mid twenty first century. <br>
PICARD: No, no. No Earth ship of that time could have travelled out
this far. <br>
DATA: Nevertheless, that is what our tests indicate. And the markings
we discovered are consistent with this hypothesis. <br>
TROI: Any indication of what destroyed it, Data? <br>
DATA: That is even more significant than the object itself, Counsellor.
On several of its surfaces, the molecules seem to have disintegrated <br>
RIKER: Disintegrated? How? <br>
DATA: Almost as if they were hit by a weapon from our time. <br>
PICARD: Curiouser and curiouser. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WESLEY: It's a building of some sort, situated on a
plain of frozen methane, smack in the middle of a tremendous storm
belt. <br>
RIKER: I don't believe this. That structure is surrounded by breathable
air. <br>
PICARD: Is there any connection between that structure and the ship
fragment we found? <br>
LAFORGE: Unknown, sir. <br>
PICARD: Suggestions? <br>
RIKER: Just one, sir. We could go down there and have a look. <br>
PICARD: Breathable air. No life forms that might be dangerous. I think
we could risk a minimal away team, Number One. </font></p>

D. <br>

PICARD [OC]: Can you read it? <br>
RIKER: Yes. I write this in the hope that it will someday be read by

exploratory shuttle was contaminated by an alien life form which
infected and killed all personnel except myself. </font></p>

they thought this was the world from which I came. </font></p>
