Captain's log, Stardate 42402.7. We are travelling in the Omega Sagitta
system traversing between twin planets that form the Coalition of
Madena. Both worlds is populated by a humanoid race which colonised the
planets two centuries ago, and which now co-exist under a precarious
but successful treaty.

DATA: Sensor readings show it to be a small class-nine vessel, probably
an interplanetary cargo ship. <br>
WORF: One life sign aboard, sir. It appears to be humanoid. <br>
DATA: I have its call sign now, sir. <br>
WORF: Confirmed. Armed with lasers only. <br>
DATA: Its cargo holds are empty. The readout shows its guidance system
is malfunctioning. The pilot is attempting to hold course manually. <br>
RIKER: I recommend we set the Enterprise on an intercept course in case
he needs emergency assistance. <br>
PICARD: Make it so, Mister Crusher. <br>
(The little ship comes up astern of the majestic vessel) <br>
RIKER: We're in position now, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <br>
WORF: Hailing frequencies open. <br>
PICARD: On viewer. This is the USS Enterprise. Captain Jean Luc Picard.
<br>
OKONA [on viewscreen]: (bending over, bottom towards us) And this is
the cargo carrier Erstwhile. Captain Okona at your service, sir.
There's no need for your phasers, Captain. I'm harmless and not quite
yet ready for mercy killing. <br>
PICARD: You were never considered a danger to us, Captain. <br>
OKONA [on viewscreen]: Oh, that's a shame. I can remember when I was at
least considered a risk. <br>
(Okona is a handsome, long-haired pirate of a man, and he sits down to
face us) <br>
OKONA [on viewscreen]: I'm the owner and operator of this craft and
since we both know that you've already scanned it, you know I'm alone
and empty, which is truly a rare occasion for a man of my charm and
talent. <br>
PICARD: Mute main viewer. Counsellor? <br>
TROI: His emotions suggest that he's mischievous, irreverent and
somewhat brazen. The word that seems to best describe him is rogue. <br>
DATA: Rogue? Ah. Cad, knave, rake, rascal, villain, wild element. <br>
TROI: Yes, Data, but there is no malevolence or ill will. <br>
PICARD: Audio on. You have a burn-out in your guidance system, Captain.
<br>
OKONA: Whoa. Since you're able to diagnose my problems, how about
helping me fix them? <br>
WESLEY: Captain, we could easily repair the type of system he uses. <br>
PICARD: We can accommodate you, Captain. <br>
RIKER: This is the First Officer, sir. If you prepare to shut down your
engines, we can lock on the tractor and beam you over here. <br>
WORF: Sir, recommend limited access to our ship. <br>
PICARD: Agreed. <br>
RIKER: Data, lock on the tractor beam. Transporter Chief, prepare to
him beam aboard. <br>
ROBINSON [OC]: Ready on your command, sir. <br>
OKONA [on viewscreen]: Excuse me, Commander. Is that a woman's voice I
hear? <br>
PICARD: Yes. Now please follow Commander Riker's instructions so our
ship can get back to its normal routine. <br>
OKONA [on viewscreen]: Whatever you say, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Something funny? <br>
RIKER: Well, the unexpected is our normal routine. Hold it steady,
Wesley. Ready to link up on my command <br>
WESLEY: Aye, sir. <br>
RIKER: Easy. Easy. Engage. Captain Okona, shut down your engines. <br>
OKONA [OC]: Understood. <br>
RIKER: Transporter room, prepare for the beaming operation. We're on
our way. Wesley, Data, let's go. </font></p>

OKONA: A Klingon Security officer. <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
OKONA: No wars available, eh? <br>
(He hands over his gun belt, and Worf holds his hand out for the rest.
The knife is down the back of Okona's thigh boots) <br>
OKONA: It's more of a piece of jewellry than a weapon. A remembrance. <br>
RIKER: Welcome aboard, Captain Okona. I'm Commander Riker. If you'll
turn over the inoperative part to Commander Data, we can begin repairs.
<br>
OKONA: I'd be most happy to do the work myself, Commander. I'm sort of
the hands-on type. <br>
RIKER: I think you'd find the tools we use rather unusual, sir. <br>
OKONA: I can believe that. May I at least watch? <br>
RIKER: That can be arranged. <br>
OKONA: Good then. Commander, I leave this in your capable hands. <br>
(And gives the module to Wesley) <br>
WESLEY: Sir, this is Commander Data. I'm just an acting ensign. <br>
OKONA: Well, acting ensigns have names, don't they? <br>
WESLEY: Wesley. Wesley Crusher. <br>
OKONA: Nice to meet you Acting Ensign Wesley Wesley Crusher. (to
Robinson) And thank you for beaming me here and enabling me to see a
truly beautiful woman. You have the majestic carriage and loveliness
that could surely be traced back to the noblest of families. <br>
ROBINSON: Well, I'm sure that you've said that to many ladies before,
and it was no more true then than it is now. <br>
OKONA: But it's how I say it that's really important. The warmth, the
attraction that I have for you. The attraction that we share. <br>
RIKER: Mister Okona seems to have excellent vision as well as a healthy
libido. <br>
ROBINSON: (quietly) It's eight oh six. <br>

right away. </font></p>

LAFORGE: Sure will, and better. Let me show you. On your old one, the

replace them with tricellite. <br>
OKONA: Tricellite isn't available in this system. If I ever had to
replace it. <br>
LAFORGE: Don't worry, you won't. Your ship will never outlast this
part. <br>
OKONA: Because of the part or the way I fly my ship? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, this part, but the stress test did show that you tend to
push your ship a little beyond its design capabilities. <br>
OKONA: Blame the pattern of my life, Lieutenant La Forge. Because it
relegates me to cargo carrying rather than the grand explorations you
enjoy, I'm forced to add a measure of flamboyancy and a zest to the
doldrum of my existence. </font></p>

OKONA: They're both the same. <br>

OKONA: Maybe. Life is like loading twice your cargo weight onto your
spacecraft. If it's canaries and you can keep half of them flying all
the time, you're all right. <br>

OKONA: Accurate? That was a joke I just told you. <br>
DATA: I do not understand. <br>
OKONA: You don't know what a joke is? <br>

child. <br>
OKONA: You know, Captain, your Counsellor's right. He will fight. <br>
WORF: The captain of the other ship is demanding to be heard. <br>
PICARD: I don't suppose you can give me any indication why this man
wants you? <br>
(Okona sighs and shakes his head) <br>
PICARD: Let's put all this together. Lieutenant Worf, multiple image,
full conference mode. Let them all see each other. <br>
WORF: Yes, sir. <br>
KUSHELL [on viewscreen]: Here you are, Debin, trying to save this
criminal. <br>
DEBIN [on viewscreen]: My purpose is not your concern. <br>
KUSHELL [on viewscreen]: It is if it involves Okona. <br>
PICARD: Gentlemen, please, let's try and resolve this matter. Captain
Kushell, what crime has Okona allegedly committed against you? <br>
KUSHELL [on viewscreen]: He is a thief. He stole the Jewel of Thesia. A
national heritage. <br>
DEBIN [on viewscreen]: A thing. An item. My case involves the
victimisation of my daughter, and my honour. I'll have Okona now. <br>
KUSHELL [on viewscreen]: He is mine. <br>
OKONA: One at a time. Who accuses me of stealing? <br>
KUSHELL [on viewscreen]: I do. My son Benzan and I. <br>
BENZAN [on viewscreen]: Father, please. <br>
KUSHELL [on viewscreen]: He used you to become my friend. <br>
DEBIN [on viewscreen]: He used my daughter. <br>
KUSHELL [on viewscreen]: He used my son to plunder a national treasure.
<br>
WORF: Mute. <br>
PICARD: Terminate communications. Come with me.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OKONA: Captain, you can't be afraid of those two or
what they can do to your ship. <br>
PICARD: No, they could fire until their lasers ran dry and they
wouldn't hurt the Enterprise. My predicament is what to do with you.
OKONA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry my ship broke down. I'm sorry you stopped
to help. I'm sorry you're involved. But you're right. Whatever happens,
however it goes, someone gets hurt. Hand me over to Kushell, and Debin
goes to war. <br>
PICARD: And if I hand you over to Debin, then it's the same thing. <br>
OKONA: I wish I could. I wish I could make it easier. <br>
PICARD: I'm sure you do. <br>
OKONA: I'm not going to apologise for the way I am or how I live my
life, but just for the record, I did not steal the Jewel of Thesia. I
am not a criminal, Captain. And as to the other business, that's
between me and Yanar, no one else. <br>
PICARD: In truth, I simply do not have authority in this matter. I'm
not your judge, nor is it my duty to arbitrate. But you are in my
custody, and that creates the dilemma. <br>
OKONA: How about this? Do what you said. Fix my guidance system and let
me leave. <br>
PICARD: According to Starfleet regulations, that would be my only
course of action. But their ships are faster than yours. I'm not doing
you a favour. <br>
OKONA: Captain, with all due respect, that's not your concern. Besides,
I can take care of myself. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OKONA: You're quite a craftsman, Lieutenant La
Forge. How soon? <br>
LAFORGE: What's the rush? I thought you liked it here. <br>
OKONA: I did. It stopped liking me. Time to disappear. <br>
WESLEY: Where will you go? <br>
OKONA: What? <br>
WESLEY: I said, where will you go? <br>
OKONA: A new place, if I make it. <br>
WESLEY: Don't you ever stay anywhere? <br>
OKONA: Not for long. <br>
WESLEY: I couldn't be like that. <br>
OKONA: Oh? <br>
WESLEY: I mean, always being alone. Commander Riker says you choose to
live the way you do and you like it. <br>
OKONA: Is that what he says? <br>
WESLEY: Yeah. It would be difficult for me to be leaving all the time.
I'd miss my friends, the people I love. I guess leaving's gotten easy
for you. <br>
OKONA: I seem to have a way of using up a place. <br>
WESLEY: I wasn't talking about a place. <br>
OKONA: I know. I know what you were talking about.&nbsp;<br>
LAFORGE: It's ready. You should be able to install this in roughly five
minutes. <br>
OKONA: Like you said, Geordi, what's the rush? I have some friends
around here. I think it's time to make a stand.

OKONA: Captain, I've decided not to leave. <br>
PICARD: Oh. <br>
OKONA: Don't worry, I'm not staying either. <br>
PICARD: Just what are your plans, Mister Okona? <br>
OKONA: I've decided to surrender myself. <br>
RIKER: To which one? <br>
OKONA: There's really only one option. <br>
PICARD: Viewer on. Gentlemen, communicating like this is very
distracting. I suggest that we beam you up to the Enterprise and we
resolve this face to face. <br>
KUSHELL [on viewscreen]: Excellent. <br>
DEBIN [on viewscreen]: Agreed. <br>
RIKER: Leave your weapons behind. Let's keep this civilised. <br>
PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge. Counsellor Troi, would you
accompany me to deck fourteen conference room. Worf, see to our guests.
<br>
WORF: Aye, sir. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(No big table, just a few comfortable chairs
scattered around) <br>
DEBIN: Okona, you are without shame. <br>
KUSHELL: For once I agree with Debin. You are without shame. I trusted
you. My son treated you like a brother. And then to steal from us. I
want him now. <br>
DEBIN: No, he's coming with me. Captain, my complaint was registered
first. <br>
PICARD: Now please, please, be calm. Lieutenant, thank you. <br>
(Worf leaves) <br>
OKONA: Everyone is talking about me, and no one's talking to me. You
all believe that I stole the jewel, and that it was I who fathered the
child. <br>
DEBIN: You dare call my daughter a liar? <br>
OKONA: And now I'm offered these two choices, and given these two
options, condemnation as a thief or marriage to the beautiful Yanar. I
will take the more pleasant sentence. I will take Yanar as my wife. <br>
BENZAN: No! You can't! <br>
KUSHELL: My son is right. You can't escape that way. <br>
BENZAN: That's not what I mean. <br>
DEBIN: It's not up to you, or to Okona. I've been dishonoured. I will
decide. <br>
YANAR: Wait. Since all of you believe Okona is the father of this
child, then so be it. I'll marry you. <br>
BENZAN: No! You can't. <br>
YANAR: Yes, I can. <br>
KUSHELL: Okona is still a thief. <br>
BENZAN: No, he's not. Nothing has been stolen. The Jewel of Thesia has
been taken into custody by its rightful heir. Me. I was to give it to
Yanar as our pledge of marriage. <br>
KUSHELL: Marriage? <br>
BENZAN: Yanar is carrying my child. <br>
DEBIN: You said it was Okona's. <br>
YANAR: If I'd told you it was Benzan you would have gone to war with
his father. So I let you believe it was Okona. <br>
OKONA: See how a man gets a reputation? <br>
BENZAN: If I had told you I was giving the Jewel to Debin's daughter,
you'd have disowned me. <br>
TROI: Now we're hearing some truth. <br>
KUSHELL: So you let me chase Okona when you knew he was innocent. <br>
BENZAN: Yes, because I didn't believe for one moment that you could
catch him. <br>
OKONA: Well, said. He never would have. <br>
BENZAN: And once Yanar accepted the Jewel the marriage would have been
made. <br>
YANAR: Well, I never got it. <br>
KUSHELL: Then Okona does have the jewel. <br>
OKONA: I never had the chance to deliver it.<br>
YANAR: Anyway it's too late. I won't marry Benzan. <br>
DEBIN: Then you'll marry Okona. <br>
YANAR: I won't marry anyone! </font></p>

all this, and maybe the timing and the approach is not the most
romantic, but I know you love Benzan and I don't want to see you throw
away that feeling just because your parents have been quarrelling for
years and don't know how to behave properly. I've carried your messages
back and forth for almost six months. I've smuggled each of you into
the other's homeland. You feel for him the same way he feels for you. <br>
