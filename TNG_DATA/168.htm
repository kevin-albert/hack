PICARD: On screen. <br>
DESOTO [on viewscreen]: Sorry to sneak up on you like that, Jean Luc <br>
PICARD: Robert, why didn't you inform us? <br>
DESOTO [on viewscreen]: Out here, you never know who's listening. Keeps
you on your toes, anyway. Hey, Will. Will, you getting soft on that
luxury liner? <br>
PICARD: So, old friend. How are you? <br>
DESOTO [on viewscreen]: Well, you know, they send you Galaxy Class boys
out here to the far reaches. Me, I'm just hauling my butt back and
forth between starbases. <br>
PICARD: But not today. <br>
DESOTO [on viewscreen]: No, not today. Starfleet's got new orders for
you. This is top priority. They need the fastest ship in the fleet and
the best people. That is you. <br>
PICARD: If time is so important, why didn't they transmit the orders by
subspace? <br>
DESOTO [on viewscreen]: They're worried about Romulan eavesdropping on
this one. And we've got a passenger for you. Hard to send by subspace. <br>
PICARD: What sort of passenger? <br>
DESOTO [on viewscreen]: Mission specialist. He'll bring your orders
aboard with him. His name is Tam Elbrun. <br>
RIKER: As in Tam Elbrun of the Ghorusda disaster? <br>
DESOTO [on viewscreen]: The same. What can I say? Your orders are to
cooperate fully with him. Best of luck, folks. Hood out. <br>

LAFORGE: So what happened? <br>
RIKER: It was a first contact situation. Ghorusdan culture is so
complex and different, that the Federation sent a specialist to prevent
misunderstanding. <br>
LAFORGE: So that was Tam Elbrun. What happened was his fault? <br>
RIKER: Not directly. Board of inquiry blamed Darson for carelessness
about Ghorusdan cultural taboos. But if Elbrun was so good, why didn't
he warn Darson? What was he doing there if he couldn't sense that much
hostility?

<br>
(The presentation is now up on the main screen) <br>
DATA: Our orders are to proceed to this star, Beta Stromgren.
Scientists have discovered that it is in the final stages of an
alternating cycle of expansion and collapse, and will soon result in a
supernova. However, the unmanned long range space probe sent by
Starfleet to observe the process has discovered something much more. <br>
TAM: Oh, Data don't waste time. They call it Tin Man. The Vega probe
found it orbiting Stromgren. <br>
LAFORGE: Looks like some kind of ship. <br>
TAM: Its energy source is unknown. The people who've studied the
transmissions think it's a starship. And they're sure it's alive. <br>
PICARD: Alive? How? <br>
LAFORGE: A cybernetic organism like the Borg? <br>
TAM: No, no, no. Here. Starfleet believes it's an organic creature,
born in space, living its life in the wastes between stars. No one
knows where it came from, or why it's here. But we're going to meet it.
We're going to talk to it.
I'm going to talk to it. <br>
RIKER: Have attempts been made <br>
TAM: To communicate with it by subspace. Of course. Linguacode,
universal translation, all that. It won't work. Tin Man
is too different. Direct mind to mind contact is our only hope. <br>
TROI: The opportunity for discovery is extraordinary but I don't
understand Starfleet's urgency. <br>
PICARD: Romulans. <br>
TAM: Hell, I forgot. The Romulans. <br>
PICARD: They claim that sector of space where Beta Stromgren is
located. <br>
WORF: The Romulans claim all that is in their field of vision. <br>
DATA: They routinely monitor the telemetry of our deep space probes. <br>
PICARD: Then they will certainly be sending a ship of their own to
investigate this Tin Man. <br>
TAM: No. Actually, they're sending two. Data? <br>
DATA: That is correct. Starbase one two three has detected two
D'daridex class cruisers on an intercept course. The top speed of this
class cruiser is known to be less than ours. Therefore we do have some
advantage. <br>
PICARD: Then, it's a race? An alien intelligence, a new life form,
representing a technology far beyond that of either the Romulans or
ourselves. The Romulans will certainly take whatever measures are
required to secure this creature for study. <br>
LAFORGE: Study as in dissecting, I'd bet. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, you are our resident honour student in exobiology.
I'm assigning you to head up the
Life Sciences on this mission. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
TAM: Excellent. <br>
PICARD: Meeting adjourned, then. <br>
(As everyone but Picard, Riker, Tam and Data leave) <br>
TAM: So, Data, I guess you're the brains of this outfit, huh? <br>
PICARD: Mister Elbrun, one of the reasons I'm asking you to work
closely with a member of my staff is to avoid any further omissions.
The possibility of an encounter with Romulans on this mission is hardly
trivial. And yet <br>
TAM: All right, all right. I should have brought up the Romulans
earlier, but I was distracted. And no, Billy boy, I wasn't
distracted on Ghorusda. If Darson had listened to me, no one would have
died. No? Well I don't care whether you believe that or not.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, supplemental. Travelling at high
warp, we are still several days from rendezvous with the mysterious
entity which Starfleet has christened Tin Man. My immediate concern is
with Tam Elbrun. Starfleet considers his unique abilities crucial to
our mission, yet he seems to me unstable.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: Well, according to his medical records and
psych profile, he's very high on the ESP scale. A sort of prodigy. <br>
PICARD: A prodigy? In what sense? <br>
TROI: Well, in most Betazoids our telepathic gifts develop at
adolescence. <br>
PICARD: You mean you're not born reading minds? <br>
TROI: No. Except for some reason that no one understands, occasionally
a Betazoid child is born different. <br>
PICARD: How different? <br>
CRUSHER: Born with his telepathic abilities switched on. <br>
TROI: Most Betazoids born like that never lead a normal life. <br>
CRUSHER: The noise of other people's thoughts and feelings must be
overwhelming, incomprehensible, especially to a child. <br>
TROI: And painful. Early diagnosis and special training did help Tam
adjust, but he has some problems. <br>
PICARD: You mentioned a hospitalisation. <br>
TROI: For stress. Repeatedly, throughout his life. <br>
CRUSHER: I always wonder what holds one person together through that
kind of struggle, while another goes under? <br>
PICARD: Yes, well, he's evidently done more than hold together. He's
the indispensable man. The Federation's finest specialist in
communication with unknown life forms. <br>
CRUSHER: The more unusual a life form is, the better he likes it. His
personnel file shows that he's gravitated toward assignments that
isolate him from other humanoids.

echo from my navigational sensors. <br>
WORF: Something is out there, sir, tracking us, matching our speed and
heading. Something which does not fully register on our instruments. <br>
DATA: Since there is no known natural phenomenon capable of travel at
warp velocities, there are but two possibilities. Either it is a sensor
malfunction, another ship is following us covertly. <br>
WORF: It is not a sensor malfunction. <br>
DATA: Agreed. <br>
WESLEY: But Commander, if it is a Romulan ship, with their cloaking
device we shouldn't pick them up at all. <br>
LAFORGE: Unless they're pulling so much power for something else that
they can't fully cloak. <br>
WESLEY: Like what? <br>
LAFORGE: Ask the Romulans. If it is the Romulans. <br>

warned Darson more forcefully. <br>
TROI: So, after that you ran away? The last I heard, you were the only
Federation delegate assigned to Chandra Five. <br>
TAM: Beautiful creatures, the Chandrans. Their minds are glacial. They
have a lovely three day ritual for saying hello. Peaceful, untroubled

TAM: Well, except for your friend Data. I like him. He's restful. <br>
TROI: I believe your impression of Data is probably unique. <br>
TAM: Yeah? Well, having to get to know someone, just once, has its
appeal. I mean, talking to them, instead of getting it all at once up
here whether I want it or not. <br>
TROI: But you accepted this mission. You could have stayed on Chandra
Five. You willingly came aboard a ship with over a thousand people. <br>

naked through space like a fish in the sea. Totally alien, mysterious,
not like us at all. Ancient. And alone. So lonely, for so long. <br>

Man. Aren't you? <br>
TAM: No. Well, yes, a little. But not quite on a conscious level. <br>

PICARD: Perhaps we can help it in some way. Can you ask it to return
with us to Federation space? At least persuade it to leave the vicinity
of Beta Stromgren, before the star explodes? <br>
TAM: Captain, Gomtuu knows that the star will go nova soon. That's why
it's here. It wants to die. There was an explosion in space. Radiation
penetrating the outer layers. The crew. Oh, the crew died. Such loss.
Empty pain, Hollowness. <br>
TROI: Tam. Stop this! You're losing yourself in this this merging. <br>
TAM: I know. I know. Tin Man hurts and wants to die. I can't do any
more from out here. If you want me to really reach Tin Man, I have got
to be in physical contact. I have got to go aboard. <br>
PICARD: No. That is absolutely out of the question. <br>
TAM: You don't trust me. <br>
PICARD: No, Tam, I don't believe that I do. Tam, when you reached out
to the alien, to warn it, did you give any thought to this vessel? To
the danger, however inadvertent, that creature might pose to our crew?
Or did you simply react out of instinct? <br>
TROI: Captain <br>
TAM: Deanna, he's right. I don't know. I don't know what might happen
but if you don't let me go, we fail our mission. Besides, at this
point, you need all the help you can get. Even Tin Man's.

affinity with Elbrun. Troi, you've known him for years. How far can he
be trusted? <br>
TROI: Captain, the issue isn't one of trust in Tam's intentions, but in
his judgment. I would trust him to do what he believes is right <br>
PICARD: Yes, of course. But his judgment <br>
TROI: Is precarious. The stress of exposure to so many minds on the
ship is bad enough. Now he's strongly drawn to this creature. I'm
afraid for him. <br>
PICARD: Afraid of what? <br>
TROI: I sense that the alien is somehow calling him. If we allow him to
do as he insists, to beam over, I'm believe that we will lose him to
it. That he will lose himself. <br>
DATA: Captain, I agree that Tam's motives are trustworthy, and I do not
believe it is possible that he will act against us, or will cause Tin
Man to act against us out of malice. <br>
TROI: Captain, if Tam breaks down over there, we'll be no closer to
accomplishing our mission. It would be a grave mistake. <br>
PICARD: Thank you both. <br>
(Troi leaves) <br>
PICARD: Data? <br>
DATA: I am puzzled, sir. We have come this far. Are you not going to
allow Tam to fulfill his mission? <br>
PICARD: Tam Elbrun warned Tin Man. The first thing it did was to
destroy a space vessel. <br>
DATA: I believe I understand, sir. If you feel the risk is too great to
send Tam Elbrun alone, then send me with him. <br>
PICARD: Counselor Troi understands him better. <br>
DATA: But he is more comfortable with me, sir. It is humanity he is
fleeing. Sir, I can serve as an intermediary, a bridge back. A reminder
of his obligations both to us and to Tin Man.
