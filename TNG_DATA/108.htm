Captain's log, stardate 41249.3. We have orbited the two major planets
of the Beta Renner system taking aboard delegates from those two
worlds. Since achieving space flight, their major life forms, the
Anticans and the Selay have become deadly enemies. But both have also
applied for admission into our Federation. We are to deliver these
delegates to this sector's neutral conference planet, called
Parliament, in the hope their dispute can be resolved.

be pleasant and comfortable. Arranging that will be my First Officer,

accommodations that we've <br>
SELAY: (orange cloak) We can already smell the Anticans. They were
taken aboard first? <br>
PICARD: Only because their world was the first on this heading to
Parliament. <br>
SELAY: Will our quarters be near the Anticans? <br>
RIKER: About one hundred metres apart. <br>
PICARD: Is that all right? <br>
SELAY: No. Unsatisfactory. <br>
RIKER: I believe we can accommodate your wishes. We'll rearrange the
suite assignments. If you'll follow me. <br>
SELAY: And we must be upwind from the Anticans. <br>

RIKER: I thought that had been taken care of in advance, Tasha. <br>
TASHA: So did we, sir. Their live animals were beamed aboard. We were
going to preserve the meat for them, but they say we must bring it to
them alive. <br>
RIKER: Then do so. Lieutenant Yar was confused. We no longer enslave
animals for food purposes. <br>
ANTICAN: But we have seen humans eat meat. <br>

Doctor Channing thinks it's possible to force dilithium into even more
useful crystals. If as shown here, matter and antimatter could be
aligned even more efficiently <br>

CRUSHER: A temporary mental aberration. <br>
PICARD: Doctor, when such a diagnosis concerns a bridge officer, I
expect a better explanation. <br>
CRUSHER: Then I will first have to run some crosschecks on the library
computer. Klingons are so unusual in their reactions, aren't they? <br>
PICARD: Use Science Station two, Doctor. <br>

PICARD: That energy cloud, Commander. I believe it important we have
another look at it. <br>
RIKER: But we're behind schedule for Parliament already. <br>
PICARD: I believe a very important scientific discovery awaits us on
this heading. <br>
TROI: Perhaps you'd like to share your reasoning on that, sir? <br>
DATA: Yes, since we obtained only minimal information on our sensor
pass of it. <br>
PICARD: Right, Data. We must go back to learn more. Counsellor, do you
believe a ship Captain should explain every order? <br>
TROI: Of course not, sir.

CRUSHER: Exactly what do you believe you're sensing from him? <br>
TROI: It's just a feeling that he's, well, that he's closed part of his
mind to me. I just feel that the Captain has become, perhaps dangerous.
<br>
RIKER: If he's dangerous. If. <br>
LAFORGE: Then he'd have to be relieved of command. Which you could do,
Doctor, but it's beaucoup trouble if you're wrong. <br>
DATA: And at the moment it is all pure speculation. He has done nothing
to subject the Enterprise to danger. <br>
CRUSHER: I'd need a medical log citing clear evidence of incapacity.
You could do it without that problem. <br>
RIKER: Only if all command officers agreed it vital to do so. But he
has not been showing any overt unusual behaviour. <br>
TROI: Ultimately, I believe he will. <br>
CRUSHER: As second in command, it's still in your corner. I'll order
medical and psychiatric exams. You'll have to back me up somehow.

Captain. <br>
PICARD: Oh? I'll be glad to do when I'm free. <br>
CRUSHER: I'd like to conduct them now, sir. <br>
PICARD: Why? What can I do for you, Number One? <br>
RIKER: Sir, Counsellor Troi has recommended the examinations. <br>
PICARD: Same question. Why? <br>
RIKER: It is my duty to inform the Captain we believe he may be under
some kind of alien influence which may constitute a danger to this
ship. <br>
PICARD: I consider it equally possible that the two of you, and
Counsellor Troi, are overworked, and possibly suffering hallucinations.
Now this is an order. You will arrange medical and psychiatric exams of
both yourself and them. Doctor, are you aware everybody is behaving
strangely? <br>
CRUSHER: I'm concerned that you've suddenly turned the ship away from
it's course. <br>
PICARD: What's happened to your mind, Doctor? The search for knowledge
is always our primary mission. I'm sorry, I really am too busy for this
kind of nonsense. Do I have to call Security to force you to report to
the Sickbay? <br>
CRUSHER: No, sir.

least within regulations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: We're now approaching the cloud, sir. <br>
RIKER: Very well, Mister La Forge. Bring us to within ten thousand
kilometres and hold us there. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. <br>
(Picard enters) <br>
RIKER: Shall we begin the scientific tests you wanted, sir? <br>
PICARD: Oh, they're already underway. I have an announcement for the
entire Bridge. As many of you suspected, when our ship passed through
the edge of this, it accidentally carried away a sentient being. Much
like these energy patterns we're seeing here. A terrifying experience
for any
intelligent being. As if a great claw had reached down and scooped one
of you from your home world. Drawn into the energy circuits of this
vessel, it found its way to you, Worf. Frantic at being carried from
its home world, and recognising you as sentient beings, it pleaded for
help, but in ways you
couldn't understand. Desperately going from person to person, and then
discovering the computer intelligence in this ship's memory circuits.
Oh, simplistic intelligence, but it furnished it enough to slow this
Enterprise thing that had captured it. And it very much regrets the
accidental death of Engineer Singh. <br>
TROI: Captain, do you exist in combination with this entity? <br>
RIKER: Is it in control of you, sir? <br>
PICARD: Very soon after we combined we had learned much about each
other. A passion for exploration, for the unknown. We found we had
similar dreams, and it offered your Captain a way to realise them
beyond human expectations. <br>
RIKER: Captain, I must speak to you privately now. <br>
DATA: I understand. As an energy pattern, free of the limitations of
matter, he might travel anywhere, at any velocity. <br>
RIKER: Captain, do you hear me? <br>
DATA: Sir, I see no way for you to journey with an energy form. <br>
PICARD: Isn't there? <br>
TROI: He's planning to beam himself and the entity into that cloud. <br>
PICARD: The transporter need not pattern your Captain into matter.
We'll beam energy only, and we will become a combined energy pattern of
our life forms. A resignation from this command and from Starfleet has
been appropriately recorded. <br>
RIKER: I refuse to allow this, sir. <br>
PICARD: How does this resignation threaten the ship and its crew in any
way? <br>
CRUSHER: Captain Picard, you are now relieved from duty. I judge you to
be disabled and mentally incapacitated. <br>
(Picard sends blue energy into the ship's systems and through all the
Bridge crew) <br>
RIKER: Security! Red Alert! Restrain the Captain! <br>
TASHA: Where is he? <br>
TROI: This is blinding me. <br>
WORF: Captain! I'll help you if you'll let me. <br>

energy) <br>

TROI: No, but the combination wasn't possible out there. He's in
trouble, sir. We have to beam him back. <br>
RIKER: Beam him back as what? He's nothing but energy now. <br>

might try to get in the same way if he's in trouble. <br>
RIKER: Bring us in closer, La Forge. <br>
LAFORGE: Moving in, sir, but where? <br>
RIKER: There's no way to know. Let's hope he can come part way himself.

He was the last one to beam out. <br>
RIKER: Is what you're thinking possible? <br>
DATA: Unknown at this time, sir. I hope the Captain remembers his
physical pattern is here. If he has, his energy has moved into the
transporter relays by now. <br>
RIKER: I wish we had some sign that he's in here. I guess we have no
choice but to risk it. <br>

to somewhere. And I remember there was talk of an entity? But it all
seems so vague. <br>

happened is naturally missing. <br>

Holmes? <br>

discovered a puddle of blood outside the Selay Quarters and they can't
find one of the delegates and so <br>
RIKER: Lieutenant. This couldn't have waited a moment? <br>
TASHA: It's good to see you, sir. The problem is that one of the cooks
has just been asked to broil reptile for the Anticans, and it looks
like the Selay delegate. <br>
