CRUSHER: This morning she was fifteen minutes late. That's the third
time this week. Jean-Luc, you don't have the slightest idea what I'm
talking about, do you. <br>
PICARD: No. I'm really sorry. I don't. <br>
CRUSHER: I've been telling you about Nurse Ogawa and Ensign Markson for
the last fifteen minutes. <br>
PICARD: You have? I'm really sorry. <br>
CRUSHER: Are you worried about this mission with the Kes? <br>
PICARD: Not worried exactly. This notion of admitting half of their
planet to the Federation while leaving the other half out. <br>
CRUSHER: First of all, the Kes are not half the planet, they're nearly
three quarters of it. And the Prytt are not being left out. They
themselves simply don't want to have contact with anyone from the
outside. not the Federation or anyone else. <br>
PICARD: Every member of the Federation entered as a unified world, and
that unity said something about them. That they had resolved certain
social and political differences and they were now ready to become part
a larger community. <br>
CRUSHER: By all indications, the Kes are a very unified, very
progressive people. <br>
PICARD: But the Prytt are not. They are reclusive to the point of
xenophobia. <br>
CRUSHER: Well, think about Earth. What if one of the old nation states,
say Australia, had decided not to join the World Government in twenty
one fifty? Would that have disqualified us as a Federation member? <br>

CRUSHER: What happened? <br>
PICARD: I don't know. <br>
CRUSHER: The last thing I remember we were beginning to transport. <br>
PICARD: I would assume we must be on Kesprytt. We're in some kind of
prison cell. The question is, why? I can't imagine that Ambassador
Mauric would have any reason to detain us. <br>
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc. <br>
PICARD: What is it? <br>
CRUSHER: Let me see. <br>
PICARD: What? <br>
(there's something sticking out of the back of his neck) <br>
CRUSHER: It looks like an implant. It seems to be connected directly to
the brainstem. <br>
(She's got one under her hair as well) <br>
PICARD: Some kind of coercive device? <br>
CRUSHER: Whatever it is I doubt it's designed for our health. <br>

PICARD: What is going on here? <br>
CRUSHER: If you tell us why you've taken us hostage, we might be able
to <br>
LORIN: (female) You are not hostages. You are prisoners. <br>
PICARD: Prisoners on whose authority? <br>
LORIN: You are being held under the authority of the Prytt Security
Ministry. The charges are conspiring with the enemy. <br>
PICARD: Enemy? You mean the Kes. <br>
LORIN: We're not fools. We are aware of the Federation attempt to
establish a military alliance with the Kes. It will not be tolerated. <br>
PICARD: Your information is incorrect. We have no plans to enter into
any <br>
LORIN: There is no point in trying to mislead us, Captain. The devices
which have been implanted in your cerebral cortexes will soon be
calibrated to your psi-wave pattern. At that time, we will be able to
get all the information we need. <br>
PICARD: And then you'll discover that we're telling the truth. <br>

I have run a complete diagnostic of all the targeting components. <br>
RIKER: Then what happened to the Captain and Doctor Crusher? <br>
WORF: Commander. The Transporter sensor log shows an unusual
concentration of antigraviton particles in the emitter coil. <br>
DATA: A concentration of antigraviton particles suggests a tractor
beam. It might have deflected the transporter beam to a different set
of coordinates. <br>
RIKER: Is there a way to locate those coordinates? <br>
DATA: The tractor beam originated somewhere in the Prytt Alliance. <br>
WORF: Why does the Prytt want Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher? <br>
RIKER: I don't know. And it's not going to be easy to find out. The
Prytt have consistently refused all outside contact. We're going to
have to work through the Kes. Contact Ambassador Mauric. Tell him I
want a meeting right now. <br>

CRUSHER: I was just thinking about how to get out of here. <br>
PICARD: There may be a structural flaw that would allow us to escape. <br>
CRUSHER: Right. <br>
PICARD: Beverly, the important thing during any confinement is to think
positively and not give up hope. There is a way out of every box, there
is a solution to every puzzle. It's just a matter of finding it. <br>

fails to stop the door closing again) <br>

PICARD: Does it work? <br>
CRUSHER: Yes. Except something's been added to the main directory. <br>
PICARD: It's a map. <br>
CRUSHER: An escape route. That guard must be working for the Kes. <br>
PICARD: Possibly. Or it could be part of a very carefully laid trap. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MAURIC: Commander, on behalf of my government, I
would like to take this opportunity to present my profound apologies
regarding this unfortunate incident. <br>
RIKER: That's very kind, Ambassador. But I don't think anyone here
holds you or the Kes government responsible for what's happened. <br>
TROI: Our primary concern is not to assign blame, but to recover our
missing officers. <br>
MAURIC: I agree. We are prepared to insert a hostage rescue team into
the Prytt capital city on three hours notice. <br>
RIKER: Ambassador, we have not even attempted a diplomatic effort yet.
I would rather not use force until we've exhausted all other options. <br>
MAURIC: I don't believe there is any diplomatic option, Commander. We
have no formal relations with the Prytt. No ambassadors. There's simply
no way to contact them. <br>
TROI: Surely you must have some means of communication in case of a
planetary emergency. <br>
MAURIC: We have never had need of such a system. <br>
WORF: We can determine their communications frequencies and establish a
link. <br>
MAURIC: Allow me to be blunt. The Prytt are a fanatical, xenophobic
people, with little regard for civilised discourse. Even if you do
establish communications link with them, it will be a complete waste of
time. <br>
TROI: How long has it been since your last diplomatic contact? <br>
MAURIC: Almost a century. <br>
TROI: Then it's possible they may have changed over the years. <br>
MAURIC: We have had other less formal contacts with the Prytt. Contacts
we cannot discuss. But I can assure you, they have changed very little.
<br>
RIKER: With all due respect, Ambassador, I think I should try to
communicate with the Prytt before I sanction the use of force. <br>
MAURIC: Of course, Commander. In the meantime, I will continue making
preparations for a rescue attempt. <br>
RIKER: Agreed. <br>
MAURIC: I do have one request. We believe that the Prytt obtained their
information about the transport of your captain and doctor through a
breach in our communications network. If I could set up a base of
operations here on the Enterprise, I'd feel much more secure. <br>
RIKER: Mister Worf will help you. <br>

we should go this way. I smell gas. <br>

compound. <br>

CRUSHER: I didn't say anything. There might be a fairly regular pattern
to these eruptions. We should be able to navigate out way through them

appears to be the primary access module for the central government. <br>

Prime Minister's office? <br>
DATA: I believe so, sir. However, the Prytt have no link designed for
extraterritorial communication. Our hail may come as a quite surprise
to them. <br>
RIKER: Well, they're going to have to adjust. Open a channel. <br>
PRYTT [OC]: This is Prime Minister Horath's headquarters. How can I be
of service? <br>
RIKER: This is Commander William T. Riker, Federation starship
Enterprise. I know this may seem an unusual way <br>

RIKER: That's right. <br>
PRYTT [OC]: Why are you on this comm. link? <br>

to start somewhere. If you would let me talk to your <br>
PRYTT [OC]: Did you get authorisation for this communication from the
Security Ministry? <br>
RIKER: As I said, we're having trouble contacting you <br>
PRYTT [OC]: I cannot participate in an unauthorised communication. This
transmission is terminated. <br>

LORIN [on monitor]: Enterprise, this is Security Minister Lorin. You
will immediately cease all attempts at communication with our people. <br>
RIKER: Minister, we've been attempting to contact someone in your
government. It appears that you have detained two of our officers. We
would like to discuss the situation. <br>
LORIN [on monitor]: There is nothing to discuss. If you do not
terminate these transmissions, we will be forced to take aggressive
action against your ship. <br>

WORF: Their weapon systems pose no threat to the Enterprise. <br>
RIKER: Just the same, let's keep the shields up for the time being. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
MAURIC: Is there a problem, Commander? <br>
RIKER: Our efforts with the Prytt just ran into a wall. <br>
MAURIC: I'm sorry. But perhaps this will brighten your spirits. We have
freed your Captain and doctor. <br>
RIKER: What? <br>
MAURIC: They were being held in prison just outside the Prytt capital.
One of our operatives was able to arrange their escape. <br>
WORF: Where are they now? <br>
MAURIC: Well, they should be en route to the Kes border. Our operative
provided them with a detailed map and instructions on where to go. <br>
RIKER: How will you get them across the border? <br>
MAURIC: At the moment, that information is confidential, but trust us,
we do have a plan. <br>
RIKER: Ambassador, I'm afraid I must insist that you provide us with
more information. <br>
MAURIC: I understand your concern, of course, but I would feel more
comfortable discussing these operational details in a less public
environment. <br>
RIKER: Certainly. We can step into the Ready room. <br>

You understand? <br>

AIDE: He is all right. <br>
RIKER: How do you plan to get our people out of Prytt territory? <br>
MAURIC: You must realise that everything I'm about to say cannot leave
this room. For some time, we have had certain friends among the Prytt.
Citizens who realise that the long struggle between our two peoples can
only end when the Prytt government is made to see reason. <br>
RIKER: You've recruited a few Prytt spies. <br>
MAURIC: That's a crude, but accurate term. These friends will be
waiting for your Captain and Doctor when they reach the village of Ohn
Kor near the Kes border. The map we provided your officers will take
them to a tavern there. <br>
RIKER: Forgive me, Ambassador, but is it wise to send two human
fugitives in Starfleet uniforms into a Prytt village? <br>
MAURIC: The danger is minimal. Our operatives control almost the whole
village. Once contact has been made with Captain Picard and Doctor
Crusher, our friends will escort them across the border into Kes. <br>
RIKER: I would still feel better if they could rendezvous with your
operatives in a less public place. <br>
MAURIC: Commander, I assure you we know what we're doing. We've had a
great deal of experience dealing with the Prytt. We'd hardly risk the
safety of your people. After all, we still hope you will recommend our
entrance into the Federation.

clutter there is in a consciousness. Odd memories coming to the
surface. Bits
of half-remembered songs. <br>

telepaths sift through it all. How can they really get to what

abrupt halt with the words, is that a beard or <br>
BOTH: Is your face dirty? <br>

embarrassed by that incident. <br>
CRUSHER: Yes. I thought I was being cute but I really hurt him. That
was a long time ago. I learned a valuable lesson. <br>

see a Prytt soldier on the next ridge) <br>
CRUSHER: I don't think so, either. Maybe we can find another way to
reach the village. <br>
PICARD: No. It's several kilometres to find another way around that
ridge. The border is just two kilometres east of here. There's a
forcefield protecting it, but we can find some way to deal with that
when we get there. Come on.

expose several of our undercover operatives in the process. But what
you didn't expect was for us to get your people out of prison so
quickly. They needed more time. They needed more time to plot the
destruction of the Kes with their new Prytt friends. <br>
RIKER: This is ridiculous. You're beginning to see conspiracies
everywhere. We were invited here by the Kes. Why would we ally
ourselves with the Prytt? <br>
MAURIC: Indeed, why? <br>
RIKER: You can believe what you like. We're going to find our people
with or without your help. <br>
MAURIC: Then I believe it's time for us to be leaving the Enterprise. <br>
RIKER: Fine. Make sure you take all this junk with you.

PICARD: No luck? <br>
CRUSHER: I'm beginning to think there's not a single thing on this
planet we can eat. <br>
PICARD: Well, by this time tomorrow we could be back on the Enterprise
and you can plant yourself in front of a replicator with a knife and
fork. <br>
CRUSHER: Remember that Vulcan dish I promised you for breakfast? I was
just. You hate having breakfast with me. <br>
PICARD: That's not true. <br>
CRUSHER: Yes, it is. When I said breakfast, I heard you say, I hate
that. <br>
PICARD: That's not quite what I meant. <br>
CRUSHER: Well, then what did you mean? <br>
PICARD: It's just that I don't like <br>
CRUSHER: What I've been choosing for breakfast recently. <br>
PICARD: You see, I think that breakfast should be a simple meal and
recently you've been ordering these elaborate things. <br>
CRUSHER: Coffee and croissants, that's all you really want, isn't it?
Coffee and croissants. Well why didn't you just say so? <br>
PICARD: I didn't think it was important. You don't like those elaborate
meals either. <br>
CRUSHER: No, I usually prefer something simple myself but I thought you
might enjoy more variety. Well, I guess it's Coffee and croissants for
both of us from now on. <br>
BOTH: I love firelight. <br>
PICARD: There's something about the flame, the smell of the smoke. It's
always seemed to me to be intoxicating, somehow. <br>
CRUSHER: I remember when Jack and I took Wesley on his first camping
trip to Balfour Lake. Wesley kept throwing manta leaves in the fire,
watching them pop. Jack kept telling him. What? Jean-Luc, I heard you.
Don't push it away. When I said Jack and I, I felt this sudden wave of
something. I didn't know you felt that way. <br>
PICARD: Didn't you? <br>
CRUSHER: I guess I always knew that there was an attraction between us
right from the start, but I never knew how strongly you felt. Why
didn't you ever tell me you were in love with me? <br>
PICARD: You were married to my best friend. At first I thought it was
harmless infatuation. Something hormonal rather than emotional. <br>
CRUSHER: Then when the months went by and the three of us began
spending more time together. <br>
PICARD: I realised that it was something else, and it wasn't right. But
although I would never act on it, I couldn't help the way I felt. <br>
CRUSHER: And when Jack died you felt guilty. <br>
PICARD: I felt guilty before he died&gt; Having feelings like that
for my best friend's wife. And then later, after the accident, I
promised myself that I would never tell you know how I felt. It would
be like betraying my friend <br>
CRUSHER: That's why you didn't want me on the Enterprise seven years
ago. <br>
PICARD: I didn't know how I would react. And then, little by little, I
realised that I didn't have those feelings any more. Twenty years is,
after all, a long time. <br>
CRUSHER: And now we're friends. <br>
PICARD: Yes, friends. <br>
CRUSHER: Well, we still have a lot of ground to cover tomorrow. We
should get some sleep. <br>
PICARD: Right. <br>

Hail Minister Lorin, please. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
LORIN [on viewscreen]: Enterprise, I have warned you about these
unauthorised communications. <br>
RIKER: Yes, I know, but I think it's about time we all sat down
together and tried to work this out. I have Ambassador Mauric here <br>
LORIN [on viewscreen]: That is your misfortune. We have nothing to say
to either of you. <br>

deal with the Kes would be capable of such an outrage. <br>
RIKER: I'm sorry to resort to such drastic measures, Minister, but you
left me little choice. <br>
MAURIC: Don't pretend the two of you are enemies. It's too late for
charades. <br>
LORIN: If that is an attempt to hide your military alliance with the
Federation, you needn't bother. I already know far more than you can
imagine. <br>
RIKER: Let's all just sit down and try to talk about what's happened to
Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher. <br>
LORIN: I will not sit at a table with him. <br>

start talking. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LORIN: We are already aware of your plan to use
Federation technology to build new attack satellites. You will find
that we are prepared for them. <br>
MAURIC: That is an interesting but pointless lie. I'd rather discuss
your own plans to use Federation aid to stage a takeover of Kolrod
Island. <br>
LORIN: We have been over this before. Kolrod clearly belongs to the
Prytt who originally <br>
RIKER: That's it! I can see that diplomacy is not going to get us
anywhere today, and I do not have time for to negotiate. So let's put
all of our cards on the table. You're concerned the Kes are going to be
admitted to the Federation. <br>
LORIN: Correct. <br>
RIKER: As First Officer of the Enterprise I think I can promise you
that's not going to happen. The Kes will be denied membership. <br>
MAURIC: You have no authority to make that decision. Despite whatever
games you played with the Prytt when you arrived, we still plan to take
our petition directly to the Federation Council. They'll listen <br>
RIKER: They will also listen to the reports of the Captain of the
Enterprise and his First Officer. And I can tell you right now the
First Officer's report will go something like this. Kesprytt, a deeply
troubled world with social, political, and military problems they have
yet to resolve. The Kes, while a friendly and democratic people, are
driven by suspicion, deviousness, and paranoia. It is the opinion of
this officer they are not ready for membership. Now, the matter of our
missing officers. <br>
LORIN: They are still charged with spying, Commander. I have heard
nothing here which would alter that. <br>
RIKER: Then maybe you should consider this. If anything happens to
them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation, which means more
starships will be coming to Kesprytt and those ships are going to want
answers which puts your country under a very large and very
uncomfortable microscope. Remember how unhappy you were when we
contacted just one of your people without authorisation? Well, just
think of what it'll be like. Ten starships asking questions, contacting
hundreds of your people. Massive sensor sweeps. They may even start
sending down away teams. All because you wouldn't help me find my
missing officers. </font></p>

got to hear some very interesting dreams of yours. <br>

he's asleep. <br>CRUSHER: What about when he's awake? <br>
PICARD: So now that we've had this unique experience, what do we do? <br>
CRUSHER: What do you mean? <br>
PICARD: You know exactly what I mean. <br>
CRUSHER: No, I don't. The implant's been removed, remember? <br>
