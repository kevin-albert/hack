KIRK: I'm not a drama critic. ...Well, Mister Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?<br>
SAAVIK: Permission to speak candidly, sir?<br>
KIRK: Granted.<br>
SAAVIK: I don't believe this was a fair test of my command abilities.<br>
KIRK: And why not?<br>
SAAVIK: Because ...there was no way to win.<br>
KIRK: A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?<br>
SAAVIK: No sir. It has not.<br>
KIRK: How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?<br>
SAAVIK: As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.<br>
KIRK: Well, now you have something new to think about. Carry on.<br>

students and equipment. As I recall you took the test three times

brings me in a case every now and then across the Neutral Zone. Now

KIRK: Bones, I don't want to be lectured.<br>
McCOY: What the hell do you want? ...This is not about age, ...and you
know it. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you
wanna be out there hopping Galaxies.<br>
KIRK: Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties.<br>
McCOY: Bull. You're hiding ...hiding behind rules and regulations.<br>
KIRK: Who am I hiding from?<br>

seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the
contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?<br>
CHEKOV: You lie! On Ceti Alpha Five there was life, a fair chance.<br>
KHAN: This is Ceti Alpha Five. ...Ceti Alpha Six exploded six months
after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of this planet and
everything was laid waste. Admiral Kirk ...never bothered to check on
our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered
intellect that enabled us to survive! On Earth, ...two hundred years
ago, ...I was a prince, ...with power over millions.<br>
CHEKOV: Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.<br>

Six! Why are you here? ...Why are you here? ...Why? ...Allow me
introduce you to Ceti Alpha Five's only remaining indigenous lifeform.
...What do you think? They've killed twenty of my people, including my
beloved wife. ...Oh, not all at once, ...and not ...instantly, to be
sure. ...You see, their young enter through the ears ...and wrap
themselves around the cerebral cortex. This has the effect of rendering
the victim extremely susceptible to suggestion. Later, ...they grow,
...follows madness. ...And death.<br>

be so bold, it was a mistake for you to accept promotion. Commanding a
starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of

KIRK: Summary, please.<br>
CAROL (on viewscreen): Project Genesis. A proposal to the Federation.<br>
SPOCK: Carol Marcus.<br>
KIRK: Yes.<br>
CAROL (on viewscreen): What exactly is Genesis? Well, put simply,
Genesis is life from lifelessness. It is a process whereby molecular
structure is reorganised at he subatomic level into life-generating
matter of equal mass. Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the
laboratory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless
underground. Stage Three will involve the process on a planetary scale.
It is our intention to introduce the Genesis device into the
pre-selected area of a lifeless space body, such a moon or other dead
form. The device is delivered, instantaneously causing what we call the
Genesis Effect. Matter is reorganised with life-generating results.
...Instead of a dead moon, a living, breathing planet, capable of
sustaining whatever lifeforms we see fit to deposit on it.<br>
SPOCK: Fascinating!<br>
CAROL: (on viewscreen) The reformed moon simulated here represents the
merest fraction of the Genesis potential, should the Federation wish to
fund these experiments to their logical conclusion. When we consider
the cosmic problems of population and food supply, the usefulness of
this process becomes clear. This concludes our proposal. Thank you for
your attention.<br>
SPOCK: It literally is Genesis.<br>
KIRK: The power of creation.<br>
SPOCK: Have they proceeded with their experiment?<br>
KIRK: Well, the tape was made about a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Stage Two by now.<br>
McCOY: But, dear Lord, do you think we're intelligent enough to...
Suppose, what if this thing were used where life already exists?<br>
SPOCK: It would destroy such life in favour of its new matrix.<br>
McCOY: It's new matrix? ...Do you have you any idea what you're saying?<br>
SPOCK: I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor.
As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy
than to create.<br>
McCOY: Not anymore! Now we can do both at the same time! According to
myth, the Earth was created in six days. Now, watch out! Here comes
Genesis, we'll do it for you in six minutes.<br>
SPOCK: Really, Doctor McCoy, you must learn to govern your passions. They will be your undoing. Logic suggests...<br>
