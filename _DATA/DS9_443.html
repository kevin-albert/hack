the hospital on New Bajor, the first Bajoran colony in the Gamma
Quadrant.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: Could you take it for a while? <br>
BASHIR: Sure. Do you mind if I listen to some music? <br>
KIRA: Actually, I do. I was hoping to meditate for a few minutes. <br>
BASHIR: Of course. I didn't know you meditate. <br>
KIRA: Every day. <br>
BASHIR: I had the opportunity to study meditation with Isam Helewa when
I was in college. A remarkable fellow. He sort of took me under his
wing. I can't tell you how much I learned from him. The man was a
master at rhythmic breathing. <br>
KIRA: You'll have to give me a few tips some time. <br>
BASHIR: Gladly. Oh, and I'd be more than interested in learning any
Bajoran meditation techniques you'd like to show me. <br>
KIRA: We just usually like to sit quietly. <br>
(Bashir breathes in through his nose then out in a series of loud
ha!s.) <br>
KIRA: What are you doing? <br>
BASHIR: Bellows breath. It's a series of quick intakes followed by one
long intake of air through the nose. Hold, release. Increases the
energy flow. It's quite simple. Let me show you. <br>
KIRA: How about some music? <br>
BASHIR: What's your pleasure? <br>
KIRA: I'm afraid my musical knowledge is limited to Bajoran composers. <br>
BASHIR: Computer, play us a little something by Tor Jolan. <br>
KIRA: You know Tor's work? <br>
BASHIR: I've made it a point to listen to Bajoran music ever since I
arrived. <br>
KIRA: Really. <br>
BASHIR: Tor strikes me as the best of the lot, really. Slightly
derivative of the Boldaric masters of the last century but pleasantly
diverting. This is nice. I'm glad we're finally doing this. <br>
KIRA: What? <br>
BASHIR: Talking to one another. Finding common interests. Burying the
hatchet. <br>
KIRA: Hatchet? <br>
BASHIR: A human expression. It means that we're finally putting past
conflicts behind us. <br>
KIRA: Making way for brand new ones. <br>
BASHIR: Right. You know, Nerys. May I call you Nerys? <br>
KIRA: Sure. <br>
BASHIR: Even when we weren't getting along, I've always felt you were
one of the most interesting women I'd ever met. I'm very serious. <br>
KIRA: Thank you. Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: Julian. Go on, say it. Julian. <br>
KIRA: Julian. <br>
BASHIR: It was hard for Chief O'Brien as well at first. We had our
problems ourselves, but now we're like this. <br>
KIRA: One minute to the wormhole. Stand by to drop to impulse. <br>
BASHIR: Would you like to have dinner sometime? <br>
KIRA: I think you'd better stick with Dax. <br>
BASHIR: I'm sorry? Oh, you thought that I was trying to? No, no, no. <br>
KIRA: My mistake. <br>
BASHIR: But if I thought <br>
KIRA: Forget it. <br>
BASHIR: Right. <br>
KIRA: Take us out of warp. (Judder) What's wrong? <br>
BASHIR: The warp field's not fully collapsed. I'm showing a plasma
injector leak. <br>
KIRA: Injector controllers are locked. I'm trying to compensate. <br>
(WHOOSH. It's a rough ride in the wormhole) <br>
KIRA: Injectors opening. Velocity falling. <br>
(There's a big flash.)&nbsp;<br>
BASHIR: What was that? <br>
KIRA: Initiating emergency stabilisation control. <br>
(Another flash as everything calms down.) <br>
BASHIR: Are you all right? <br>
KIRA: A little dizzy. <br>
BASHIR: Me too. I guess we're lucky to be in one piece. <br>
(WHOOSH) <br>
KIRA: We'd better get O'Brien to take a look. What the hell? <br>
(DS9 isn't there) <br>
BASHIR: Where's the station? What happened to the station? <br>
KIRA: I have it on long range sensors. It's orbiting Bajor? <br>
BASHIR: Major, vessel approaching on an intercept course dead ahead. <br>
(A bird of Prey arrives and two armed Klingons beam in) <br>
KIRA: What is this? <br>
KLINGON: I'm sorry, ma'am. We were not informed you had left the
station. <br>
KIRA: Who are you? <br>
KLINGON: (backing away and bowing) We were on standard patrol when your
vessel seemed to appear out of nowhere. If you will allow us to
withdraw, we will escort you back to the station. <br>

cannot be an imposter. <br>
GARAK: (in Cardassian uniform) But she is. <br>
(Bashir and Kira enter through the airlock.) <br>
KIRA: What is going on here? <br>
BASHIR: Garak? <br>
GARAK: Yes. My name is Garak. <br>
INTENDANT: The question is who are you? <br>
(Kira stares at her leather-clad double as we go to the opening titles)
<br>
BASHIR: This may seem like an odd question, but could you tell us where
we are? <br>
GARAK: This is the Terok Nor station, the centre of authority for the
Bajoran sector. <br>
BASHIR: Centre of authority. Whose authority? <br>
GARAK: The Alliance, of course. <br>
KIRA: Something is very wrong here. I think we took a wrong turn in the
wormhole. <br>
GARAK: Wormhole? <br>
KIRA: The wormhole to the Gamma. It's very difficult to explain. I
think it would be best if we just to got back to our ship and <br>
INTENDANT: No. I don't think so. <br>
BASHIR: Now wait a minute. <br>
GARAK: Don't take that tone with me, Terran. <br>
BASHIR: Terran? <br>
INTENDANT: If you are whom I suspect you are, I'm afraid I can't run
the risk of letting you go. Take that one below. Put him to work. Tell
the supervisor to keep an eye on him. He won't know the rules. <br>

TELOK: Intendant! <br>
INTENDANT: What is it you need, Telok? <br>
TELOK: (a Klingon) This Terran was caught trying to stow away on one of
the freighters leaving the station. <br>
INTENDANT: What is your designation. <br>
HUMAN: Zero four one three theta. <br>
INTENDANT: Theta. <br>
HUMAN: Yes, ma'am. <br>
INTENDANT: You worked so hard to earn your Theta designation, to earn
our trust. Why do you throw it away like this? Reassign him to Lambda.
Send him to the mines. <br>
GARAK: The mines? But he should die for this. We should make an example
of him. <br>
INTENDANT: You have made a career out of setting examples, Garak. I
think you enjoy it too much. <br>
GARAK: He could not have gotten on board that ship without help. This
is the third incident in a month. At least allow me to interrogate him.
<br>
INTENDANT: Fine. Interrogate him. But if he dies under your
interrogation I will make you my example. Is that clear? <br>
GARAK: Very, Intendant.

ODO: Well, we'll see to it that he learns them. What's your

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">INTENDANT: Sit down. You are me, aren't you. <br>
KIRA: I am Kira Nerys. <br>
INTENDANT: That makes two of us. Where you come from, things are very
much like this, aren't they? There's a station, a Bajor, Cardassians,
Terrans, Klingons. <br>
KIRA: The players are the same, but everyone seems to be playing
different parts. <br>
INTENDANT: You didn't seem to recognise the Alliance. <br>
KIRA: No. <br>
INTENDANT: Perhaps you'd recognise the name Kirk. <br>
KIRA: I'm sorry, I don't. <br>
INTENDANT: Interesting. On my side, Kirk is one the most famous names
in our history.
<a href="../StarTrek/39.htm" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Almost a century ago, a Terran
starship Captain named James Kirk accidentally exchanged places with
his counterpart from your side due to a transporter
accident</a>. Our Terrans were barbarians then, but their Empire
was strong. While your Kirk was on this side, he met a Vulcan named
Spock and somehow had a profound influence on him. Afterwards, Spock
rose to Commander in Chief of the Empire by preaching reforms,
disarmament, peace. It was quite a remarkable turnabout for his people.
Unfortunately for them, when Spock had completed all these reforms, his
empire was no longer in any position to defend itself against us. <br>
KIRA: Us? <br>
INTENDANT: The Alliance. The historic coming together of the Klingons
and the Cardassians. <br>
KIRA: And Bajor is part of this Alliance? <br>
INTENDANT: We'd been under Terran occupation for decades. When we were
freed, we petitioned for entry and were accepted. We have become quite
an influential power within the Alliance. Is it similar at all on your
side? <br>
KIRA: No. My Bajor is not so fortunate. <br>
INTENDANT: I'd be very interested to hear more about it. <br>
KIRA: I can't stay here. You must see that. <br>
INTENDANT: Well, you see, that's part of the problem. I don't know how
to send you back. But, more than that, there is a certain protocol I'm
supposed to follow. <br>
KIRA: I'm not sure what you mean. <br>
INTENDANT: After the first crossover, we were afraid that others might
come to interfere in our affairs. It was decided then that if it ever
happened again, we would promptly dispose of anyone who appeared from
your side. <br>
KIRA: I see. <br>
INTENDANT: Unlike my First Officer, Mister Garak, I have no taste for
violence. I regret using it even when it seems necessary. <br>
KIRA: I know exactly what you mean. <br>
INTENDANT: You do, don't you? <br>
KIRA: I know you don't want to kill me and you're searching for a good
reason not to. <br>
INTENDANT: Got any ideas? <br>
KIRA: My side needs what you have. A strong Bajor. If you knew the
struggles we've been through to rebuild our world. Who's to say you
won't influence us this time? <br>
INTENDANT: Me? <br>
KIRA: My side once changed the course of your history. Well, maybe this
time your side can change mine. Maybe you can teach me what I need to
become the leader of Bajor as you have. <br>
INTENDANT: That appeals to me. <br>
KIRA: If I can find a way back. <br>
INTENDANT: But I will have to kill your friend. <br>
KIRA: No. Don't. If you knew him. He's an arrogant Terran who's lived a
privileged life on my side. Let him see how the other half lives. <br>
INTENDANT: No, it's too dangerous. The Cardassians and the Klingons
would never allow it. <br>
KIRA: Are you the leader of this sector or not? <br>
INTENDANT: You know how to manipulate me. <br>
KIRA: I know how I'd feel in your place. I wouldn't give a damn what
the Cardassians or the Klingons thought. <br>
INTENDANT: You're right. I don't. <br>
(A Cardassian woman enters) <br>
INTENDANT: Find this attractive young woman some quarters. Kira Nerys,
I'll call for you later.

KIRA: No, I've worked in ore processing myself. Is my Terran friend
behaving himself? <br>
ODO: They all behave themselves when I'm in charge. <br>

Academy. So that's where we are. <br>
KIRA: That's where we are. <br>
BASHIR: Is there another me here? <br>
KIRA: Not on this station. I haven't found Dax or Sisko. <br>
BASHIR: O'Brien's been tinkering around with the machines. Major, if
Kirk got here using a transporter, do you think we can get back the
same way? <br>
KIRA: I don't know anything about transporters, do you? <br>
BASHIR: No one knows more about transporters than Chief O'Brien. <br>
KIRA: Our Chief O'Brien. Who knows about theirs? <br>
BASHIR: It's worth a shot. <br>

be willing to help.

done when no one else can. You know what I mean? Sometimes he even gets
things done behind the backs of the security people. <br>

KIRA: Oh, all sorts of favours, like getting me things I need. <br>

KIRA: Well, for instance, a transporter for a few hours. <br>
QUARK: Didn't I hear somewhere that a transporter was involved in the
first crossover? <br>

circumstances, I might be willing to help you get access to a
transporter. <br>

don't even think about it. <br>

QUARK: I have nothing but respect for you, Intendant. I am so sorry. <br>
INTENDANT: You did it because you felt sorry for these Terrans. You
hate to see them suffer just as I do. <br>
QUARK: Yes, Intendant. <br>
INTENDANT: But where would we be without them? Who would perform the
labour for the Alliance? A quick death. Don't make him suffer any more.
<br>
QUARK: No, Intendant, please. I made a mistake. Have mercy. Please. No.

GARAK: Lovely. I do admire a well-tailored gown. <br>
KIRA: What are you doing in my quarters, Garak? <br>
GARAK: She's never going to let you leave, you know. Can't you tell?
She's in love. <br>
KIRA: What are you talking about? <br>
GARAK In love with you, my dear. She's all a-twitter about you, can't
talk about anyone else. You're the perfect gift for the girl who has
everything. She's taken you into her heart like a Drathan puppy lig
left on her doorstep. Who else could she share her deepest secrets
with, tell her troubles to, trust with her life? <br>
KIRA: All you have to do is take a look at the guard outside to see how
much she trusts me. <br>
GARAK: I arranged the guard. Oh, she trusts you. As much as she trusts
anyone. So who better to betray her? <br>
KIRA: You're taking quite a risk coming to me like this. <br>
GARAK: True career advancement requires risk. Consider my offer
carefully, my dear. She'll never let you go. I will. If you want to
leave, you'll assist me. <br>
KIRA: How? <br>
GARAK: By taking her place. <br>
KIRA: What? <br>
GARAK: Tomorrow morning, she will be gone. <br>
KIRA: Gone? <br>
GARAK: She will be gone. Please, don't make me use some foolish
euphemism. You will assume her place as Intendant and announce that
your counterpart from the other side has returned to wherever she came
from. In a few weeks, you will step down to embark on some spiritual
journey, to explore your pagh or whatever, and I will take your place
as Intendant. <br>
KIRA: What about my friend? <br>
GARAK: The good Doctor, yes. He'll be taken off the station and treated
to as much hospitality as we Cardassians can offer until you resign,
and then you can be happily reunited. Oh, but I've made arrangements
with his supervisor that if you should decide to decline my offer,
tomorrow it will be your doctor friend who will be gone.

BASHIR: Why my back? What kind of danger? <br>
KIRA: We've got to find a way back to the runabout. <br>

KIRA: Not if you save her life. <br>
SISKO: Her life? <br>
KIRA: Garak is planning to kill her. Tonight. <br>
SISKO: That's it? That's the valuable information? Garak has been

worry about it. <br>

SISKO: You're disturbing my nap. <br>
KIRA: The Benjamin Sisko I know would never sell his soul and allow
himself to become a part of this tyranny against his own people. <br>
SISKO: Terrans don't have souls. We don't believe in them. <br>
KIRA: What do Terrans believe in? Raising their children to dig the ore
out of the mines for the Alliance? I worked in mines too till I was old
enough to start fighting for my freedom. <br>
SISKO: What do you care about Terran's freedom? <br>
KIRA: I care about freedom. What I don't understand is why you don't
care. Why the only one on this station I have met who seemed to give a
damn was a Ferengi toad named Quark. <br>
SISKO: You're looking in the wrong place for a hero, ma'am. I've made
the best of a bad life for my crew. That's my contribution. <br>

know you're no less a victim than anyone else here.

head so the knife is put away again.) <br>

from what I've heard, I think your kind has a lot to learn. <br>
BASHIR: We've got a lot to learn? What a laugh. <br>
INTENDANT: Quiet. On this side, Terran workers do not speak to their
superiors as you do. They certainly do not murder them. He was the only
one of his kind, the man you killed. Do you realise that? He's
irreplaceable. No one ran that operation as efficiently as he did. No
one kept order among the workers as he did. This is my reward for
treating you Terrans with the least bit of respect. Very well. I can
learn from my mistakes. You want to set an example, Garak? Use him. Set
an example for all Terrans. Let him die slowly in public view on the
Promenade. Let his pleads for mercy echo through the corridors for all
Terrans to hear. <br>

you, O'Brien, you tinkerer and putterer and fixer of broken things,
you've been a perfect theta for years. What could have possibly gotten
into you. What were you thinking? <br>
O'BRIEN: Do you want an answer, Intendant? <br>
INTENDANT: Yes! <br>
O'BRIEN: This man. This man is a doctor where he comes from. And
there's an O'Brien there just like me, except he's some kind of high up
Chief of Operations. They're Terrans. Can you believe that? Maybe it's
a fairy tale he made up, but it made me start thinking how each of us
might have turned out if history had been just a little different. I
wanted him to take me with him because whatever it's like where he's
from, it's got to be better than this. There's got to be something
better than this. <br>
