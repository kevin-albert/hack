deep space, something watches Voyager approach. It is then beamed
aboard, and we get its viewpoint in black and white.) <br>
TORRES: It's extraordinary. <br>
TUVOK: I must remind you that it is also a potential security risk. <br>
TORRES: It's losing power. I'd like to move it to Engineering to see if
I can repair it before it drains completely. <br>
TUVOK: I suggest we allow the power to drain. We should take the
opportunity to examine it while it is idle. Then we can decide if it is
wise to repair it. <br>
TORRES: Captain, this thing has a completely unfamiliar power source.
Once it stops working it's very possible I won't be able to get it
going again, and we'll have lost an opportunity to study a new
technology. <br>
JANEWAY: This is a ship of exploration, Mister Tuvok. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Still
black and white, from the object's viewpoint.) <br>
TORRES: The power's surging. If we can't find a way to stabilise it,
we're going to lose it. <br>
KIM: What about an interface with an EPS power conduit? <br>
TORRES: Well, the energy signatures are incompatible, but it might buy
us some time. Okay, let's give it a try. Two second burst, five percent
maximum output. On my mark. Now. We're losing it. <br>
KIM: Maybe we're overloading it's systems. <br>
TORRES: Let's try a longer burst at lower power. <br>
KIM: Got it. Five seconds at three percent, on your mark. <br>
TORRES: Now. I think it's working. EPS flow is holding steady. EM field
leakage is minimal. <br>
KIM: We'll have to watch the pressure on the connectors. <br>
TORRES: Let's try to keep it below eighty five percent. <br>
KIM: Flux capacitance is spiking intermittently, but I don't think
that's a problem. <br>
TORRES: Let's reinforce the power conduit coupling just to be on the
safe side. <br>
(The object zooms in on a monitor to reveal that it is a silver robot.
After the opening titles, we're back to colour and normal viewpoint.) <br>
TORRES: It's suffered a lot of damage, but I think the EPS charge will
keep it running for at least eighteen hours. <br>
KIM: It's not a cyborg. It's completely robotic. No organic components
of any kind. <br>
TORRES: This looks like some kind of programming centre. <br>
KIM: But I'm not detecting any pathways for transmitting information. <br>
TORRES: It's got arms, legs, we saw it move it's head. It's clearly
designed to perform motor functions. So where did those commands come
from? <br>
KIM: Maybe it needs to interface with a outside source. <br>
TORRES: Speaking of sources, this energy module seems to be what powers
the entire mechanism. It isn't designed to run on EPS energy, it runs
on some kind of super-conducting plasma. If we keep charging it, we may
end up destroying it. <br>
(The robot starts making stacatto noises.) <br>
TORRES: It's trying to communicate. <br>
KIM: We don't know that. It may just be some kind of recording. <br>
3947: One one one one one. Pralor Pralor. One one. Pralor Pralor Pralor
Pralor. <br>
TORRES: What are you trying to say? What's Pralor? If you can hear me,
try to move, try to move your arm. <br>
(Torres waves her own arm in front of its eyes.) <br>
KIM: B'Elanna, we don't even know if it can see you, much less
understand a word you're saying. <br>
TORRES: We've got to figure out a way to fix it. <br>
KIM: We've been trying for hours. We need a break. The EPS charge
should hold till morning. <br>
TORRES: You go ahead. I could use some time alone to think. <br>
KIM: If you're staying, I'm staying. <br>
TORRES: Get some rest, Harry. <br>
KIM: You may think you're tougher than everybody else, B'Elanna Torres,
but I can go without sleep just as long as you can. <br>
TORRES: Don't make me laugh, Starfleet. And don't make me pull rank on
you either. <br>
KIM: If you insist. But let me know if you come up with anything,
Lieutenant. </font></p>

Engineers log, supplemental. I've tried thirteen different methods of
reinitialising the robot's power source and I'm still having no luck,

Neelix, I need another pot of coffee. <br>
NEELIX: Even though breakfast isn't officially served for another hour
and a half, I'd be happy to pour you a glass of Traggle nectar. I will
even fix you my special Jibalian seven spice omelette. <br>
TORRES: Just coffee. <br>
NEELIX: I'm sorry, B'Elanna, but two pots of Landras blend is the
absolute limit. <br>
TORRES: You're cutting me off? Oh, I guess you're right. It was
starting to taste almost palatable. <br>
NEELIX: Still no idea how to revive our mechanised guest. <br>
TORRES: All I've been able to do is postpone the inevitable. The
constant power depletion is like a bleeding artery, and I haven't got a
tourniquet. <br>
NEELIX: I remember when I was trying to perfect the recipe for my
Jibalian omelette. I tried everything, a little more spith basil, a
little less prishic, but I couldn't get it right. Finally I fell asleep
from exhaustion right there at the counter. And then, in a dream, it
came to me. I was using six spices, but the omelette needed seven. <br>
TORRES: Let me guess. Leola root. <br>
NEELIX: Nimian sea salt, actually. <br>
TORRES: Salt? <br>
NEELIX: Yes, salt, the most common spice in the galaxy. But I was too
tired, so I couldn't see it. <br>
TORRES: That is a very interesting story, Neelix. Now how about some
more coffee. <br>
NEELIX: To bed. I said, to bed. <br>
TORRES: I'm going. I'm going. </font></p>

bench by the warp core, and knocks on its head.) <br>
TORRES: Anybody home? What's that? You think I should go to bed too?
Well, I guess I'm outnumbered. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
Computer, activate Emergency Medical Holographic Programme. <br>
EMH: Please state the nature. If there has been a change in the
official dress code I certainly wish someone would have informed me. <br>
TORRES: This is what I sleep in. I didn't have time to change. <br>
EMH: I see. May I assume your haste is an indication that you have a
medical problem of some kind. <br>
TORRES: An engineering problem actually, but I thought you might have
some insight. <be> EMH: Hmm. I shouldn't have to remind you, I'm
a doctor <br>
TORRES: Not an engineer, right, but this isn't a typical engineering
problem. I've been working on trying to repair a robot. <br>
EMH: Ah yes, the mechanical man. Kes told me about it. Fascinating. <br>
TORRES: He's about to die. <br>
EMH: Die? <br>
TORRES: Die, stop functioning, whatever, unless I can figure out a way
to sustain his main energy source. <br>
EMH: What kind of energy source are we talking about? <br>
TORRES: It's some sort of chromo-dynamic module powered by a tripolymer
plasma, but the plasma is contaminated. It's decaying. <br>
EMH: Hmm. Like diseased blood. <br>
TORRES: Right. It can't retain enough energy to keep the module
running. <br>
EMH: Have you considered a transfusion? <br>
TORRES: You mean replacing the plasma itself? Well, that was one of my
first ideas, but where do I get my hands on a polymer plasma composed
of elements I didn't even know existed twenty four hours ago? <br>
EMH: Aren't Voyager's engines powered by warp plasma? <br>
TORRES: It's, it's a very different substance. Too highly charged. It
would burn out the robot's systems in seconds. It would be like trying
to give a Bolian a blood transfusion from a Vulcan. <br>
EMH: Which ordinarily would kill the unfortunate Bolian, but there have
been instances when artificial blood was unavailable and existing blood
cells were genetically altered for inter-species transfusions. <br>
TORRES: It's a good idea, but warp plasma radiates at too high a
frequency to alter electrochemically. Unless. <br>
EMH: Go on. <br>
TORRES: I could modify a series of anodyne relays, attach them directly
to the robots power module. They could act as a sort of regulator to
make the warp plasma compatible with the robot's energy matrix. <br>
(Torres leaves.) <br>
EMH: That's exactly what I was going to suggest. </be></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
That's the last of the relays. <br>
KIM: Plasma injector is sealed. <br>
JANEWAY: This is your show, Lieutenant. Whenever you're ready. <br>
TORRES: Activating the relays. All right, Harry, start the infusion.
Twenty percent nominal flow. <br>
KIM: Initiating plasma flow. <br>
TORRES: Energy levels are up fourteen percent. <br>
JANEWAY: The relays are holding. <br>
TORRES: Harry, give it a little more juice. <br>
KIM: Got it. I'm taking it to thirty percent. Thirty five percent. <br>
TORRES: Wait, the energy levels are rising too fast. We're going to
burn out it's systems. <br>
KIM: But it needs more plasma. <br>
JANEWAY: What about increasing the capacitance of the relays? <br>
TORRES: Let's give it a try. It's stabilising. Hold the flow right
there. Let's see what happens. The plasma is circulating. The
programming centre is activated. I think we may have done it. <br>
(The robot takes hold of Torres' arm.) <br>
3947: Please identify yourself. <br>
TORRES: I'm Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres of the Federation Starship
Voyager. <br>
3947: I'm automated unit 3947. Thank you for reactivating me,
Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> Chief
Engineer's log, supplemental. the robot's power module is continuing to
function normally using plasma from our warp engines. Repairing it's

at Starfleet Academy. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
I think we're past the critical stage. <br>
3947: I concur. According to my self-diagnostic systems Automated
Personnel Unit 3947 is currently functioning at sixty eight percent of
peak operating capabilities. <br>
TORRES: Automated Personnel Unit 3947 is an extremely well designed
machine. <br>
3947: Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres is an extremely proficient humanoid. <br>
TORRES: So how did you end up floating in space so badly damaged? <br>
3947: I was operating an asteroid mining pod. It exploded. <br>
TORRES: Do you know what caused the explosion? <br>
3947: I am unable to access that information. My memory cells are not
yet operating at optimal efficiency. <br>
TORRES: Do you remember where you come from? <br>
3947: I am stationed aboard a Pralor vessel. <br>
TORRES: Well, we'll do our best to find your ship and return you to
your people. <br>
3947: Thank you. <br>
TORRES: I'm hoping that the memory loss is only temporary. Once the new
plasma has the chance to fully integrate into your systems, I think
you'll be pretty close to optimal. <br>
3947: New plasma? <br>
TORRES: Yes, I adapted your module to accept our warp plasma as an
energy source. <br>
3947: You repaired my power module. Are you a Builder? <br>
TORRES: A builder? Well, I guess you could say that. I'm an engineer.
I'm responsible for repairing and maintaining all the systems on the
ship. <br>
3947: Only the Builders were capable of constructing or repairing power
modules. <br>
TORRES: The Builders are the people who created you? <br>
3947: Yes. <br>
TORRES: And they're humanoids like me? <br>
3947: Yes, like Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres. You could create a new
power module. <br>
TORRES: You don't need a new module. The one I just fixed will work
fine now. <br>
3947: The new power module would not be for me. It would be a prototype
for the construction of additional automated units. <br>
TORRES: Can't the Builders make additional units? <br>
3947: The Builders no longer exist. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Ready
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
Apparently thousands of them were built as service modules, but the
race who created them, these Builders, were killed off decades ago in a
war. <br>
JANEWAY: Leaving the automated units to fend for themselves. <br>
TORRES: Now they're wearing out, breaking down. They've learnt to make
repairs to themselves, some pretty complex, but the construction of a
power module, the device that sustains them, is beyond their grasp.
It's an incredible challenge, Captain, but with enough time to study
their systems, I might be able to do it. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't doubt your abilities, B'Elanna, but helping them
reproduce is a clear violation of the Prime Directive. <br>
TORRES: They've expressed a desire to procreate. That's basic to any
life form. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm not saying they don't have the same rights as any organic
species. That's not the issue here. <br>
TORRES: Are you sure? Suppose they were organic but they had become
sterile, and we had a treatment that would enable them to start
reproducing again. Would you withhold that treatment? <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe. I'd have to know more about the circumstances. But
we're not talking about treating a disorder here, are we? <br>
TORRES: What's the difference? <br>
JANEWAY: Unlike a species whose become sterile, the robots never had
the ability to reproduce. What you're talking about is giving them new
abilities, which is the equivalent of altering their genetic structure.
<br>
TORRES: To correct a flaw. <br>
JANEWAY: You can't call it a flaw. This is the way they were designed. <br>
TORRES: I'm trying to save them from extinction. <br>
JANEWAY: Unfortunately extinction is often the natural end of
evolution. <br>
TORRES: So you're just willing to let their entire society die off. <br>
JANEWAY: We don't know that's going to happen. If they're adaptable, as
you say, and capable of educating themselves, they might very well
learn to build a power module themselves some day. <br>
TORRES: Some day could be too late. There are only a few hundred of
them left. <br>
JANEWAY: I feel for the robot's plight, but what you are proposing is
exactly the kind of tampering the Prime Directive prohibits. We know
almost nothing about these creatures or the race that built them. What
would be the consequences of increasing their population, both to their
own civilisation and others in this quadrant? Who are we to swoop in,
play God and then continue on our way without the slightest
consideration of the long term effects of our actions? <br>
TORRES: Captain! <br>
JANEWAY: B'Elanna, I share your scientific curiosity and I admire your
compassion, but the answer is no. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> 3947: I
do not concur with your Captain's decision. <br>
TORRES: She's following our Prime Directive. <br>
3947: Define Prime Directive. <br>
TORRES: It forbids us to interfere in the natural development of other
cultures. <br>
3947: The automated units were not created naturally. We were built.
You can help us build more. <br>
TORRES: Captain Janeway doesn't think that's a good idea. <br>
3947: But Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres does. <br>
TORRES: Maybe. I don't know. I'd like to try, but I can't. <br>
3947: Without your help, we will not survive. I thought Lieutenant
B'Elanna Torres was a Builder. <br>

TORRES: What was the problem? <br>
3947: I am unable to explain the failure. We duplicated a power module
to exact specifications on several occasions, but in all instances the
energy output of the new module was insufficient to operate a unit. <br>
TORRES: And you're sure you reproduced the module exactly? <br>
3947: This is a schematic of a power module from a terminated unit.
This one is from a failed prototype. They are identical. There is no
reason why one should function while the does not. <br>
(Unit 6263 enters.) <br>
6263: Unit 3947, what can you report? <br>
TORRES: Well, let's see. We've been working for about five minutes so I
guess we don't have a lot of progress to report. <br>
6263: Our sensors indicate that the humanoid vessel will require
approximately one hundred and forty hours to repair. It is necessary
for you to complete work on the prototype before that time. <br>
TORRES: Why? We don't seem to be any match for you. <br>
6263: Our tactical subprocessors indicate a seventy nine percent
likelihood that rescue will be attempted when sufficient repairs are
completed. At optimal efficiency your engines are more powerful than
ours. <br>
3947: It is also possible that these humanoids will not make decisions
based on tactical probabilities. Their cognitive process is
unpredictable. <br>
6263: We will remain on full tactical alert. The humanoid may
purposefully attempt to delay completion of the prototype hoping she
will be rescued. <br>
TORRES: I don't know if a promise means anything to you people but it
does to us. I gave you my word that I'd do my best, and I will. <br>
3947: According to my observations, the humanoid is operating at
optimal efficiency. <br>
TORRES: Thank you. But I have to tell you there are no guarantees here.
Building a prototype from scratch is a lot different than repairing a
broken power module. I don't even know if it's possible. <br>
6263: If you fail, you and your people will die. <br>
(Unit 6263 leaves.) <br>
3947: B'Elanna Torres, 6263 is a Designated Command Unit. He is merely
following his programming. <br>
TORRES: I don't need to be threatened. I told you I'd do my best. <br>
3947: I believe you, but unit 6263 does not. He does not know
Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres as I do. <br>
TORRES: Let me see one of those terminated power modules. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Briefing

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
We've managed to repair the hull breach but we have no power on decks
three through seven. <br>
TUVOK: Aft shields are still completely non-functional. <br>
KIM: And last but not least, the dilithium matrix is destabilised, so
we can't get the warp engines running. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We're talking about at least another six days of repairs. <br>
JANEWAY: We're not sticking around that long. I want a plan to get
B'Elanna off that ship before she has a chance to finish building the
prototype. <br>
TUVOK: In that case I suggest we make warp drive our priority. Any
rescue attempt will no doubt necessitate a rapid departure. <br>
JANEWAY: Agreed. Mister Kim, can you give me an estimate on repairing
the dilithium matrix? <br>
KIM: How does seventy two hours sound? <br>
JANEWAY: Like twenty four hours too long. Dismissed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Pralor

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
Hand me the sub-micron scanner. Phase coil resonator. Well, I think I
know why your other prototypes failed, but I'm not sure I know what to
do about it yet. <br>
3947: Explain. <br>
TORRES: The automated units are modular. Your parts are identical,
interchangeable, right? <br>
3947: That is correct. <br>
TORRES: So if you lose an arm you can replace it with another one, and
over the years you've learnt to make new arms because they're all the
same and your programming is sophisticated enough to allow you to
reproduce what you see. But each power module has a slightly different
energy signature, so even if you copy this guy's module exactly it
wouldn't work in any other unit. As far as I can tell, every automated
unit has a power module with a unique energy code. <br>
3947: Can you reprogram the energy codes to make the modules
interchangeable? <br>
TORRES: I don't think so. <br>
3947: You have failed. I will inform 6263. <br>
TORRES: Hey, do all you automated units give up the minute you hit a
bump in the road? <br>
3947: You have an alternative idea? <br>
TORRES: What we've got to do is design a standardised module with a
uniform energy code that can power any unit. <br>
3947: According to my observations, there is now sufficient reason for
greater optimism. <br>
TORRES: You took the words right out of my mouth. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
Due to the complexity of their defence field and our severe power
shortage, it is unlikely that we can modify the transporters to beam
Lieutenant Torres out. <br>
CHAKOTAY: But if we can manoeuvre inside the field <br>
KIM: Our transporters could get the job done. <br>
JANEWAY: Is that a viable option? <br>
PARIS: For a shuttlecraft, it may be. <br>
JANEWAY: They were able to knock out Voyager's shields in a matter of
minutes. A shuttle would be even more vulnerable. <br>
TUVOK: It would be advisable to create a diversion of some sort to take
their attention away from the shuttle. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Attack them again? <br>
JANEWAY: I don't want to risk that a second time. <br>
PARIS: I don't need a diversion. Just give me a chance, I'll get her
out of there. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You don't mind if the rest of us give you a little help, do
you, Paris? I'd hate to lose another shuttle. <br>
PARIS: Your concern for my welfare is heartwarming. <br>
JANEWAY: In another twelve hours our warp engines will be back online.
I'd like to come up with a diversion before then. Okay, gentlemen? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
So far so good. I'm not getting any feedback from the motor circuits.
Are you going to be the obstetrician of this unit, 3947? <br>
3947: Please rephrase the question. <br>
TORRES: If this works, will you be in charge of assembling the new
units? <br>
3947: I am programmed as a ship's maintenance unit. I have no knowledge
of design, nor do any of the other automated personnel. <br>
TORRES: Sounds like you just volunteered for new duty. I hope you're
watching closely. <br>
3947: I am observing your work. However I do not possess your
improvisational capabilities. <br>
TORRES: Well, once we have the prototype, all you'd have to do is copy
it. Tell me something, thirty nine. Can I call you thirty nine? <br>
3947: I am automated unit 3947. <br>
TORRES: Fine. 3947. Did you wake up on a bench like this one? How long
have you been alive? <br>
3947: I have been in service one million three hundred and fourteen
thousand eight hundred and seven hours and thirty three minutes. I was
activated by a Builder from the Pralor homeworld. <br>
TORRES: Tell me something more about these Builders. Were they anything
like us? <br>
3947: I have insufficient knowledge of your culture to provide an
adequate response. Will you provide additional information? <br>
TORRES: Well. I asked about your culture, only fair you should ask
about mine. <br>
3947: Does your culture include artificial lifeforms? <br>
TORRES: As a matter of fact, it does. <br>
3947: Are they similar to the automated personnel units aboard this
ship? <br>
TORRES: Well, they come different shapes, and sizes. Some have limbs,
some don't. Most don't have your cognitive abilities. <br>
3947: Are they your servants? <br>
TORRES: I guess, you could say that the robots we use are servants in a
manner of speaking. But they aren't sentient like you. In fact, we have
only one sentient artificial life form in our society, and he is
treated the same as any human. <br>
3947: The same? He is equal to a Builder? <br>
TORRES: That's right. He works on a ship just like you or I. He wears
the same uniform I do. <br>
3947: What is his designated number? <br>
TORRES: He has a name like the rest of us. Data. <br>
3947: Data. I would like to be acquainted with this Data. <br>
TORRES: Ah, looks like this standardised power module is working pretty
well so far. <br>
3947: You will succeed, B'Elanna Torres. <br>
TORRES: Don't send me flowers yet. I've still got to see whether it
will power an actual unit. <br>

CHAKOTAY: We're making progress on the dilithium matrix. It should be
stable enough to reinitialise the warp core in about six hours. <br>
JANEWAY: Good. What about our diversion. Any suggestions? <br>
CHAKOTAY: When we were in the Maquis, B'Elanna once linked a
holo-emitter to a deflector array and projected an image of another
ship into space. <br>
JANEWAY: I like it. But do we have enough power? <br>
