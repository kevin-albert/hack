SISKO: Hey, Jake. What's all this? <br>
JAKE: My science project. I'm growing Bajoran katterpods to find out
which hybrid yields the biggest root. <br>
SISKO: That's it? You're just going to watch it grow? <br>
JAKE: Yeah. Pretty neat, huh? <br>
SISKO: Not bad, but don't you think it's a little Low tech? <br>
JAKE: I'm a low tech kind of guy, Dad. <br>
SISKO: I still think you can do something a little more challenging. If
you could do any science project you wanted to, anything at all, what
would it be? <br>
JAKE: Learn how to pilot a runabout? <br>
SISKO: Well, that's not exactly a science project, is it? Second
choice? <br>
JAKE: Visit the Gamma Quadrant? <br>
SISKO: And what would you do when you got there? <br>
JAKE: I don't know. I could do a planetary survey? <br>
SISKO: Not bad. All right, let's do it. <br>
JAKE: Really? <br>
SISKO: It'll be like a vacation. A working vacation. <br>
JAKE: That's great! Thanks, Dad. I bet we'll have a great time. <br>
SISKO: I know we will.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: Let's see. We have a Bolian freighter due in
day after tomorrow. We'll be outfitting another group of settlers
leaving for New Bajor. You know, I heard their new irrigation system is
really something to see. When you get to the Gamma Quadrant, you ought
to take a look. <br>
SISKO: Not this trip. I really want to spend some time alone with Jake.
When's the Odyssey due back from the Cardassian border? <br>
KIRA: Three days. <br>
SISKO: It's a shame I'll have to miss your reunion with Captain Keogh. <br>
DAX: Don't you find him just a little arrogant? <br>
SISKO: Funny, he said the same thing about you. <br>
DAX: Did he. <br>
O'BRIEN [OC]: Commander, your son's here to see you. <br>
SISKO: Send him in. He's really looking forward to this trip. <br>
(Jake enters) <br>
JAKE: Dad, guess what? I was talking to Nog and it turns out he's
having trouble coming up with a science project, so I told him he could
be my partner. <br>
KIRA: We can finish this up later. <br>
(Kira and Dax leave) <br>
SISKO: Partner? <br>
JAKE: We asked Mrs O'Brien and she said it would be okay, so I invited
Nog to come with us to the Gamma Quadrant. <br>
SISKO: Now hold on a second, Jake-o. <br>
JAKE: Dad, if Nog doesn't get a good grade on this science project,
he's going to drop out of school. And I can't let that happen. <br>
SISKO: Maybe he can help you analyse the survey information when we get
back? <br>
JAKE: That's not enough. Mrs O'Brien said he'd have to be an equal
partner. Come on, Dad. He's my friend. I have to help him.

staring at the same drink. Talk to me. I want to help. I'm not just
your bartender, I'm your friend. Whatever's wrong, I'm here for you. <br>
(Just before Morn can speak, Odo walks past.) <br>
QUARK: Hold that thought. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUARK: Well? What did he say? <br>
ODO: What did who say? <br>
QUARK: Commander Sisko. About my idea. <br>
ODO: You mean using the monitors throughout the station to sell
merchandise? <br>
QUARK: Stop torturing me, Odo. Tell me what he said. <br>
ODO: Guess. <br>
QUARK: He said yes. <br>
ODO: Guess again. <br>
QUARK: It would triple my profits. But how could he refuse? <br>
ODO: Maybe it's because he doesn't like you. <br>
QUARK: Don't be ridiculous. Major Kira's the one that doesn't like me.
Sisko <br>
ODO: Doesn't like you either. <br>
QUARK: What did I ever do to him? <br>
ODO: Oh, I could think of one or two things. <br>
QUARK: One or two things. That's nothing. So do you think there's any
way I can change his mind? <br>
ODO: Ha! <br>
(Odo walks off.) <br>
NOG: Uncle Quark? <br>
QUARK: Not now. <br>
NOG: I just wanted to tell you I'm not going to be able to work my
shift for the next couple of days. <br>
QUARK: Why not? <br>
NOG: I'm going to the Gamma Quadrant with Jake and his father. <br>
QUARK: You're going to the Gamma Quadrant with Commander Sisko. How
Lucky for you. <br>

runabout looked like. Hey, how do you fire the phasers? <br>
JAKE: Nog, you promised. <br>
NOG: I wasn't going to touch anything. <br>
SISKO: Why don't the two of you stow our gear in the back while I go
through pre-launch? <br>
NOG: I'll do it. <br>
(Nog grabs the bags and leaves) <br>
JAKE: I'll be right there. <br>
SISKO: Fire the phasers? <br>
JAKE: He was kidding. Look, Dad. I know this isn't exactly the trip you
planned on, but you'll see Nog's a great guy. <br>
SISKO: I'm sure he is. I was just hoping that you and I could spend
this time together. <br>
JAKE: We will. Don't worry. You won't even know Nog's along. This'll be
a great trip, you'll see. <br>
QUARK: Ah, there you are. Where do I put my bags? <br>
NOG: Uncle Quark, what are you doing here? <br>
QUARK: What does it look like? I'm going with you. <br>
SISKO: Since when? <br>
QUARK: Really, Commander. You don't expect my nephew to go all the way
to the Gamma Quadrant without proper supervision? No offence. Some of
my best friends are humans. But my brother Rom isn't as liberal as I
am. Let's face it, he's never been comfortable about Nog's friendship
with your son. <br>
SISKO: You can tell Rom not to worry. I'll take good care of the boy.
And I promise I won't try to corrupt him with my human values. <br>
QUARK: I know that, but Rom is convinced all humans look down on
Ferengi, and by allowing me to come on this trip you can help prove him
wrong. He is wrong, isn't he? <br>
JAKE: Dad, please. <br>
SISKO: All right. But let's get going before anyone else shows up. <br>
JAKE: Thanks, Dad. Thanks.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(WHOOSH and over to a lush green Gamma quadrant
planet for our group to go hiking on.) <br>
JAKE: This place is great. <br>
SISKO: Our preliminary surveys suggest it's a lot like Earth during the
early Devonian period. A lot of plant life, fish, some insects, but no
predators or large animals. Pretty, isn't it? <br>
QUARK: I don't see what's so pretty about it. <br>
NOG: I think they mean the trees and stuff. <br>
SISKO: Quark, this is as close to paradise as you're going to get. All
you need to do is allow yourself to see it. <br>
QUARK: I can tell you what I see in two words. Exploitable resources. <br>
SISKO: I suppose you want to cut down all these trees and start strip
mining the entire planet. <br>
QUARK: As a wise man once wrote, 'Nature decays, but latinum lasts
forever.' <br>
(Quark scratches behind his ear) <br>
NOG: Rule of Acquisition number one oh two. <br>
QUARK: Good lad. Nog, I have some ointment in one of my bags. Get it. <br>
SISKO: What's the problem? <br>
QUARK: Oh, I get a mild reaction now and then. <br>
SISKO: To what? <br>
QUARK: Nature. <br>
SISKO: Perhaps you'd be more comfortable sleeping on the runabout. <br>
QUARK: And miss all the fun? Never. Besides, I'm really looking forward
to our getting to know each other better. <br>
(Sisko gazes to heaven, then walks on) <br>
(Further on, they are resting by a tree and lots of flowers as Quark
paints bright aqua ointment on his lobes.) <br>
QUARK: Ahh, that's much better. Now, if it only wasn't so hot. <br>
SISKO: I hadn't noticed. <br>
QUARK: It isn't the heat so much as the humidity and the insects, the
stench of these flowers. I'm glad we could talk like this. There's
nothing like facing the wilderness to bring people closer. <br>
SISKO: The answer is still no, Quark. <br>
QUARK: No? No to what? <br>
SISKO: I'm not going to allow you to sell merchandise over the
station's monitors. <br>
QUARK: Why not? It's a brilliant idea. With my connections, I could
offer a whole range of merchandise which normally couldn't be acquired
in this sector. <br>
SISKO: Such as? <br>
QUARK: Collectibles. Andorian jewellry, Vulcan IDIC pins, Bolian
crystalsteel. And with my low overhead, I could offer these items at a
significant discount. <br>
SISKO: Quark, you're wasting your time, and mine. <br>
QUARK: Did I mention I was going to donate two percent of my net
profits to the Bajoran Fund for Orphans? Three percent? <br>
(Sisko walks over to the boys and their tricorder.) <br>
SISKO: So how's it going? <br>
JAKE: The atmosphere's seventy seven percent nitrogen, twenty one
percent oxygen, and two percent carbon dioxide. The water contains
traces of copper, nickel and a little birythium. <br>
SISKO: You're showing a little lead there too. <br>
JAKE: It's from the surrounding soil, but we think it's localised. <br>
NOG: We're going to check other water sources just to be sure. <br>
SISKO: Why not wait until tomorrow. I was just about to start dinner. <br>
JAKE: Jumbalaya? <br>
SISKO: How'd you know? <br>
JAKE: Great. <br>
NOG: Jumbowhat? <br>
JAKE: You're going to love it. <br>
SISKO: The two of you did good work today. <br>
NOG: Yes! </font></p>

the fire crackles) <br>
SISKO: Anyone want some more? <br>
JAKE: Not me. <br>
NOG: Me neither, Commander, but it was very good. You know, I think I'm
developing a taste for human food. <br>
SISKO: Quark? <br>
QUARK: I still say there's some dirt in the sauce. And these bugs. Look
at this. They get into everything. It's disgusting. <br>
SISKO: I thought the Ferengis liked eating bugs. <br>
QUARK: Only certain bugs. Ferengi bugs. Nog, get some more ointment for
the back of my neck. <br>
NOG: Yes, Uncle. <br>
SISKO: Better get a good night's sleep. We have another big day
tomorrow. <br>
JAKE: Yeah, I want to start cataloguing the plant life first thing in
the morning. You know what this reminds me of? <br>
SISKO: A camping trip we took on Itamish Three. <br>
JAKE: I don't think I remember you, me, and Mom ever having more fun
together. <br>
SISKO: Isn't that where I taught you how to water ski? <br>
JAKE: Mom taught me how to water ski. <br>
SISKO: Yes. She was always the graceful one. You know, Jake, we really
need to get away more often. <br>
JAKE: I'm ready whenever you are. I'm sure Nog is too. I'm joking. <br>
(Quark screams) <br>
QUARK: I'm on fire! I'm on fire! <br>
(He is leaping about with his right cuff ablaze. Sisko wraps a blanket
over it.) <br>
SISKO: Quark, cover it up! Are you all right? <br>
QUARK: No, I'm not all right! My ears itch, my nose is running, I'm
eating foreign bugs. Now look at me. One minute I'm trying to pick out
a couple of bugs out of that jumbawhatsit pot, next thing I know,
whoosh! <br>
SISKO: Quark, calm down. Look, do us all a favour. Sit down and try to
stay out of trouble. <br>
QUARK: What did I do? <br>
(Nog hisses at Quark and runs off.) <br>
JAKE: I'd better go see if he's okay. <br>
(Jake follows Nog) <br>
QUARK: Now see what you've done. <br>
SISKO: What I've done? <br>
QUARK: The boy couldn't stand seeing his favourite Uncle insulted. I
guess Rom was right after all. You don't like Ferengis, do you? <br>
SISKO: That is not true. <br>
QUARK: All right, name me one Ferengi you do like. Ah ha. You see? I
was right. You Federation types are all alike. You talk about tolerance
and understanding but you only practice it toward people who remind you
of yourselves. Because you disapprove of Ferengi values, you scorn us,
distrust us, insult us every chance you get. <br>
SISKO: Quark, I don't have to stand here and defend myself. <br>
QUARK: Tell me, Commander, would you allow your son to marry a Ferengi
female? <br>
SISKO: I never thought about it. <br>
QUARK: Exactly my point. <br>
(An alien woman runs into the camp and summons an energy pulse from her
chest which knocks Sisko down.) <br>
QUARK: Don't hurt me. <br>
ERIS: How many of them are there? <br>
QUARK: There's just the two of us. <br>
ERIS: Not you, the Jem'Hadar. <br>
SISKO: We don't know who you're talking about. We are not your enemies.
<br>
ERIS: Then you'd better run. <br>
(Six or seven soldiers shimmer into view from thin air.) <br>
TALAK'TALAN: It's too late. You're done running. <br>
QUARK: This has not been a good day. <br>
(Later, Nog and Jake return to the deserted camp and smoking fire. Jake
uses his comm. badge.) <br>
JAKE: Dad, this is Jake. Where are you? Dad, answer me. <br>
NOG: I'm telling you, Jake, something's happened to them. Maybe they
were attacked by a wild animal. <br>
JAKE: You heard my Dad. There aren't any wild animals, just insects and
plants. <br>
NOG: Maybe they were attacked by a vicious tree? <br>
JAKE: Take a look at this. <br>
(Footprints) <br>
JAKE: I don't know any trees that wear boots. <br>
NOG: We'd better beam up to the runabout. <br>
JAKE: Listen, we can't run away just 'cos we're scared. <br>
NOG: Hey, who said anything about being scared? I just thought the
runabout would be a good place to er, to plan our next move. <br>
JAKE: There's nothing to plan. My Dad never would've left here without
telling me first, not unless he was in some sort of trouble. We can
track them with the tricorder. <br>
NOG: Hey! Wait for me.

QUARK: Hey! Is anybody there? Hello! We're humanoids! We require food
and water. Hello? <br>
SISKO: Quark, shut up. <br>
QUARK: (to Eris) This is your fault. They were after you, not us. Why
don't you say something to them? Tell them you've never seen us before.
We have nothing to do with her! This is a misunderstanding! <br>
SISKO: Quark. <br>
QUARK: I have the right to express my opinion. <br>
SISKO: I'm about to put my fist in your opinion. <br>
QUARK: You don't scare me. And you want to know why you don't scare me?
Because I'm already more scared than I've ever been in my life. <br>
SISKO: You're not helping anything. <br>
QUARK: I'm not helping anything? I don't see you coming up with any
ideas. Or her. <br>
SISKO: If she wants to help us, she will. Right now, I'd say she's even
more scared than you are. <br>
QUARK: Believe me, she's not. <br>
SISKO: She's obviously been running from these people for a while.
She's probably been through a lot. She doesn't know who we are, what
we're about. I just hope that Jake and Nog are smart enough to stay out
of sight until help gets here. <br>
QUARK: Trust me, I didn't raise my nephew to be a fool. He'll find the
nearest dark hole and climb into it. <br>
SISKO: I'm not so sure about Jake. If I know him, he'll be looking for
us. <br>
QUARK: Don't they teach you how to neutralise security fields in
Starfleet? <br>
SISKO: I've never seen anything like this before. It seems like it's
generated by <br>
ERIS: Don't. The security barrier will kill you. <br>
SISKO: Thanks for the warning. <br>
ERIS: I have no wish to see you hurt. <br>
QUARK: A lovely sentiment. <br>
SISKO: How did you know that the security barrier's lethal? <br>
ERIS: Because everything about the Jem'Hadar is lethal. <br>
SISKO: Anything you can tell me about them might be helpful. <br>
ERIS: Are you saying you've never heard of the Jem'Hadar? <br>
SISKO: We're not from around here. My name is Benjamin Sisko. I'm from
the United Federation of Planets. We came through a wormhole to get
here. Our home is thousands of light years away. <br>
ERIS: My name is Eris. <br>
SISKO: I'm glad to meet you, Eris. <br>
(Sisko holds out his hand and introduces Eris to the handshake.) <br>
SISKO: That's Quark. Tell me about the Jem'Hadar. <br>
ERIS: They're the most feared soldiers in the Dominion. <br>
QUARK: The Dominion? The Ferengi have been trying to open up trade
negotiations with the Dominion for almost a year now. We've never heard
of the Jem'Hadar. <br>
ERIS: Then you've been fortunate. Negotiations with the Dominion can be
a dangerous thing. <br>
SISKO: If it's so dangerous, why would anyone do business with them? <br>
ERIS: The Dominion decides that you have something that they want and
then they come and take it by negotiation or by force. Believe me, I
know. I've seen it happen on my own world. Kurill Prime was offered
entry into the Dominion. They thought our telekinetic powers would be
useful to them. <br>
SISKO: Back there in the camp, that's what you used to knock me down. <br>
ERIS: When Kurill refused the Dominion's offer, they sent in the
Jem'Hadar. They destroyed our communications centre, they executed our
leaders, and before we realised it, they had seized control of the
entire planet. <br>
SISKO: How did you manage to escape? <br>
ERIS: I was on a freighter returning home when the attack occurred. We
fled, but they came after us. <br>
SISKO: Why? <br>
ERIS: My mother was an outspoken opponent of the Dominion. I guess they
wanted to make an example of my family. <br>
SISKO: That thing they put around your neck <br>
ERIS: It suppresses my telekinetic abilities. Without it, I might be
able to break through the security barrier. <br>
SISKO: Then we'll just have to find a way to get this collar off. <br>
ERIS: Even if we do get past the barrier, no one ever escapes from the
Jem'Hadar. <br>
SISKO: Luckily for us, they seem as sure about that as you do. Look
around you. They've placed the three of us in the same containment
field. I've never seen more than four guards on duty at any one time.
As far as I can tell, there's only this single containment field
between us and freedom. They're overconfident, and that's what's going
to help us get out of here. Maybe if I can pry off that casing, I can
get at the locking mechanism. (her brooch) May I? <br>
ERIS: Of course.

TALAK'TALAN: That's not my concern. <br>
SISKO: Then why won't you let us go? <br>

them. <br>
TALAK'TALAN: Those aren't my orders. <br>
ERIS: He can't take you to the Founders because they don't exist.
They're a myth. <br>
TALAK'TALAN: The Founders exist. They created the Dominion. <br>
SISKO: And the Jem'Hadar are their servants? <br>
TALAK'TALAN: A Ferengi and a human. I was hoping the first race I'd
meet from the other side of the anomaly would be the Klingons. <br>
SISKO: I'm sorry to disappoint you. <br>
TALAK'TALAN: It's too late for apologies. The Dominion will no longer
stand by and allow ships from your side to violate our territory. I
hear that Klingons are effective warriors. What's that weapon they're
so fond of? The bat'leth? <br>
SISKO: I am not interested in discussing the Klingons. <br>
TALAK'TALAN: All right. Then what about the Cardassians? Are you
satisfied with the treaty your Federation made with them? It seems a
tactical error. <br>
SISKO: How do you know so much about our side of the galaxy? <br>
TALAK'TALAN: We gain more knowledge every day, and now we have you to

and beam them up. <br>

distortion field. <br>

wormhole. <br>

escape pods! <br>

five nine. <br>
