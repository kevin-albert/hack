ROM: All right, everyone. Gather around. We're about to start. When a
young Ferengi goes out on his own, he traditionally raises capital by
selling his boyhood treasures. As you know, my son Nog will be leaving
shortly for Earth and Starfleet Academy. I'm going to miss him, and I
know you will too. And what better way to remember him than to purchase
one of his very own personal belongings? I don't know about you, but
I'm buying these pajamas. <br>
NOG: That'll be three strips of latinum. <br>
ROM: Two. <br>
NOG: Sold. Let the buying commence. No reasonable offer will be
refused. <br>
O'BRIEN: I didn't expect to see you here, Mister Worf. <br>
WORF: Captain Sisko made it a personal request that I attend. He seems
to have taken some interest in the young Ferengi. <br>
O'BRIEN: The Captain sponsored Nog's application to the Academy. <br>
WORF: A Ferengi at the Academy? I am not sure that is wise. <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh, I don't know about that. Not so long ago someone might
have said the same thing about you. <br>
SISKO: You two'd better hurry or there won't be anything left to buy. <br>
BASHIR: Nog, what is this? <br>
NOG: My favourite holosuite programme. A Visit with the Pleasure
Goddess of Rixx. Yours for a mere ten strips of latinum. <br>
DAX: He'll take it. Consider it a gift. <br>
BASHIR: You're too kind. <br>
KIRA: Nog, where did you get this springball racket? <br>
NOG: Out of a replicator? <br>
KIRA: Try out of my quarters. This is mine. I've been looking for it
for two years. <br>
NOG: And it was sitting here on the bar all along. That's incredible. <br>
JAKE: It's a Ferengi tooth sharpener. <br>
(Worf tries it) <br>
WORF: How much? <br>
QUARK: Rom. <br>
ROM: Brother, you're here. If you hurry, there still might be some
choice items left for you to buy. <br>
QUARK: I'm not here for the sale. Nog has no business going to
Starfleet Academy and I'm not doing anything to encourage him. Now,
come with me. <br>
ROM: But the sale <br>
QUARK: It's over as far as you're concerned. The ship. It's here. <br>
ROM: What ship? <br>
QUARK: The ship. Our ship. My ship. The shuttle cousin Gaila owed me. <br>
ROM: He's owed you that shuttle for ten years. <br>
QUARK: Ever since I loaned him the latinum to start up his munitions
consortium. He always said that if he became a success, he'd buy me my
own ship. Now it's here. <br>
ROM: But why do you need me? <br>
QUARK: Because knowing our cousin, it's probably defective merchandise.
<br>
ROM: I'd better have a look at it. <br>
QUARK: What a wonderful idea. Now get going. <br>

QUARK: And leave the clothes here.

ROM: Nothing. The ship is perfect. Gaila must've paid a fortune for it.
<br>
QUARK: You mean it'll actually fly? <br>
ROM: This ship could outrun a Romulan interceptor. We could take it
halfway across the galaxy before it would even need a maintenance
check. <br>
QUARK: You don't say? And it's all mine. I can go any place I want. <br>
ROM: Maybe it's time you considered that early retirement we talked
about. I could take over the bar, and you could fly off into the great
unknown never to return. Unless you wanted to. <br>
QUARK: Don't get your hopes up. The first thing we need to do is take
this thing for a test flight. Someplace reasonably far away, but safe.
Someplace like <br>

QUARK: Exactly. If the boy wants to go to Starfleet Academy, he might
as well do it in style. <br>

Earth. This is going to be fun. <br>

don't extend any lines of credit, don't touch the dabo girls, and make

keeping his eyes on you. <br>
ODO: Good choice, Quark. I'm sure Morn'll do an excellent job, as long
as he doesn't drink up all your profits. <br>

JAKE: I wonder how many hours you and I spent hanging around up here. <br>
NOG: Two thousand, one hundred and forty seven. Just kidding. But it
was a lot. <br>
JAKE: You know, aside from playing dom-jot and watching the Bajoran
transports dock, it seems like we spent most of our time doing nothing.
<br>
NOG: Maybe so, but I can't think of anyone I'd rather do nothing with
than you. <br>
JAKE: Same here. <br>
BASHIR: Nog. <br>
(Bashir is holding a packet) <br>
NOG: Doctor, if you're trying to return something from the sale <br>
O'BRIEN: It's a going-away present. <br>
BASHIR: To help you get around easier on Earth. <br>
(It's a PADD - visitor's guide to sector 001 - Earth) <br>
NOG: A guidebook? <br>
O'BRIEN: It's not just a guidebook. It's a completely interactive
program detailing Earth's customs, culture, history, geography. <br>
BASHIR: Everything you ever wanted to know about Earth is right in that
PADD. <br>
NOG: You mean it'll teach me how to attract human females? <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, almost everything. <br>
NOG: I'm sure it'll come in handy. Thank you. Well, I'd better get
going. My father and Uncle Quark are waiting for me. <br>
O'BRIEN: Good luck, Nog. <br>

currency until five thousand years ago. Let alone banking, speculative
investments or a unified global economy. <br>
QUARK: They're a primitive, backward people, Nog. Pity them. <br>
NOG: But think about it, uncle. That means they went from being savages
with a simple barter system to leaders of a vast interstellar
Federation in only five thousand years It took us twice as long to
establish the Ferengi Alliance, and we had to buy warp technology from
the <br>
QUARK: Five thousand, ten thousand, what's the difference? The speed of
technological advancement isn't nearly as important as short-term
quarterly gains. Can't this thing go any faster? <br>
ROM: We're already exceeding the safe maximum cruising speed by two
tenths of a warp factor. <br>
QUARK: Push it another tenth. This trip is taking long enough as it is.
<br>
ROM: Relax, brother. I know kemacite is unstable, but another day or
two won't make any difference. <br>
QUARK: What are you talking about? <br>
ROM: The shipment of kemacite that you're smuggling in the cargo hold. <br>
NOG: Uncle, are you smuggling kemacite? Isn't that dangerous? <br>
ROM: Dangerous and highly profitable. Especially if we make a side trip
to Orion on the way home from Earth. <br>
QUARK: What tipped you off? <br>
ROM: When I engaged the impulse engines, I noticed the ship's weight
distribution was a little off. So the last time you went to waste
extraction, I snuck back to the cargo bay and took a look around. <br>
QUARK: When did you get so smart? <br>
ROM: I've always been smart, brother. I've just lacked self-confidence.
Of course, I could forget everything I saw. <br>
QUARK: How much? <br>
ROM: Twenty percent of the profits. <br>
QUARK: I suppose you'll want a cut too? <br>
NOG: As a Starfleet cadet, it's my duty to report any violation of
Federation law to my superiors immediately. But then again, I haven't
been sworn in yet. I'll take ten percent. <br>
QUARK: It's a deal. I thought I told you to go faster. <br>
ROM: Faster it is. <br>
(Later) <br>
ROM: Brother, wake up. We're approaching Earth's star system. <br>
QUARK: Take her out of warp. <br>
NOG: Father, have you ever heard of the <a href="458.htm" target="_blank"> Bell
Riots</a>? <br>
ROM: Don't bother me now. <br>
NOG: But doesn't this Gabriel Bell human look just like Captain Sisko? <br>
QUARK: All humans look alike. thought I told you to take us out of
warp. <br>
ROM: I'm trying, brother, but the warp core isn't responding. It looks
like the command sequencer has been disabled. I don't understand. I
tested everything. The only way this could've happened is if the
command sequencer was designed to fail. <br>
NOG: You mean sabotage? <br>
QUARK: Cousin Gaila. <br>
NOG: He never did like you very much, Uncle. <br>
QUARK: Okay, okay. No need to panic. So the warp drive won't shut down.
What's the worst thing that could happen? <br>
ROM: The ship could continue accelerating until it tears itself apart
and scatters our remains halfway across the quadrant. <br>
QUARK: There must be something we can do? <br>
ROM: Jettison the warp core. No, I tried that already. Emergency
overrides are frozen. <br>
QUARK: Then we'll have to try something else, won't we? <br>
ROM: The kemacite! If we vent plasma from the warp core into the cargo
hold, we may be able to start a cascade reaction in the kemacite. Then
we can modulate the reaction to create an inversion wave in the warp
field and force the ship back into normal space! If I time it just
right, I should be able to get us close enough to Earth to make an
emergency landing. <br>
QUARK: Rom, you're a genius! <br>
ROM: You think so? <br>
QUARK: How should I know? I have no idea what you're talking about.
Just do it. <br>
ROM: Hold on. <br>

uniforms from my guidebook. They're from the twentieth century. <br>
ROM: The twentieth century? You mean we travelled back through time? <br>
NOG: More than four hundred years. Those are military uniforms from one
of the old nation states. Australia or something. <br>

banging their heads? <br>

no idea they were this stupid. <br>

selfish. <br>

QUARK: The three of us and millions of primitive humans. I like those
odds. <br>

Nurse Garland takes his blood pressure.) <br>

GARLAND: I've given them every medical test I can think of, but the
only thing I can tell you for sure is they're not human. <br>

kind of grooming ritual. Look how the older one is taking care of the
younger one. <br>
(Rom is checking in Nog's ear.) <br>
GARLAND: It's sweet. Maybe they're father and son? Wouldn't that be
something? They've come from so far away, but they still have the same
basic family structure that we do. <br>
CARLSON: I wonder if the third one's related too. <br>
GARLAND: For all we know, it could be the mother. <br>
QUARK: Gren fa hoe loth pex pil. <br>
CARLSON: If she is the mother, she's quite a shrew. <br>
ROM: I'm working as fast as I can, brother, but there must be some kind
of interference disrupting our translators. <br>
QUARK: What kind of interference? <br>
ROM: I'm not sure. Could be solar flares, or maybe ionic interference.
Or I suppose it could be beta radiation, but that's only produced by
nuclear fission. <br>
QUARK: Don't be an idiot. Nuclear fission doesn't happen within
planetary atmospheres. <br>
NOG: It does here. In the twentieth century humans used crude nuclear
reactors as weapons. They called them atom bombs. They used to blow
them up all the time. <br>
QUARK: They irradiated their own planet? <br>
ROM: If Nog says so, they did. He knows all about Earth history. <br>
QUARK: You'd better fix those translators fast. The sooner we start
talking to these savages, the better off we'll be. <br>
(Nurse Garland is replacing one of her hairpins.) <br>

in a few more experts. <br>
GARLAND: Let's face it, Jeff, when it comes to beings from another
planet, we don't have any experts. You'll find a way to communicate
with them, darling. I know you will. <br>
(Carlson lights two cigarettes and gives one to Garland.) <br>
GARLAND: Imagine the possibilities. Who knows what they could teach us.
A few years from now, mankind could have rocket ships of our own. We
could travel the galaxy, exploring new worlds and new civilisations. <br>

CARLSON: Always the dreamer. <br>
GARLAND: That's why you love me. <br>
CARLSON: It's funny, isn't it? Here we are in the middle of one of the
greatest discoveries in human history, and all I can think about is
what you're going to look like in your wedding dress. <br>
GARLAND: My mother keeps asking where we're going on our honeymoon. She
thinks we should go to Niagara Falls. <br>
CARLSON: Who knows? Maybe we'll go to Mars. <br>

QUARK: What is that disgusting smell? <br>
NOG: I think it's called tobacco. It's a deadly drug. When used
frequently, it destroys the internal organs. <br>
QUARK: If it's so deadly, then why do they use it? <br>
NOG: It's also highly addictive. <br>
ROM: How do they get their hands on it? <br>
NOG: They buy it in stores. <br>
QUARK: They buy it? If they'll buy poison, they'll buy anything. I
think I'm going to like it here. <br>
NOG: Uncle, I hope you're not thinking of doing anything that would
disrupt the timeline. <br>
QUARK: Perish the thought. <br>
NOG: Changing the history of Earth could effect the entire galaxy. The
Federation, Deep Space Nine, your bar could all cease to exist. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Denning is peering into Quark's ear.) <br>
DENNING: I don't see any universal translator. <br>
QUARK: Trust me, it's in there. <br>
DENNING: So this gadget of yours is what makes it possible for us to
understand each other? How's it work? <br>
QUARK: It's simple, if you know how. You'd be surprised at the kind of
things you can do with the right technology. Which brings me to why I'm
here. <br>
DENNING: I was wondering about that. <br>
QUARK: I've been sent by my people to open up a market for advanced
Ferengi technology. <br>
DENNING: What kind of technology you talking about? <br>
QUARK: How would you like to travel beyond the stars at speeds you
never even dreamt were possible? Or to transport yourselves from one
place to another in the blink of an eye? <br>
DENNING: You know how to do that? <br>
QUARK: That's only the beginning. We can give you the medical knowledge
to cure your deadliest diseases. We have machines that can produce food
and clothing out of thin air. <br>
DENNING: What about weapons? <br>
QUARK: Weapons? If you want weapons, I'm the man to see. We can teach
you to make phasers, disruptors, photon torpedoes or even quantum
torpedoes. A little more expensive, but worth it. <br>
DENNING: What do you want in return? <br>
QUARK: That depends. What do you use for currency around here? Latinum?
Dilithium? <br>
DENNING: We use dollars. <br>
QUARK: Dollars? Never heard of them. Don't you have any gemstones or
precious minerals? <br>
DENNING: You mean like gold? <br>
QUARK: Gold? Gold is good. <br>
DENNING: How much gold are we talking about? <br>
QUARK: Seeing how we're going to be advancing your culture about four
hundred years overnight, I'd say a couple of million bars would be
about right as a good faith deposit. <br>
DENNING: You know, Quark, you might be some kind of Martian <br>
QUARK: Ferengi. <br>
DENNING: Whatever. But the more we talk, the more you remind me of my
brother-in-law. <br>
QUARK: Is he a businessman? <br>
DENNING: He's a car salesman, and not a very good one. <br>
QUARK: Then he's nothing like me. <br>
DENNING: The bottom line is, I don't trust him and I don't trust you.
So before we sit down and sign any contracts, you are going to tell me
just what the hell you people are really doing here. <br>
QUARK: I just told you. We're here to open up trade negotiations. If
you're not interested, just say so. I'm sure I can do business with one
of your planet's other nation states. <br>
DENNING: In other words, if we don't play ball, you're going to sell
those advanced weapons of yours to the Russians. <br>
QUARK: I'd rather it didn't come to that. To be honest, I'd much rather
work with you Australians. <br>
DENNING: Americans. <br>
QUARK: Whatever. But if you won't do business with me, and the Russians
will, who am I to say no? <br>
DENNING: I'm not saying we can't do business, but I don't have the
authority to make this kind of decision. I'll have to er, well, I'll
have to get clearance from the President. <br>
QUARK: I can wait. (coughs on the cigar smoke) In the meantime, let me
give you some free advice, just to show I'm on your side. You people
should take better care of yourselves. Stop poisoning your bodies with
tobacco and atom bombs. Sooner or later, that kind of stuff will kill
you. <br>
DENNING: What do you know about atom bombs? <br>
QUARK: My people have been watching your world for years. We know all
about you. Baseball, root beer, darts, atom bombs. It's quite a
fascinating culture you humans have here. And with a little Ferengi
technology, it could be even better. Now, why don't you go talk to that
president of yours?

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Night time. Carlson and Garland are there, with
the alsatian lying on a table.) <br>
CARLSON: Let me get this straight, Rom. Are you saying that all the
women on your world walk around naked? <br>
ROM: It's the law. <br>
CARLSON: You don't say? <br>
GARLAND: Well I guess I'm never going to visit your world. And neither
are you. <br>
NOG: Nurse Garland, I'm having trouble with my ear again. Could you
massage it some more? <br>
GARLAND: Are you sure you don't want a doctor to look at that? <br>
NOG: No. I feel more comfortable with you. <br>
(So he gets some oo-mox.) <br>
NOG: Ah! Much better. <br>
ROM: You know, come to think of it, my ear's bothering me too. <br>
(Quark enters with MPs.) <br>
ROM: Brother, how did your meeting with the general go? <br>
(Quark nearly answers, then looks at Carlson.) <br>
CARLSON: It's late. We should let you get some rest. <br>
NOG: I'm not tired. <br>
GARLAND: We'll visit some more tomorrow. <br>
(Garland and Carlson leave with the MPs, but the dog stays.) <br>
QUARK: There's something about that female that I don't like. She's so
cheerful. <br>
ROM: What about the general? <br>
NOG: Is he going to let us leave? <br>
QUARK: Don't worry. Everything's under control. <br>
(The alsasian barks) <br>
QUARK: Oh. They forgot to take that thing with them. <br>
(The alsatian comes over to Quark and jumps up at him.) <br>
ROM: It seems to like you, brother. <br>
QUARK: Get away from me. <br>
(The dog morphs into) <br>
ODO: Hello, Quark. <br>
QUARK: Odo? What are you doing here? <br>
ODO: Placing you under arrest for attempting to smuggle kemacite. Did
you really expect me to believe that you were travelling all the way to
Earth just to be nice to your nephew? <br>
ROM: You hid on board the ship. <br>
ODO: That's right. And now I'm stuck here with you. Now listen
carefully, because we don't have much time. Someone could come in any
minute. Your ship is in a hangar on the other side of the base. It
sustained some damage in the crash, but the engines are still
functioning. If we're lucky, we should be able to use it to get away
from here. <br>
NOG: And go where? Even if we get out of here, we're still going be
trapped four hundred years in the past. <br>
ROM: Actually, I've been thinking. If there's enough kemacite left,
there might be a way to get back to our own time. <br>
ODO: How? <br>
ROM: If we find a sufficiently powerful energy source, we should be
able to trigger a temporal surge in the subspace continuum and recreate
the same kind of time warp that brought us here in the first place. <br>
ODO: What do you mean by a sufficiently powerful energy source? <br>
QUARK: We're not going anywhere. We're staying right here. <br>
ROM: But brother, what about the bar? <br>
QUARK: Who cares about the bar? I'm telling you, Rom, we stay here and
inside a year, we'll be running this place. <br>
ROM: You mean the military base? <br>
QUARK: I mean the whole planet. Harumph all you want. But these humans,
they're nothing like the ones from the Federation. They're crude,
gullible and greedy. <br>
ODO: You mean like you. <br>
QUARK: Yeah. These are humans I can understand and manipulate. <br>
NOG: But Uncle, what about the timeline? <br>
QUARK: Forget this timeline. The one we're going to create will be
better. Once we get things in order here, we'll contact the Ferengi
homeworld and sell them our ship. The Ferengi will have warp drive
technology centuries before humans or Klingons or even the Vulcans.
We'll establish an economic empire beyond even Grand Nagus Zek's
wildest dreams. And I'll control it all. <br>
ODO: You do have a vivid imagination. But the only place we're going is
back to our own time. I'll have the ship ready to go in six hours. And
you're all going to be on it. <br>
QUARK: I'm not going back, and neither is my ship. <br>
ODO: We'll see about that. <br>
(Odo morphs back into the dog.)

WAINWRIGHT: What's the word, General? <br>
DENNING: That little piano-playing Democrat's not as dumb as he looks.
He's not about to make a deal with these aliens until we learn more
about them. <br>
WAINWRIGHT: And how does the President propose we do that? <br>
DENNING: He said he'd leave that in our capable hands. <br>
WAINWRIGHT: Don't worry, General. I'll find out what those Martians are
up to. <br>
DENNING: See that you do.

QUARK: The riskier the road, the greater the profit. <br>
ROM: What about Rule of Acquisition two hundred and three? New
customers are like razor-toothed gree worms. They can be succulent, but
sometimes they bite back. <br>
QUARK: No. If there's any biting to be done, we're the one's who are
going to do it. <br>

QUARK: This is an outrage. I demand to see General Denning. If I don't
get satisfaction, I'm taking my business to the Russians. <br>
WAINWRIGHT: The Russians. That's a good place to start. Why don't you
tell me everything you know about the Russians? <br>
(Nurse Garland approaches with a loaded hypodermic syringe) <br>
(After the break, Quark is screaming) <br>
QUARK: Would you please stop doing that? <br>
GARLAND: That's the fifth injection of sodium pentathol I've given him.
It's not working. <br>
CARLSON: Their biochemistry is obviously nothing like ours. <br>
QUARK: Then stop sticking me with those needles! <br>
GARLAND: Captain, this is wrong. These people are our guests. <br>
WAINWRIGHT: They're not people, they're things. Invaders from another
world. And it's up to us to put an end to whatever they're planning.
Now, if you don't tell me what I want to know, needles are going to be
the least of your worries. You know, Doc, I've always wanted to see
what a Martian looked like from the inside. <br>
(Wainwright holds a scalpel to Quark's neck.) <br>
NOG: Don't you people have laws against this kind of thing? <br>
WAINWRIGHT: Not when it comes to National Security. Now, which one
should we start with. The loud one? The little one? Or the quiet one?
Now, why don't you tell us why you're really here? <br>
ROM: It was an accident. We're from the future. The warp core was
sabotaged. It's all Cousin Gaila's fault. I want to go home! I want my
Moogie. <br>
WAINWRIGHT: Moogie? <br>
NOG: You want the truth, I'll tell you the truth. We're advance scouts
for the Ferengi invasion fleet. <br>
WAINWRIGHT: I knew it. <br>
QUARK: Nog, what are you talking about? <br>
NOG: We've been studying you puny Earthlings for centuries and you're
ripe for conquest. <br>
QUARK: It's not true. <br>
ROM: Moogie! <br>
NOG: It's no use, Supreme Commander. They've seen through our cover.
But knowing our plans won't do them any good. Even now three hundred
Marauder-class attack cruisers are orbiting your planet preparing for
the attack. <br>
ROM: Moogie! <br>
QUARK: I'm telling you, this is crazy. Nog, tell him the truth. We're
helpless. We're harmless. We just want to sell you things. <br>
CARLSON: Captain, I'm not sure I believe this invasion story. <br>
WAINWRIGHT: You scientists, you're like children. Always walking around
with your heads in the clouds. Keep talking. <br>
NOG: When the appointed hour arrives, the Marauders will deactivate
their cloaking devices and begin transporting Klingon shock troops
directly to the landing zone. <br>
WAINWRIGHT: Landing zone? Where? Tell me. <br>
NOG: Why not? Your feeble weapons will be useless against us. We will
kill all your males, and take your females to mate with. <br>
WAINWRIGHT: Where's the landing zone? <br>
NOG: Untie me and I will show you on that map. <br>
WAINWRIGHT: (to MPs) You heard him. Go get General Denning. Tell him he
was right about the Martians all along. Now show me. <br>

WAINWRIGHT: Where? <br>
NOG: Here. Right by that blue blob. <br>
WAINWRIGHT: You mean your people are going to invade Cleveland? <br>
NOG: No, not Cleveland. Right here. <br>

weapon at Nog.) <br>
MP: Hold it! <br>
GARLAND: Don't hurt him. <br>
NOG: It was an accident. I tripped. I didn't mean to do it. I'm really,
really, sorry. <br>

metal tray.) <br>
