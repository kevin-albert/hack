O'BRIEN: Hey! Welcome! Well, I for one never doubted you'd be back. <br>
BASHIR: Neither did I. <br>
O'BRIEN: Don't believe him. He was Mister Doom and Gloom the entire
time you were gone. <br>
BASHIR: Well, I must admit I was a bit concerned. <br>
O'BRIEN: We were all concerned. Your well being was a constant source
of conversation and speculation. <br>
EZRI: You see, I told you they'd miss us. So, who won the betting pool?
<br>
BASHIR: Morn. He managed to guess the day when you'd be back. Only
missed the time of your arrival by two hours. <br>
O'BRIEN: He's amazing. <br>
BASHIR: I don't know how he does it. <br>
(Sisko joins them.) <br>
SISKO: Mister Worf. <br>
WORF: Captain. <br>
EZRI: I know what you're going to say, and the answer is yes, I did
leave the station without your permission, and yes, I lost a runabout,
but <br>
SISKO: We'll evaluate your actions later, old man. Right now I'd like
to know everything you've learned about this Breen Dominion alliance. <br>
WORF: I'm afraid we have very little information to share with you,
Captain. <br>
EZRI: Weyoun and the others were more interested in asking questions
than they were answering them. <br>
SISKO: Why do you think Damar decided to help you escape? <br>
EZRI: I'm not sure, but I can tell you one thing. He hates Weyoun. <br>
WORF: The Cardassians are a proud people, but the Dominion treats them
like second class citizens. <br>
EZRI: I think Damar is worried that this new alliance with the Breen is
going to weaken Cardassia's status with the Dominion even more. But
whatever his reasons, we owe him our lives. <br>
SISKO: Maybe one day you'll be able to return the favour. Doctor, I'd
like a complete medical workup on both of them. <br>
BASHIR: I can't tell you how glad I am to see you again. Er, both,
both, both of you. <br>
KIRA [OC]: Kira to Sisko. <br>
SISKO: Go ahead. <br>
KIRA [OC]: We just received a priority one transmission from Starfleet
Command. The Breen have attacked Earth.

and the Golden Gate Bridge has a big hole in the middle.) <br>
SISKO: I had a lot of friends in those buildings. Starfleet was able to
destroy most of the Breen attack force, but by then most of the damage
had been done. <br>
MARTOK: We must give the enemy credit. To launch an attack against
Starfleet Headquarters. Even my people never attempted that. We've
learned one thing about the Breen today, Captain. They're a race of
warriors. <br>
SISKO: That's about all we know. Our intelligence reports are sketchy
at best. <br>
MARTOK: Captain, every species has its weakness. They're no exception. <br>
SISKO: Let's hope you're right. But whatever the weakness is, we'd
better find it soon.

keeps getting better. The Federation casualty report are being revised
upward once again. <br>
GOR: (electronic noise) <br>
WEYOUN: Well put. The casualties are merely a bonus. What matters is
that we have struck fear into the hearts of our enemy and made them
feel weak and vulnerable. General, please congratulate your troops for
us. They've done a superb job. Don't you agree, Damar? <br>
DAMAR: Superb. <br>
GOR: (electronic noise) <br>
DAMAR: It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault.
<br>
WEYOUN: Leave it to you, Damar, to point out the one cloud in the sky. <br>
GOR: (electronic noise) <br>
WEYOUN: My thought exactly. It is a very small price for such an
important victory. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must make my report to
the Founder. <br>
(Weyoun leaves.) <br>
DAMAR: By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the
Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. <br>
GOR: (electronic noise) <br>
DAMAR: It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long
ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended
soon, they'll shift the blame to you. <br>
GOR: (electronic noise) <br>
DAMAR: Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if
I were you.

KASIDY: I know. I was just making sure. <br>
SISKO: My peppers? <br>
KASIDY: I know how you like roasted peppers in your casserole. <br>
SISKO: It took me three months to grow them. No one touches my peppers.

KASIDY: I'm so sorry. With all the bad news about Earth I wanted to do
something nice for you. But from now on, you wear the apron in the

SISKO: That's a good idea. <br>
KASIDY: I'm glad you're not mad. I wouldn't want anything to ruin our

SISKO: Our last few nights together? <br>
KASIDY: My cargo run. I leave early next week. <br>
SISKO: No, you're not going anywhere. It's too dangerous. <br>
KASIDY: Ben, the Breen attacked Earth. That's not exactly next door. <br>
SISKO: We don't know where they're going to attack next. I would feel
if you were closer to me. <br>
KASIDY: Well, that's sweet. But I'm going anyway. <br>

(A Gul enters with a PADD) <br>
RUSOT: The information you requested. <br>
DAMAR: Excellent. Sit down. <br>
RUSOT: I'm not sure it's wise for me to stay. What if the Vorta decides
to pay you a visit? <br>
DAMAR: And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my
officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. <br>
(Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) <br>
RUSOT: It doesn't seem right all, this plotting and secrecy. What are
we? Romulans? <br>
(Damar refuses a drink) <br>
DAMAR: No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied
territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and
secrecy. <br>
RUSOT: Can we really hope to defeat the Dominion? With the Breen on
their side, they're stronger than ever. <br>
DAMAR: But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom,
and that will make us even stronger. <br>
RUSOT: I remember the day I heard the news that Cardassia had joined
the Dominion. Like everyone else, I rejoiced. We were going to be
rulers of the entire Alpha Quadrant. Instead, we're a conquered people,
servants in our own land. <br>
DAMAR: All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these
officers? <br>
RUSOT: And the troops under their command. Still, it's not a very long
list, is it? <br>
DAMAR: It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise
up with us. <br>
RUSOT: We'll need to know the exact location of the Dominion weapon
emplacements on Rondac Three. <br>

SOLBOR: Cancel an appearance before the Vedek Assembly? <br>
WINN: Just do it. Cancel everything. <br>
SOLBOR: As you wish. May I ask what exactly you will be doing? <br>
WINN: You certainly may not. But if you must know, I'll be devoting
most of my time to study and meditation. <br>

SOLBOR: I see. <br>
DUKAT: Solbor, I'll have my breakfast on the balcony this morning.
Eminence, is there anything you would like? <br>
WINN: I'm not hungry. <br>
DUKAT: But you really should eat. After all, Bajor is only as strong as
its Kai. <br>
WINN: I said I'm not hungry. Do as he asks. And please, write a note to
the Vedeks expressing my apologies for having to postpone our meeting. <br>
SOLBOR: I'll see to it immediately. <br>

DUKAT: What a tiresome little man. <br>
WINN: Sometimes I think you forget your place, Anjohl. <br>
DUKAT: Oh, forgive me if I've offended you in any way. I am but a moon
made warm by the light of your sun. <br>
WINN: I hope you're a better farmer than you are a poet. <br>
DUKAT: Something is wrong. Tell me, what's bothering you? <br>
WINN: Everything! The prayers, the rituals, these robes. I can't keep
pretending I follow the path of the Prophets. <br>
DUKAT: You won't have to. The Pah wraiths are waiting to embrace you. <br>
WINN: So you keep saying, but when is that going to happen? <br>
DUKAT: As soon as we release them from the fire caves. <br>
WINN: Release them? But the prophecies. <br>
DUKAT: What about them? <br>
WINN: They warn that the release of the Pah wraiths will mean the end
of Bajor. <br>
DUKAT: The old Bajor, perhaps. But from its ashes a new Bajor will
arise and the Restoration will begin. <br>
WINN: Who will be left to see it? <br>
DUKAT: Those the gods find worthy. It will be the dawn of paradise. And
you, Adami, are destined to rule it. <br>
WINN: You're sure of that? <br>
DUKAT: It is meant to be. <br>
WINN: And what will become of you? <br>
DUKAT: I will be at your side for as long as you need me. But first, we
have to release the Pah wraiths. <br>
WINN: How do we do that? <br>
DUKAT: The answer is in the text of the Kosst Amojan. <br>
WINN: Oh. It is forbidden for anyone to open that book. <br>
DUKAT: Yes. Anyone except the Kai. <br>

make this part of the compound less vulnerable. <br>
O'BRIEN: What are you talking about? The south wall isn't the problem.
They came over the north wall, by Travis's position. <br>
BASHIR: I know where they came over, Miles. I am Travis, remember? And
I say we strengthen the south wall, the north wall, and any other place
that helps us keep the enemy out. <br>
O'BRIEN: But then it wouldn't be the battle of the Alamo, would it. <br>
BASHIR: I don't care. I just want to win, once. <br>
O'BRIEN: Be Santa Anna. He wins every time. <br>
BASHIR: What if we put cannons along the long barracks like this? <br>
(Quark nearly puts drinks in the courtyard.) <br>
O'BRIEN: Hey, hey, what do you think you're doing? Do you know how long
it took me to build this thing? <br>
QUARK: I don't believe the two of you. Your homeworld has been
attacked, the Breen have joined forces with the Dominion, and here you
are calmly playing games. <br>
BASHIR: Haven't you ever heard of grace under pressure, Quark? <br>
QUARK: Shouldn't you be doing something more productive? <br>
O'BRIEN: I just spent fourteen hours recalibrating the station's
weapons array. <br>
BASHIR: And I just did a complete run through of the emergency support
team protocols. <br>
QUARK: So, you do expect an attack on the station? <br>
BASHIR: Anything's possible. What about a moat? <br>
O'BRIEN: A moat? Around the Alamo? <br>

they do, there is no way that they can defend that mission against an

thought the Dominion was going to lose this war and drag Cardassia down
with it. <br>
DAMAR: I must admit, things were looking rather grim. <br>
WEYOUN: Perhaps, for a moment or two, but that's no excuse to lose
faith in oneself or one's allies. But now it's as if you've groped your
way through a dark tunnel and stepped back out into the light once

SOLBOR: This book has not been removed from the archives, not for seven

DUKAT: I have no idea why I was chosen. But who are we to question the

forgiveness for questioning their wisdom. <br>

BASHIR: Miles built this Alamo model, replete with little figures.
Quite spectacular, actually. Datasets loaded and verified. Anyway, he
was showing it to me in Quark's when we, rather I, misplaced Colonel
Travis. <br>
NOG: Phaser safeties engaged. Can't you make another one? <br>
O'BRIEN: What, so he can lose it again? Field stabilisers online. <br>
KIRA: That's what happens when you share your toys. Synchronising warp
plasma flow. <br>
O'BRIEN: It's not a toy. It's a model, built to scale. <br>

In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the
