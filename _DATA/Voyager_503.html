SEVEN: Leaping from a spacecraft at exospheric altitudes, a curious
form of recreation. The probe is ready for launch, however there is
still a problem with the telemetry link. Lieutenant. Is something
wrong? <br>
TORRES: Actually, I'm not feeling so well. Can you handle the launch

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
Captain, someone's locked onto our probe with a tractor beam. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It looks like a Malon freighter. <br>
PARIS: I had a feeling we hadn't seen the last of them. <br>
JANEWAY: Open a channel. <br>
KIM: Aye, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Starship Voyager to the Malon vessel. That probe belongs to
us. Release it immediately. <br>
KIM: No response. <br>
JANEWAY: Tom, how fast can you get us there? <br>
PARIS: Two hours at least. <br>
JANEWAY: They'll be long gone. <br>
TUVOK: If we instruct the probe to emit a polaron burst it could
disrupt the tractor beam. <br>
JANEWAY: Do it. <br>
TUVOK: The beam has been disabled. <br>
JANEWAY: Harry, redirect the probe's course. <br>
TUVOK: The Malon are in pursuit. <br>
PARIS: That probe can't outrun them. <br>
JANEWAY: No, but we might be able to hide it from them. <br>
KIM: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: The probe surveyed a class six gas giant this morning. I think
we should send it back for a closer look. <br>
KIM: You're going to steer the probe into a gas giant. <br>
TUVOK: Captain, the atmospheric pressure will crush it. <br>
JANEWAY: Not if the Borg shielding does its job. Hail them again. <br>
KIM: No response. <br>
JANEWAY: Voyager to Malon vessel. Break off your pursuit. <br>
TUVOK: The probe is entering the giant's upper atmosphere, and the
Malon vessel is following it in. <br>
(After the Malon freighter vanishes into the cloud layers, something
goes KaBOOM.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Briefing

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
The probe's stuck in a deep layer of liquid hydrogen and methane about
ten thousand kilometres below the outer atmosphere. It's not responding
to commands. <br>
JANEWAY: Any good news? <br>
SEVEN: It's still intact. It can be repaired, <br>
CHAKOTAY: If we can get it out of there. <br>
(Torres enters.)<br>
TORRES: Sorry I'm late. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We were just discussing how to retrieve the probe. Is there
any possibility of transporting it out? <br>
TORRES: No. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Just no. <br>
TORRES: I don't see how we could get close enough. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Is there any way to boost transporter range? <br>
TORRES: Not in that kind of atmosphere. <br>
PARIS: Well, if we can't transport it out, we'll just have to fly in
and grab it. <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps you weren't paying attention when the Malon freighter
imploded. <br>
PARIS: We won't be going in a Malon freighter, Tuvok. We'll be going in
our new shuttlecraft. <br>
KIM: Here we go again. <br>
PARIS: Let's face it, Class-two shuttles just don't cut it in the Delta
quadrant. We've needed something bigger and better since we got here.
It's time we built it! <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tom, we've been through this I don't know how many times. We
all appreciate your enthusiasm. <br>
KIM: Speak for yourself, Commander. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Bottom line, we don't have time to design and build a ship
from scratch. <br>
PARIS: I knew you were going to say that so I've given us a head start.
<br>
(He activates the wall monitor.)<br>
PARIS: Behold the Delta Flyer. Ultra-aerodynamic contours, retractable
nacelles, parametallic hull plating, unimatrix shielding based on
Tuvok's brilliant design for the multispatial probe, and a
Borg-inspired weapons system. <br>
SEVEN: Basic design elements are adequate. <br>
PARIS: High praise. <br>
KIM: If we used isomagnetic EPS conduits in the plasma manifold, we
could maximise the power distribution. <br>
PARIS: That's the spirit, Harry. <br>
TUVOK: My shield designs could be successfully applied to a vessel of
this size. <br>
PARIS: Big of you to admit it, Tuvok. <br>
CHAKOTAY: And you think it'll be able to withstand the gas giant's
atmosphere. <br>
PARIS: The probe did. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm impressed, but how quickly can it be built? <br>
PARIS: We could replicate the alloys and the new design components, use
spare parts from storage. If we worked around the clock we could have
it up and running inside a week. <br>
KIM: I'm willing to put in as much overtime as it takes. <br>
SEVEN: I will forego regeneration for the duration of the project. <br>
PARIS: What about you, B'Elanna? Building a new vessel from scratch,
that's an engineer's dream come true. <br>
(Torres nods slightly.)<br>
PARIS: What do you say, Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: Why are you all standing around?<br>
(Torres is the last to get up and leave.) </font></p>

model of the new delta-shaped shuttle is floating in the middle of the
room.)<br>
PARIS: Computer, add dynametric tail fins to the nacelles. <br>
TUVOK: Computer, delete dynametric tail fins. <br>
PARIS: What'd you do that for? <br>
TUVOK: We are not designing a hot rod, Lieutenant. <br>
PARIS: That is exactly what we're designing. A twenty fourth century,
warp-powered, ultra-responsive hot rod.<br>
TUVOK: Your embellishments are purely decorative. They serve no
practical purpose. <br>
PARIS: I beg to differ. If we make this thing look mean enough, other
ships are going to think twice before taking us on. <br>
SEVEN: I suggest we return our attention to the matter of structural
integrity. <br>
TUVOK: Agreed. <br>
SEVEN: Lieutenant Torres' hull design is flawed. We should be using
tetraburnium alloys instead of titanium. <br>
KIM: Er, B'Elanna? <br>
TORRES: Sounds fine to me. I'm going to finish up the thruster specs. </font></p>

TORRES: Thruster specs. <br>

TORRES: My quarters. <br>
PARIS: Stay a while. I'll replicate some dinner, a bottle of burgundy.
We deserve a break, don't you think? <br>
TORRES: Not tonight. <br>
PARIS: B'Elanna, what's going on? <br>
TORRES: Nothing. <br>
PARIS: Well, then how come it's impossible to have a conversation with
you? <br>
TORRES: I'm sorry. <br>
PARIS: I don't want an apology. I want an explanation. <br>
TORRES: Tom, I'm tired. <br>
PARIS: Asleep is more like it. You hardly said three words in that last
meeting. And then when Seven changed your design you acted like, like
you didn't care.<br>
TORRES: I guess I didn't. <br>
PARIS: I don't get it. How many times have we talked about how great it
would be to do what we're doing now? To really collaborate my piloting
skills and your engineering expertise. We finally get the chance to
create something together from the ground up and you're not the
slightest bit enthusiastic? <br>
TORRES: I'm doing my job, aren't I? I delivered the thruster specs on
schedule. <br>
PARIS: B'Elanna, I'm not your boss. I'm not questioning your
productivity or keeping tabs on how many hours you put in. I just want
to know what's going on. <br>

JANEWAY: Ensign, put us into a high orbit. I want to stay well above
that ionospheric turbulence. <br>
(It is a lady Ensign at the helm.)<br>
ENSIGN: Aye, ma'am. <br>
JANEWAY: There's the probe. Ten thousand kilometres beneath all that
methane, but still intact. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We're not alone. I'm reading massive theta radiation. It's
being dumped by a Malon freighter approaching from the far side of the
planet. They're hailing. <br>
JANEWAY: They're more talkative than the last ones. Open a channel. <br>
KIM: Aye, sir. <br>
VRELK [on viewscreen]: Leave orbit of this planet now. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't believe we've been introduced. I'm Captain Janeway. <br>
VRELK [on viewscreen]: I know exactly who you are. You are the person
responsible for the destruction of one of our freighters and the deaths
of nine Malon citizens. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm very sorry that lives were lost, but you're leaving out an
important detail. Your people were trying to steal a probe from us. We
warned them to stay away from the gas giant but they didn't listen. <br>
VRELK [on viewscreen]: I'm taking your probe as compensation for our
losses. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's going to be a little difficult. It's stuck beneath the
atmosphere of the same gas giant that crushed your other ship. <br>
VRELK [on viewscreen]: My people are expert at salvage operations. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, Mister. <br>
VRELK [on viewscreen]: Vrelk. Controller Vrelk. <br>
JANEWAY: Vrelk. We have a little expertise of our own. We're a very
determined crew. So my suggestion is that you leave orbit and in the
future, if you come across anything that bears the insignia of the
U.S.S. Voyager, head in the other direction.<br>
VRELK [on viewscreen]: You are making a serious error. <br>
JANEWAY: End transmission. Why would people in the business of toxic
waste disposal be so anxious to get hold of a probe? <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's not just any probe. It's multispatial technology. Maybe
they think it'll help them find new places to dump their garbage.<br>

NEELIX: B'Elanna! What a nice surprise. I was just getting ready to
close. Business has been slow with so many people busy on the new

NEELIX: You want to catch up? With me? <br>
TORRES: If you have the time. <br>
NEELIX: Are you kidding? Yeah. Can I get you something? Name your
poison. <br>

NEELIX: Come on, B'Elanna! I handed that one to you on a silver
platter. <br>
TORRES: Huh? <br>
NEELIX: Name your poison? I was expecting one of those scathing but
affectionate insults you always make about my cooking. <br>
TORRES: Sorry. <br>
NEELIX: You'll feel wittier on a full stomach. So, what'll it be? <br>
TORRES: Actually, I was hoping for banana pancakes. <br>
NEELIX: I don't think I ever heard of banana pancakes before. <br>
TORRES: My grandmother used to make them for me when I was a kid. It's
always put a smile on my face. <br>
NEELIX: Well then, one smile coming right up. <br>
(He walks over to a replicator.)<br>
NEELIX: Computer, one stack of banana pancakes. Smells delicious. <br>
TORRES: Thanks. So how have you been? <br>
NEELIX: Oh, just great. My security training is going really well.
Tuvok told me the other day that I'm, er, not completely inept. Aren't
you going to try them? <br>

CHAKOTAY: Apparently, they're not willing to give up on the probe so
easily. <br>
JANEWAY: The question is, how do they expect to get their hands on it? <br>
TUVOK: It's reasonable to assume they're waiting for us to retrieve the
probe, at which time they'll attempt to steal it again. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe, but they have to know we're prepared for that. If they
were planning to fight you'd think they'd call in reinforcements, try
to out-gun us. <br>

JANEWAY: What have you got? <br>
SEVEN: I've been using coherent neutrino beams to document activity
aboard the Malon freighter. <br>
JANEWAY: In other words, you've been spying on them. <br>
SEVEN: I've made a troubling discovery. This is a polythermal image of
an interior section of the alien ship. The shaded figures you see are
Malon crew members. <br>
TUVOK: That appears to be a small ship. <br>
SEVEN: Correct. The Malon are constructing a spacecraft composed of
tetraburnium alloys. <br>
TUVOK: Theoretically, such a ship would be capable of withstanding
extreme atmospheric pressures. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll be damned. They're going after the probe themselves. <br>
SEVEN: That's not all, Captain. According to my projections, they will
finish construction of their vessel at least thirty six hours before we
finish ours. <br>
JANEWAY: Well then, I'd say we've got an old-fashioned space race on
our hands. <br>

PARIS: Look, we could spend weeks trying to solve this, but we've got a
ticking clock. Engines are working, weapons systems are online. I say
we launch now and hope for the best. <br>
TUVOK: Mister Paris, that is perhaps the most illogical statement
you've ever made. Unless we find a way to reconfigure the structural
integrity field the hull will incur microfractures during descent. <br>
PARIS: Microfractures, Tuvok. Doesn't necessarily mean we'll have a
hull breach. <br>
TUVOK: And if we do, I suppose these useless design elements from your
Captain Proton scenario will compensate for the problem. <br>
PARIS: Hey, every one of these knobs and levers is fully functional. <br>
TUVOK: And completely superfluous. <br>

controls that let me actually feel the ship I'm piloting. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The
doorbell chimes repeatedly.)<br>
TORRES: I'm sleeping! <br>
(Chakotay enters.)<br>
TORRES: Oh. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Hi. <br>
TORRES: Hi. I, I thought you were the Doctor making a house call. <br>
CHAKOTAY: He let you out of the cell block, huh?<br>
TORRES: He thinks familiar surroundings will help speed my recovery. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Recovery from what? <br>
TORRES: That's what I said. He thinks I'm suffering from clinical
depression. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Are you depressed? <br>
TORRES: What are you, the new ship's counsellor? <br>
CHAKOTAY: No. Just a friend. <br>
TORRES: This whole thing is so ridiculous. I don't report a few scrapes
and suddenly Janeway thinks there's something wrong with me. Typical
Starfleet, huh? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You have been running holodeck programmes without safety
protocols. <br>
TORRES: A few, but I haven't put anybody else at risk, and it's nothing
that I can't handle. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tell you what. What do you say you and I pay a little visit
to the holodeck? You can show me some of the programmes you've been
running. <br>
TORRES: Right now? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Sure. Maybe if I see what you've been up to, I can convince
the Captain there's nothing to worry about. <br>
TORRES: She's taken away my holodeck privileges. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Consider them restored. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
CHAKOTAY: Computer, activate holo-programme Torres zeta one. <br>
COMPUTER: Programme activated. <br>
TORRES: What are you doing? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Holodeck
- caves]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Chakotay
drags Torres into the caves. There are flashes of weapons fire, voices
shouting and bodies on the ground.)<br>
TORRES: Computer, freeze programme. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Computer, belay that command. <br>
TORRES: Turn it off! <br>
CHAKOTAY: Not until you tell me what it is! <br>
TORRES: You know what it is. <br>
(Chakotay turns over one charred body.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Who's this? <br>
TORRES: Li-Paz. Don't you recognise him? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Oh, I recognise them all. Meyer. Nelson. Sahreen. You created
a programme to watch all our Maquis friends get slaughtered. What I
want to know is why?<br>
TORRES: I thought we came down here to talk about safety protocols.
This has nothing to do with that. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm not so sure. The logs show you only ran this programme
for forty seven seconds the day after I gave you the news about the
massacre. Then you shut it down and started running the most dangerous
programmes you could find, with the safeties off. Why?! <br>
TORRES: This is ridiculous. I'm leaving. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Computer, seal the doors. <br>
TORRES: You can't do this! <br>
CHAKOTAY: The hell I can't. You're not going anywhere until you tell me
what's going on. B'Elanna, why are you intentionally trying to hurt
yourself? <br>
TORRES: I don't know. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Are you trying to commit suicide? <br>
TORRES: No. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Then why? <br>
TORRES: Because. Because if I sprain my ankle, at least I feel
something. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What do you mean? <br>
TORRES: I'm not trying to kill myself. I'm trying to see if I'm still
alive. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't understand. <br>
TORRES: When you look at those corpses, how do you feel? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Sad. Angry. Maybe a little guilty that I wasn't there to die
with them. <br>
TORRES: Not me. I don't feel anything at all. <br>
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna, the Maquis were like our adopted family. I can
understand you trying to block out that kind of pain. <br>
TORRES: You don't understand. It's not just the pain. I don't feel
anything. Not about my dead friends, not about Tom, you, my job. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe you're afraid if you let yourself start to feel
something, you might not be able to stop. You can't just shut off your
emotions, B'Elanna. Sooner or later you're going to have to let
yourself grieve. <br>
TORRES: Why? Just so I can go through it all over again? <br>
CHAKOTAY: What are you talking about? <br>
TORRES: When I was six, my father walked out on me. When I was
nineteen, I got kicked out of Starfleet. A few years later, I got
separated from the Maquis. And just when I start to feel safe, you tell
me that all of our old friends have been slaughtered. The way I figure
it, I've lost every family I've ever had. <br>
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna, you have a new family now, here on Voyager. You're
not going to lose us. You're stuck with us. <br>
TORRES: You can't promise me that. <br>
CHAKOTAY: No, I suppose I can't. Losing people's inevitable, and
sometimes it happens sooner than we expect. But I can promise you that
the people on this ship aren't about to let you stop living your life
or break your neck on the holodeck. You're going to have to find
another way to deal with this. <br>
TORRES: I don't know how. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Then we'll figure it out. Together. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Commander Chakotay, we're under attack. Report to the
bridge immediately. <br>
TORRES: You'd better go. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Malon
spatial charges are exploding around Voyager.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Why are they suddenly picking a fight? <br>
TUVOK: I believe they're attempting to distract us, Commander, while
they launch their new shuttlecraft.<br>
(And away it flies, into the gas giant.) <br>
TUVOK: The Malon vessel is forty two thousand kilometres from the
probe, and closing. <br>

CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna, I'm in a hurry. <br>
TORRES: I am not out to get myself hurt if that's what you're thinking.
I just want to do my job. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I thought you weren't interested in your job anymore. <br>
TORRES: If that hull breaches, I should be there. I'm still the best

and three thousand kilometres from the probe. <br>
PARIS: We'll catch them. B'Elanna, how's the hull? <br>
TORRES: Structural integrity's down about twelve percent. <br>
SEVEN: They're launching spatial charges. Shields holding. <br>
PARIS: They want to play dirty. Let's show them what a little
Borg-inspired weaponry can do. <br>
SEVEN: Acknowledged. Loading photonic missiles. <br>
(A console goes Bang!)<br>
KIM: We've lost power to secondary systems. <br>
PARIS: Fire. <br>
SEVEN: Three direct hits. <br>
KIM: They're losing attitude control. They're pulling up. <br>
PARIS: Nice shooting, Seven. I'm taking us down to the target. Harry,
get ready to grab the probe. <br>
KIM: Still out of transport range. <br>
TORRES: We're losing integrity. Fifty percent, forty. <br>
PARIS: If you can hold us together for another half a minute we'll be
within range of the target. <br>
SEVEN: We still need to survive the ascent. <br>
PARIS: One thing at a time. <br>
TORRES: We're losing structural integrity. It's down to twenty five
percent. <br>
PARIS: Harry, prepare to lock on. <br>
TORRES: We've got microfractures forming. Aft starboard hull, zone two.
<br>
KIM: I've got a lock. Beaming the probe into the cargo hold. Got it! <br>
PARIS: Initiating rapid ascent. <br>
(A panel starts to buckle.)<br>
TORRES: Harry, I need those secondary systems back online. <br>
KIM: I can't. They're fried. (Torres pulls a cover off another section
and places it over the failing panel, then starts to weld it in place.)<br>
SEVEN: Lieutenant, what are you doing? <br>
TORRES: Patching a hole before it opens. <br>
KIM: That'll never hold. <br>
TORRES: It'll hold a minute or two, and with any luck that's all we
need. Seven, take over here. I need an EPS relay. <br>
KIM: Er, there's one in the transporter control circuitry. <br>
SEVEN: The panel is sealed. <br>
TORRES: Good. Get away from it. <br>
(She attaches the relay to a device she has taken from a locker.)<br>
TORRES: I need a phaser.<br>
(Kim
throws one to her. She plugs it into the device as the repair starts to
buckle. Then she turns the phaser on and adjusts the EPS relay power
feed.)<br>
TORRES:&nbsp; Watch out. I don't know if this is going to work. <br>
(She creates a forcefield across the area of the microfractures. When
the hull breaches, the ship is still safe.)<br>
