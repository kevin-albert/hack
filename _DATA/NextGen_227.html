there about five centuries. <br>
DATA: At some future date I will be transported back to nineteenth
century Earth, where I will die. It has occurred. It will occur. <br>
GUINAN: Do I know you, Mister? <br>
DATA: Data. Yes. We were on a ship together. The Enterprise. <br>
GUINAN: Is that a clipper ship? <br>
DATA: It is a starship. <br>
CLEMENS: Starship? <br>
RIKER: My God. They're delivering more of them for the others to
ingest. <br>
GUINAN: Did my father send you here? Because if he did, you must go
back and tell him I'm not done listening to <br>
DATA: I was not sent by your father. Our ship encountered a species who
appears to be threatening nineteenth century Earth. <br>
RIKER: I'm not willing to accept that he's dead and just leave it at
that. <br>
PICARD: We cannot make Mister Data our priority. <br>
RIKER: What is more important than Data? <br>
GUINAN: Do you remember the first time we met? <br>
PICARD: Of course. <br>
GUINAN: Don't be so sure. If you don't go on this mission, we'll never
meet. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CLEMENS: I have long been interested in the notion
of time travellers. In fact, I wrote a book about it. It chronicles the
tale of a man of our era who fouled the sixth century by introducing
newfangled gadgets and weapons all in the name of progress. This idea
of time travel is not so far fetched as it might seem. In fact, I have
learned that, even now, there are people from the future right here in
San Francisco and I have no doubt that their intent is to foul our
world just as my Yankee did in King Arthur's time. Well, sir, let me
serve notice. As soon as I have the necessary evidence, I intend to
expose them and make it absolutely clear that they are not welcome
here. <br>
REPORTER: Yes, sir. And will this be a sequel to Connecticut Yankee,
Mister Twain? <br>
CLEMENS: The name's Clemens, son. Sam Clemens. That's with an e. <br>
REPORTER: With an e. Got it. <br>
(Data comes out of his hotel) <br>
CLEMENS: Excuse me. <br>
(As Clemens follows Data, the Devidians walk the other way)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: (dressed as a policeman) The coroner said
this is where they kept all the cholera victims. <br>
CRUSHER: (taking tricorder scans) It doesn't make sense that so many
people are dying of cholera. It just isn't that virulent. Will, this is
strange. <br>
RIKER: What is it? <br>
CRUSHER: The cerebellum, the cerebral cortex, the brain stem, the
entire nervous system has been depleted of electrochemical energy.
Here's another one. Same neural depletion. These people did not die of
cholera. They died because their neural energy was drained somehow. <br>
RIKER: Drained and taken to Devidia Two for those aliens to ingest? If
you were a time traveller with a taste for human neural energy where
would you get your supply? <br>
CRUSHER: I would travel back to a time when there were plagues and
epidemics, so I could murder and use disease as a cover.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(all the away team are in period costume) <br>
CRUSHER: Over half the victims whose neural energy had been drained
came from the Sisters of Hope Infirmary. <br>
RIKER: A charity hospital near the waterfront. <br>
TROI: If the aliens have been killing people there, well, someone might
have noticed something unusual. <br>
PICARD: And if they're moving among humans, they must have taken on
human form. But the question is, how do we know who we're looking for? <br>
RIKER: The tricorder indicated triolic activity from most of the bodies
we looked at. If the aliens left that sort of signature, they'll be
detectable. <br>
LAFORGE: You know, we might even be able to rig some kind of alien
alarm system. <br>
RIKER: Any luck contacting Data? <br>
LAFORGE: None. The tricorder's broadcasting random emissions on all
frequencies his sub-processors might pick up, but the range is limited.
Almost anything could interfere. <br>
(there's a knock at the door) <br>
LAFORGE: She's back. <br>
(Geordi takes off his visor) <br>
CARMICHAEL [OC]: Mister Pikerd! <br>
PICARD: Yes, Mrs. Carmichael. <br>
CARMICHAEL: (Irish accent) Mister Pikerd. I'll be reminding you that
it's one o'clock. <br>
PICARD: Yes. <br>
CARMICHAEL: One o'clock on a Thursday. I'm sure I made it clear to you
that the rent is always due, payable in full, by one o'clock on
Wednesdays. <br>
PICARD: Ah, yes, er, the rent. Mrs. Carmichael, even now my troupe are
in rehearsals for a new production. <br>
CARMICHAEL: Oh? I haven't heard of any new production. What play is it?
<br>
PICARD: The play? A Midsummer Night's Dream. We have performed in
London, Paris, Milan. Milan. To sold out houses. I assure you, you will
have the rent, in full, with a bonus. <br>
CARMICHAEL: Oh, no, no, no, no. I've heard you silver-tongued devils
before. I'll have the rent in full tomorrow by one o'clock or you'll be
out performing on the street.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BELLBOY: I wouldn't do this for just anybody,
Mister Clemens. And I hope you won't spread it around that I let you
in. People start talking. <br>
(Clemens starts searching the room) <br>
CLEMENS: Of course not, Jack. And I assure you that Mister Data would
be most upset if you didn't. If I can't find that Letter of Intent that
he left me, our major investor is going to pull out and take his
business elsewhere. <br>
BELLBOY: It has to do with Mister Data's engine, doesn't it? <br>
CLEMENS: Engine? <br>
BELLBOY: Yes. <br>
CLEMENS: Oh, yes. Yes, this is exactly what it's all about. Ow! <br>
(he gets a shock from it) <br>
BELLBOY: You know, Mister Clemens, I'm going to do you another favour
today. You're always looking for good stories, right? Well, I've got a
real humdinger for you. The story of my life. Now, I know you may think
I'm young, but I've covered a lot of ground and if I do say so myself,
it'd make for some pretty fascinating reading. So, what do you think? <br>
CLEMENS: About what? <br>
BELLBOY: About writing my life story. You and me. Literary partners, of
course. <br>
CLEMENS: Young man, I have a maxim that I have always lived by. No one
is more qualified to write your story than you are. <br>
BELLBOY: Me? Be a writer? You think I could do that? <br>
CLEMENS: As long as you write what you know. You got any passions, boy?
Any dreams? <br>
BELLBOY: I'd like to do some travelling, maybe go to sea. And Alaska.
I've had the strangest notion to go see Alaska. <br>
CLEMENS: That's a great idea, son. That's exactly what I would do if I
were your age. Alaska, the Klondike, the Aurora Borealis. That's it.
Follow your dreams and write about 'em. <br>
BELLBOY: Thank you, Mister Clemens. You know, that is exactly what I'm
going to do. <br>
CLEMENS: You do that, son. <br>
BELLBOY: You'll see my name in print, too. <br>
CLEMENS: I'm sure I will. <br>
BELLBOY: Don't forget. The name's London. Jack London. <br>
CLEMENS: Goodbye now. Bye-bye. <br>
(and ushers Jack out of the room and locks the door so he can examine
the Contraption closely. There's the sound of a door, and Clemens hides
in the wardroom. Data and Guinan enter) <br>
GUINAN: I found the Head Surveyor, I found the cavern. You will not be
able to get to it. The entrance is on a mine shaft that is the middle
of the Presidio on an army base. <br>
DATA: Perhaps you could arrange for us to get in. <br>
GUINAN: How? <br>
DATA: With permission to dig for the mine shaft. <br>
GUINAN: Oh, no, Data. I've done everything you've asked <br>
DATA: I have full confidence in your persuasive abilities. <br>
GUINAN: Well, I suppose it's more interesting than throwing a tea
dance. <br>
DATA: Strange. The transceiver assembly has been removed. Without it I
will be unable to track the time shifts. <br>
GUINAN: Twain. <br>
DATA: Clemens? <br>
GUINAN: Yes. He's been driving me crazy. He watches the house, he
follows me down the street asking me questions. If anyone took this you
can believe it was him. <br>
DATA: If you are correct, he must be warned. The device has been
modified in such a way that prolonged contact with human tissue would
be highly toxic. <br>
(there's a thump from the wardrobe. Data opens the door to reveal the
guilty party. Data picks up the
transceiver that Clemens dropped.) <br>
CLEMENS: Madame Guinan. Mister Data. <br>
GUINAN: Shame on you, Mister Clemens. Shame. <br>
CLEMENS: Shame, madam? I think not. I find no shame in my efforts to
uncover your plot. <br>
GUINAN: I keep telling you, there is no plot. <br>
CLEMENS: Yes, you do keep telling me that. What an interesting pair you
are. Where in Switzerland did you say you were from, Mister Data? <br>
DATA: I am French, sir, not Swiss. <br>
CLEMENS: Oh yes, that's right, now I remember. A Frenchman with a
talent for poker, from what I hear. You know, I was talking to a friend
of mine, Ches Whitley. He says to say hello and wonders when you're
coming back. <br>
DATA: I do not believe I know Mister Whitley. <br>
CLEMENS: No? He works at the County Assayer's office. He says you've
been in there a number of times claiming to be a geological engineer
and wanting information about mining operations during the 1850's. You
remember him now? <br>
DATA: I am unfamiliar with the gentleman's name. I have spoken to
several people at that office. <br>
CLEMENS: Yes, I know. And in the Hall of Records, and in the Geological
Society, and a little-known mineral shop in Chinatown. You do get
around, don't you? <br>
DATA: As apparently you do, Mister Clemens. <br>
CLEMENS: I must admit you've got me mystified. This contraption, for
instance. It's very unusual. It looks quite futuristic. Tell me, might
it have something to do with time shifts? <br>
DATA: In a sense. The time shift is a gearing system I have invented
for the horseless carriage. <br>
CLEMENS: Do not insult me. You have come here to this century and
brought your infernal technology with you for God only knows what
purpose, but I have no doubt it will be the people of this century who
will suffer for it. <br>
GUINAN: My dear Mister Clemens, I do think we've heard enough. Mister
Data's business is his own, and I will thank you to leave now. <br>
CLEMENS: Pardon me, Madam Guinan, but it is my business too. It is the
business of all humanity, I believe, to stop both of you from whatever
it is you are doing here. And that is what I intend to do. </font></p>

CRUSHER: I'll try to manage. <br>

LAFORGE: There, by that bed. I can see an afterimage of triolic waves.
They've been here recently. I'd say within the last twenty four hours. <br>
CRUSHER: That's the bed where the man died last night. <br>
TROI: This man was complaining about a strange doctor and nurse who
visited that patient. Perhaps they're still in the hospital. <br>
(a patient starts coughing) <br>
CRUSHER: (gives a drink) Here. This'll make you more comfortable. <br>
(Picard's gas lamp detector starts flashing and Crusher's tricorder
beeps. She keys her comm. badge then goes over to the slim man and
woman.) <br>
CRUSHER: Do you need any help, Doctor? Doctor Apollinaire felt he had
entered the algid stage. He was cyanotic, pulse unobservable. That's an
interesting cane. <br>

TROI: The ophidian the aliens were carrying. <br>
(it sends off energy charges before reverting to the cane) <br>
RIKER: What the? <br>
LAFORGE: These look like minute distortions in the space-time
continuum, like the one we saw on Devidia Two. <br>
RIKER: They were so small, and they lasted only a second. <br>
DATA: The aliens appear to be able to concentrate the distortion and
direct it to a specific time and place. <br>
CRUSHER: Maybe they have something, a mechanism that focuses it. <br>
LAFORGE: Any device like that would produce significant levels of
triolic waves. Like the ones in the cavern where Data's head was found.

on Devidia Two. There's no indication of a control mechanism. <br>
LAFORGE: I'm not so sure. My visor is picking up crystalline fractures.
These cavern walls have undergone some kind of selective molecular
polarisation. In fact, if I'm right this whole cavern has been
configured to focus the space-time distortion. Just like a lens.
Captain, we think we might be on to something. The cavern itself seems
to be acting as a focusing mechanism. I'm willing to bet it's the same
at their habitat back on Devidia Two. <br>
PICARD: If we can get back there and destroy that site, it might put an
end to their time travelling. <br>
RIKER: We have the ophidian. <br>
LAFORGE: Truthfully, I don't know that we can get back. The aliens use
triolic energy as a power source. The energy our phasers generates
might not be entirely compatible. <br>

will regretfully waive that opportunity for the
privilege of taking you all in to the authorities. <br>

and your evasions, and I will listen no longer. It is my moral duty to
protect mankind from whatever devious plan you have in mind. Now, move
along. I suspect that even time travellers are vulnerable to the Colt
forty five. Now, let's go. I made a young fellow a promise and I don't
want to be late. <br>

knew that. <br>

supposed to do? <br>
GUINAN: If I told you what happened in that cavern, it would affect any
decision you'd make now. I can't do that. I won't. <br>

We're talking about Jean-Luc Picard. I can't sit around and hope it all
works out. I've got to do something.

only serves to take away life's simple pleasures. You don't even let a

TROI: I think what we've gained far outweighs anything that might have
been lost. <br>
CLEMENS: Oh? Well, I'm not so impressed with this future. Huge
starships, and weapons that can no doubt destroy entire cities, and
military conquest as a way of life? <br>

before you brought him here to serve you. <br>
TROI: He's one of the thousands of species that we've encountered. We
live in a peaceful Federation with most of them. The people you see are
here by choice. <br>
CLEMENS: So there're a privileged few who serve on these ships, living
in luxury and wanting for nothing. But what about everyone else? What
about the poor? You ignore them. <br>
TROI: Poverty was eliminated on Earth a long time ago, and a lot of
other things disappeared with it. Hopelessness, despair, cruelty. <br>
CLEMENS: Young lady, I come from a time when men achieve power and
wealth by standing on the backs of the poor, where prejudice and
intolerance are commonplace and power is an end unto itself. And you're
telling me that isn't how it is anymore? <br>

the explosion is re-phased into the aliens' time continuum. <br>

get the variance we need. <br>

should return to the nineteenth century and remain there so your

CLEMENS: There's risk in everything. The point is, it's the right
choice. I've got more books to write, and your Captain has a job to do
here. <br>
