<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: Captain. Communication from Starfleet. They
have reported a disturbance in the Neutral Zone. <br>
PICARD: Of what nature? <br>
WORF: A battle. Quadrant nine, coordinates zero seven zero, mark three.
There's no information who is involved. They are asking if we can
investigate. <br>
PICARD: Answer affirmative. Lieutenant La Forge, lay in the course. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. <br>
DATA: I have no reports of any Federation ships in that area, sir. <br>
RIKER: Ferengi? <br>
PICARD: It's a little out of their territory. <br>
RIKER: Shall we separate the saucer? <br>
PICARD: Let's get a little more information first. <br>
LAFORGE: Course set, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Speed, warp seven. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir, warp seven. <br>
PICARD: Engage. <br>
(A short flight later) <br>
LAFORGE: We are now approaching the Neutral Zone. <br>
TASHA: Sir, sensors indicate several recent photon explosions and heavy
phaser activity. <br>
DATA: Sir, I have analysed the residue from the explosions. This is of
no known Ferengi design. It is possibly Romulan. <br>
PICARD: Now there's a name we haven't heard for a while. <br>
RIKER: I could go a lot longer without hearing it. <br>
PICARD: If the Romulans have returned to this sector we should know
about that. Mister Worf, any further activity? <br>
WORF: Negative, sir. <br>
PICARD: Slow to half impulse. <br>
LAFORGE: Going to one half impulse. Now entering quadrant nine zero
seven, mark three. <br>
PICARD: Shields and deflectors up. Go to Yellow Alert. <br>
DATA: I have located a vessel, sir. It is drifting. <br>
PICARD: Put it on main viewer. <br>
TASHA: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Magnify. <br>
(An angular, practical ship, like an Eagle transporter) <br>
DATA: The life support systems on the ship are failing, sir.
Propulsion, navigation, and all communication, inoperative. <br>
PICARD: Any trace of the other vessel? <br>
DATA: No, sir. <br>
RIKER: If it is a Romulan vessel, it could be cloaked. <br>
PICARD: Tell Starfleet we're entering the Neutral Zone. <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: Mister La Forge, take us in a little closer. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Stay sharp everyone. <br>
RIKER: It's Talarian. <br>
PICARD: Life signs? <br>
WORF: Nothing yet, sir. <br>
DATA: I have identified the vessel, Captain. It is the Batris, a
general cargo vessel. <br>
RIKER: A long way from home. <br>
PICARD: Keep alert. <br>
WORF: Captain, possible life signs. <br>
PICARD: What do you mean, possible? <br>
WORF: The readings emanate from a location near what is left of main
Engineering. There is a great deal of magnetic and radioactive clutter
making a positive determination difficult. <br>
RIKER: I'll prepare an away team. <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, you stay at your post. If this is the result of
a Romulan attack, they may still be in the area. <br>
TASHA: Aye, sir. <br>
RIKER: Data, Geordi, let's go. <br>
PICARD: Mister La Forge, are we close enough to use the Visual Acuity
transmitter? <br>
LAFORGE: We can certainly try it, sir. <br>
PICARD: Please do. And Number One? Everything about this seems wrong. <br>
RIKER: Agreed. It smells like a trap. Let's go.

the Neutral Zone, where a Talarian freighter has been severely damaged
in a battle. I have sent an away team to investigate. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Geordi has attached a block to the side of his
visor) <br>
RIKER: What exactly does this device do? <br>
LAFORGE: Data and I have been working on a way to transmit what my
visor sees. If it works, the Bridge'll be able to monitor us. <br>
DATA: It has restrictions. The information from Geordi's visor is so
complex it is difficult to encode. Therefore the signal breaks down
easily. <br>
RIKER: That means it doesn't have much range. <br>
LAFORGE: Exactly. So far, the effective range is only few kilometres,
but we're working on it. La Forge to Bridge. <br>
WORF [OC]: This is the Bridge. <br>
LAFORGE: Worf, I've switched on the Visual Acuity Transmitter. <br>
WORF [OC]: We are receiving. The signal is strong. <br>
LAFORGE: Okay, Worf. I am switching off for transport. <br>
RIKER: Set phasers on stun. Let's be ready for anything. Energise.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Ready to receive. Put this on main viewer. <br>
TASHA: Aye, sir. <br>
(A vision of weird coloured shapes, edges moving and blurring. As if
the viewer has been taking something highly illegal and mind-altering) <br>
PICARD: Extraordinary. Now I'm beginning to understand him. <br>
PICARD: Geordi. What was that? Over to the left. <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: What? <br>
PICARD: Yes, that. No, no, back. Yes, that. Right there. What is that? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Ah, to me it's just an undefined form,
standing in a visual frenzy. Can you filter out the extraneous
information? <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: No, I get it all simultaneously. <br>
PICARD: But it's just a jumble. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Batris Corridor]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD [OC]: How can you make head or tail of it? <br>
LAFORGE: I select what I want and then disregard the rest. <br>
PICARD [OC]: But how is that possible? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, how, in a noisy room, can you select one specific voice
or sound? <br>
PICARD [OC]: Of course, something you learn. <br>
LAFORGE: Exactly. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE [OC]: It's something I have learned. Does
that make it more clear?&nbsp;<br>
PICARD: Look over at Data. There's an aura around Data. <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: Well, of course. He's an android. <br>
PICARD: You say that as if you think that's what we all see. <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: Don't you? </font></p>

(As they move on, a conduit falls. This ship is ready to fall apart) <br>
DATA: I am detecting high levels of deuterium gas, probably from the
leakage in the drive system. <br>
RIKER: Toxic? <br>
DATA: Not as yet, sir. The life signs are emanating from the far side
of Engineering. <br>
RIKER: What's the safest way around? <br>
DATA: All routes are equally dangerous, sir. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, what's the least dangerous route, Data? <br>
DATA: There is no significant difference. <br>
RIKER: Steady on. <br>
LAFORGE: Commander Riker! Commander. <br>
RIKER: Yes, Geordi. <br>
LAFORGE: There's a fissure developing in the bulkhead. The skin of the
ship is losing its integrity. <br>
