is. May I introduce myself? <br>
BASHIR: Er, yes, yes, of course. <br>
GARAK: My name is Garak. Cardassian by birth, obviously. The only one
of us left on this station, as a matter of fact, so I do appreciate
making new friends whenever I can. You are new to this station, I
believe. <br>
BASHIR: I am, yes. Though, though I understand you've been here quite a
while. <br>
GARAK: Ah, you know of me then. <br>
BASHIR: Would you care for some of this Tarkalean tea? It's very good. <br>
GARAK: What a thoughtful young man. How nice that we've met. <br>
BASHIR: You know, some people say that you remained on DS Nine as the
eyes and ears of your fellow Cardassians. <br>
GARAK: You don't say? Doctor, you're not intimating that I'm considered
some sort of spy, are you? <br>
BASHIR: I wouldn't know, sir. <br>
GARAK: Ah. An open mind. The essence of intellect. As you may also
know, I have a clothing shop nearby, so if you should require any
apparel, or merely wish, as I do, for a bit of enjoyable company now
and then, I'm at your disposal, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: You're very kind, Mister Garak. <br>
GARAK: Oh, it's just Garak. Plain, simple Garak. Now, good day to you,
Doctor. I'm so glad to have made such an interesting new friend today.

next to me at the Replimat <br>
O'BRIEN: Major, upper pylon three'll be shut down for maintenance for
forty-eight hours. <br>
BASHIR: The spy! Garak, the Cardassian. <br>
SISKO: We don't know for a fact Garak's a spy, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: He is. You should have heard him. He introduced himself and he
struck up conversation just like that. he was making contact with me,
with me of all people. <br>
DAX: What do you think he might want from you, Julian? <br>
BASHIR: I don't know. Federation medical secrets? Rest assured they're
safe with me, Commander. <br>
SISKO: I'm sure they are, Doctor Bashir. <br>
BASHIR: In fact, Chief O'Brien, I think you should place a monitoring
device on me. Well, just in case he's up to something? <br>
SISKO: I don't think that'll be necessary, Doctor. Just be very
cautious when you're around him. <br>
KIRA: (who's had a hair cut) Commander? We've got a small craft taking
evasive action. Cardassian war vessel in pursuit. <br>
SISKO: On screen. <br>
KIRA: That's Bajoran. That damned Cardassian's firing at a Bajoran
scout ship in Bajoran space! <br>
SISKO: Mister O'Brien? <br>
O'BRIEN: Confirmed, sir. They've crossed into Bajoran space. <br>
SISKO: Open a hailing frequency to the Cardassians. <br>
O'BRIEN: Channel open. <br>
SISKO: Cardassian vessel, you are violating Bajoran space. Break off
your pursuit. Repeat, break off now. <br>
O'BRIEN: No reply from the Cardassians. The Bajoran vessel is hailing
us. <br>
SISKO: Open the channel. <br>
TAHNA [OC]: Space station, do you read? Space station <br>
O'BRIEN: We can only get audio, Commander. <br>
SISKO: This is Benjamin Sisko, Starfleet Commander of the station. Who
are you? Why are they pursuing? <br>
TAHNA [OC]: Please! Repeating request for emergency docking! Please! <br>
DAX: The Bajoran scout ship is badly damaged. Structural integrity is
failing. <br>
(The little ship gets hit again) <br>
DAX: He's breaking up. <br>
SISKO: Get him out, Mister O'Brien. <br>
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. <br>
(KaBOOM, and a crouching figure is beamed in) <br>
BASHIR: Medical assistance to Ops. <br>
TAHNA: My name is Tahna Los. Request political asylum. Kira? <br>
(after the opening credits, medics are wheeling Tahna away) <br>
KIRA: His name is Tahna Los. We fought together in the underground. <br>
O'BRIEN: Commander, the Cardassians are hailing us. <br>
KIRA: Now they want to talk. <br>
O'BRIEN: They're hopping mad. <br>
SISKO: Open the channel, Mister O'Brien. <br>
GUL DANAR [on viewscreen]: Federation Commander, you've taken aboard a
known criminal. You will turn him over to us. <br>
SISKO: He has requested asylum. <br>
GUL DANAR [on viewscreen]: You have not granted it. <br>
SISKO: To be honest, I haven't decided yet. <br>
GUL DANAR [on viewscreen]: He is Kohn-Ma! Even the Bajorans would not
grant his kind asylum. He has committed heinous crimes against the
Cardassian people and I demand you release him to our custody. <br>
SISKO: I'll investigate the matter immediately. In the interim, if
you'd care to dock your vessel, I'll be glad to hear an explanation for
having violated Bajoran space and threatened a Federation facility. <br>
GUL DANAR [on viewscreen]: We have made no threat to your facility. <br>
SISKO: I stand corrected. Sisko out. <br>
(transmission ends) <br>
SISKO: The Major and I will be at the Infirmary. I'd like some time to
talk with this fellow Tahna. When Gul Danar comes in, it'd be nice if
we had a few docking regulations to keep him outside a while. <br>
O'BRIEN: Understood. <br>
(Sisko and Kira get onto the lift) <br>
KIRA: You're not seriously considering handing Tahna over to the
Cardassians?

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Were you part of this Kohn-Ma, Major? <br>
KIRA: If I had been, I would not be working with the provisional
government now. <br>
SISKO: You'd still be out murdering Cardassians or even some Bajorans
that the Kohn-Ma hold in contempt. Didn't they claim responsibility for
the assassination of one of your First Ministers last month?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Promenade]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: Look, I know Tahna. <br>
SISKO: Is he Kohn-Ma? <br>
KIRA: Yes, but <br>
SISKO: I suggest you get your priorities straight, Major, because I
don't have any room for divided loyalties in this command. And I won't
have a Kohn-Ma terrorist using this station as a protective shield for
continuing violence. <br>
KIRA: My priorities are straight, Commander. Let's not be confused
here. my loyalties are to Bajor, and Bajor needs men like Tahna Los. <br>
SISKO: Apparently his war with the Cardassians isn't over yet. <br>
KIRA: If Bajor is ever to rebuild a strong and independent society, it
will require the repatriation of splinter groups like the Kohn-Ma. You
have, we have, an opportunity here, Commander. I hope you don't miss
it.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tahna is on his side on a biobed) <br>
KIRA: How is he? <br>
BASHIR: Second degree burns, lacerations, a minor concussion. Not much
compared to what he's been through before. <br>
SISKO: Before? <br>
BASHIR: The most recent of these scars is only two, perhaps three years
old. <br>
TAHNA: Two and a half, actually. <br>
BASHIR: It's remarkable you lived through this. <br>
KIRA: It's a Cardassian technique designed to keep you alive. <br>
SISKO: I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko. I have a few questions for you if
you're up to answering them. <br>
KIRA: Commander Sisko hasn't decided whether to grant you asylum yet,
Tahna. <br>
SISKO: Major, perhaps I should conduct this alone. <br>
TAHNA: Major? <br>
KIRA: I'm the liaison officer to the Federation here. Still fighting
for Bajor in my own way. I'll stop by later. <br>
(Kira leaves) <br>
TAHNA: What do you need to know, Commander? <br>
SISKO: For starters, why were they chasing you? <br>
TAHNA: You really want to hear the story of my life? <br>
SISKO: I assume as a member of the Kohn-Ma you've committed serious
acts against them. <br>
TAHNA: Any one of a hundred that would lead to a Cardassian death
sentence. <br>
SISKO: Any of them since their withdrawal from Bajor? <br>
TAHNA: Frankly, yes. <br>
SISKO: Why would you continue the violence against them now? <br>
TAHNA: To be honest, I'm not sure anymore. We say we're punishing them
for crimes committed against us for over half a century, but I've had
enough of the killing. <br>
BASHIR: I'm sorry, Commander. He needs rest now. </font></p>

short-sighted. He obviously doesn't understand the issues involved. <br>
ROLLMAN [on monitor]: Thank you for bringing this to my attention,
Major. I'll stay in close touch with the situation. <br>

I see them. <br>

you've never fought the Cardassians, have you? <br>

there. <br>
TAHNA: Wearing that uniform, I thought maybe you'd forgotten. <br>
KIRA: Never. <br>
TAHNA: Working on the inside hasn't dulled that old fire just a little?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GUL DANAR: If you require all vessels to endure
such lengthy docking procedures, Commander, you're going to have a lot
of impatient traffic out there. <br>
SISKO: I apologise. We're still trying to repair all the damage your
forces did before they left. It does create unreasonable delays. <br>
GUL DANAR: I accept your apology, but not your explanation. What about
Tahna Los? <br>
SISKO: Well, we've got a problem. <br>
GUL DANAR: A diplomatic insult to the Cardassian people would be a
problem. Delivering a wanted criminal to us would not be. <br>
SISKO: Danar, in war, both sides commit atrocities. <br>
GUL DANAR: I can only tell you that we are certain he plans to commit
more acts of terrorism <br>
SISKO: He tells me that he has renounced the Kohn-Ma and wants to help
to rebuild Bajor. <br>
GUL DANAR: He committed brutal acts of destruction and murder and he
must pay for those crimes. <br>
SISKO: I appreciate the Cardassian position but I know if a Bajoran
freedom-fighter is turned over to the Cardassians by the Federation,
that would be a mistake that would undermine everything that I'm trying
to accomplish here. So, with apologies, I'm going to grant him asylum
for the time being. Eventually, he'll want to relocate to Bajor and if
you want to pursue the matter with the Provisional Government, then
that's your business.

bed? <br>
TAHNA: I can adapt to that part very quickly, thank you. <br>
KIRA: I'm glad you're here. We need you, Tahna. <br>
TAHNA: I don't think the Federation has any use for my particular
talents. <br>
KIRA: I mean Bajor needs you. If you had the impression that I'm a
Federation officer in any way, I promise you I <br>
TAHNA: I thought you were under Sisko's command. <br>
KIRA: I am, but <br>
TAHNA: You see, that's something I could never adapt to. <br>
KIRA: Somebody has to coordinate relations between the Federation and
the Provisional Government, At least with someone like me here <br>
TAHNA: Why? Why should they be here at all? What right does this
so-called Provisional Government have to bring them here <br>
KIRA: I know <br>
TAHNA: After everything we fought for, Kira. Freedom from domination,
true independence. No outsiders. No Cardassians, and no Federations. <br>
KIRA: Things have changed, Tahna. With the discovery of the wormhole <br>
TAHNA: Oh, yes, the wormhole. <br>
KIRA: Look, I don't want the Federation here any more than you do but
they are serving a purpose. For the time being, at least. Without the
Federation, the Cardassians would be back in a minute to take control
of the wormhole. And the wormhole is the future of Bajor, Tahna. It's
bringing ships and commerce. It's making us a power in the quadrant. <br>
TAHNA: I don't want to be a power in the quadrant. I want Bajor for
Bajorans. I want our homeland back. <br>
KIRA: We have it back. And as we grow stronger, we'll be able to defend
it ourselves without having to lean on the Federation or anyone else. I
know it's difficult to see. After all we've been through, we want it
all now. But with people like you leading the way <br>
TAHNA: You have adapted, haven't you. <br>
KIRA: Tahna, I've put myself on the line for you here. You are finished
with the Kohn-Ma? <br>
TAHNA: Yes. Yes, I am finished with the Kohn-Ma. <br>
KIRA: I've been talking with several of the ministers of the
Provisional Government about amnesty. For you and any member of the
Kohn-Ma who follows you. <br>
TAHNA: There are some who might, if there were assurances. <br>

GARAK: There's a time for levity, my young friend, and a time for
genuine concern. The arrival on this station, for instance, of those
two Kohn-Ma terrorists. <br>
(On the upper Promenade level, Tahna is talking to two men.) <br>
BASHIR: Terrorists? What are they doing here? <br>
GARAK: I'm not exactly sure. But together, we might have some success
at finding out. <br>
BASHIR: Garak, I'm a doctor <br>

know what to do with it. <br>
BASHIR: I really must be getting along now. <br>
GARAK: Doctor, I think it's time for you to take advantage of my shop.
If you'll be there at exactly twenty fifty five hours tonight, I
promise to show you a suit that will make you into a new man. <br>
BASHIR: A suit? We're talking about terrorists, and you want me to buy
a new suit? <br>
GARAK: Doctor, am I making myself clear? I want you to buy a new suit
tonight at twenty fifty five, exactly. <br>

terrorists) A suit? </font></p>

has gotten a little out of hand. <br>
SISKO: How's that? <br>
BASHIR: He wants me to buy a suit. <br>
SISKO: A suit? <br>
BASHIR: At exactly twenty fifty five tonight. <br>
SISKO: Why twenty fifty five? <br>
BASHIR: I don't know but it has something to do with those two Bajoran
terrorists on board. He says that together, he and I might discover
what they're really doing here. I don't understand why he wants me
involved. <br>
SISKO: Sometimes communications can't be conducted through official
channels. Maybe this is their way of telling us that we have a common
enemy. <br>
BASHIR: Well, what do you want me to do? <br>

KIRA: What's that? <br>
ODO: Pretence. There's a special talent to it. It's as hard for me as
creating one of your noses. <br>
KIRA: Maybe that's why I've learned to respect your opinion, Constable.
Never any pretence. How much do you know about me, Odo? <br>
ODO: More than you probably realise. <br>
KIRA: I've done some things I'm not proud of. I still have nightmares
about the raids on the Haru outposts, but at least I was sure of what I
was doing then. <br>
ODO: And there's something you're not sure of now. <br>
KIRA: You have no more love for the Federation than I do. <br>
ODO: Meaning? <br>
KIRA: Maybe there are still wars to be fought and I'm just making a

ODO: It sounds like you're trying to talk yourself into something. Or

KIRA: They're no different than I used to be. <br>
ODO: Used to be. <br>
KIRA: I could just refuse to help them. Ignore the whole thing. <br>
ODO: The Joranian ostrich hides by sticking its head under water.
Sometimes even until it drowns. <br>
KIRA: Then they'd find a way to do whatever they want to do anyway and
I'd still feel responsible for the consequences. It was so much easier
when I knew who the enemy was. <br>

B'ETOR: The rendezvous will be on the dark side of Bajor Eight's lower
moon. The Cardassians can have him then. <br>
(The sisters leave the shop and Garak lets Bashir out) <br>
BASHIR: What's bilitrium? <br>
GARAK: A rare crystalline element, that can be an incredibly powerful
source of energy. Provided, of course, one also has an anti-matter
converter. Unfortunately, that's why Cardassians were chasing Tahna Los
when he arrived here. He stole one. <br>

At least this way you can find out what they're up to. <br>
