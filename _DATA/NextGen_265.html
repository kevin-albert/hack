Captain's log, stardate 47423.9. We have arrived at Boraal Two in
response to an emergency distress call from Lieutenant Worf's foster
brother, Nikolai Rozhenko. He has been stationed on the planet as a
cultural observer.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Analysis. Mister Data. <br>
DATA: The planet's atmosphere is dissipating, sir. Intense plasmonic
reactions are destroying it. The stratosphere is already breaking down.
There are turbulent radiation storms across much of its surface. I
estimate that the planet will be uninhabitable in less than thirty
eight hours. <br>
RIKER: The distress call came in only four days ago. Why would Doctor
Rozhenko have waited so long before sending it? <br>
DATA: Atmospheric dissipation is a rare and essentially unpredictable
event. When it occurs, it proceeds rapidly. Doctor Rozhenko may not
have had sufficient warning. <br>
(ship shakes) <br>
PICARD: What was that? <br>
DATA: The dissipation effect is generating plasmonic energy bursts. <br>
RIKER: Is there any danger to the ship? <br>
DATA: I do not believe so. However, we may experience intermittent
system failures and power surges as a result. <br>
PICARD: Keep an eye on it. Mister Worf, any luck? <br>
WORF: There is still no response to our hails, sir. I am attempting to
scan the observation post. <br>
RIKER: He could be hurt. Maybe he can't respond. <br>
WORF: Sensor interference is significant, but the post appears to be
intact. Their power grid is still functioning. However, I am reading no
life forms within the structure. <br>
RIKER: It's not like him to the post. <br>
PICARD: Especially under these circumstances. <br>
WORF: Captain, I am detecting faint power emissions from a system of
caverns near the post. It could be a deflector shield. <br>
RIKER: That can't be native to the planet. The Boraalans don't have
anything close to that level of technology. <br>
WORF: Captain, request permission to lead an away team. <br>
PICARD: Very well. But regardless of this planet's immediate situation,
we must observe the Prime Directive. I want to minimise the risk of
contact with the inhabitants. You will go alone, Mister Worf, and I
want to have you surgically altered so that you could pass as a
Boraalan. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: You're worried about Nikolai, aren't you? <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
CRUSHER: Are the two of you close? <br>
WORF: We are brothers. <br>
CRUSHER: You never talk much about him. What's he like? <br>
WORF: Nikolai is older than I. We are not alike. We had many
disagreements when we were growing up. <br>
CRUSHER: That's not unusual. <br>
WORF: Nikolai has a mind of his own. He attended Starfleet Academy, but
he was unable to follow the rules. He left after one year. But he has
many fine qualities. He is brilliant, persuasive. A natural leader. <br>
CRUSHER: Sounds intriguing. I look forward to meeting him.

WORF: My name is Worf. I am a traveller. <br>
VORIN: How did you survive the storms? <br>
NIKOLAI: (a thick-set man) I would know that voice anywhere. Worf, is
it really you? It's good to see you. You've changed a lot in four
years. <br>
WORF: Nikolai? <br>
NIKOLAI: Yes. Oh, Worf. This is my brother, Worf. He's come to help us.

VORIN: But if you were able to get here, the storms must have subsided.
<br>
WORF: Please. <br>
VORIN: Do you think it's safe enough to return to the surface? <br>
WORF: Please, I must speak to my brother. <br>
(they move away from the locals) <br>
WORF: Nikolai, what have you done? <br>
NIKOLAI: They were dying. I refused to sit there safe in that
observation post and watch it happen. I set up a deflector shield to
screen these caves from the radiation and then I brought them here. <br>
WORF: What did you tell them? <br>
NIKOLAI: They think I'm a Boraalan. I told them I was from another
village far from here. <br>
WORF: At least you had that much sense. <br>
NIKOLAI: When I sent the distress call I knew the Enterprise was in
this sector, but I wasn't sure you'd be the one to come. I'm so glad
that you're here, Worf. <br>
WORF: Nikolai, there is nothing we can do for these people. You have
only postponed their deaths. <br>
NIKOLAI: I want to discuss that with your Captain. <br>
WORF: And I am certain he will want to speak with you. <br>
NIKOLAI: Friends, my brother and I must go back to the surface. He has
provisions and will need help bringing them here. We'll return shortly.
<br>
DOBARA: (or Cassidy Yates for DS9 fans)&nbsp; It's too dangerous.
The storms can occur without warning. If you're caught in one. <br>
NIKOLAI: Don't worry. Worf is a seer. He understands the nature of the
storms. He'll know when it's safe to travel. <br>
WORF: Yes, that is correct. <br>
KATERAS: Our seer died when the storms first came. We've been without
his guidance for many weeks. <br>
VORIN: Let me go with you. I know the terrain better than anyone and I
can help. <br>
NIKOLAI: No, Vorin. Worf and I will be safe. We'll return shortly.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Worf and Nikolai are back to their normal
appearances) <br>
PICARD: Doctor, you were fully aware that the atmospheric dissipation
could not be stopped. What did you hope to accomplish by assisting
these people? <br>
NIKOLAI: I was trying to give them a future. What I propose is we
create an atmospheric shield on the planet. We can camouflage the
equipment just as was done with my observation post. No one will ever
know it's there. <br>
RIKER: You can't be serious. <br>
NIKOLAI: Indeed I am. I realise it will only provide atmosphere for a
limited area on the surface, but it will be enough to save one village.
<br>
PICARD: I have no intention of compounding what you have done by
committing another gross violation of the Prime Directive. <br>
NIKOLAI: Captain, the Boraalans have a rich and beautiful culture, a
deep spiritual life. They deserve the chance to survive.
And isn't that what the Prime Directive was truly intended to do, to
allow cultures to survive and grow naturally? <br>
TROI: Not entirely. The Prime Directive was designed to ensure
non-interference. <br>
CRUSHER: But aren't we interfering either way? If we take no action,
it's a conscious decision to let the Boraalans die. <br>
NIKOLAI: Exactly. We have the power to save some of them. All we have
to do is exercise it. <br>
PICARD: We are sworn to uphold the principle of the Prime Directive,
and until that is changed there is no further course of action that we
can take. Is that understood? <br>
NIKOLAI: Some of my log recorders are still in my observation post.
They contain most of my research. Since it appears that the only way
I'm going to preserve Boraalan culture is in a museum, I request
permission to return to the surface and retrieve them. <br>
PICARD: I'm afraid that won't be possible. But you can have full use of
the ship's computer to set up a comm. link and upload your data from
here. If there's nothing further, you're dismissed. <br>
(all leave except Nikolai and Worf) <br>
WORF: I'm sorry, Nikolai. I wish there were another way. I am quite
familiar with your communications systems. If you like, I will help you
set up your comm. link. <br>
NIKOLAI: I'll do it myself.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Captain, atmospheric dissipation has
accelerated over the past several hours. I estimate the planet's
atmosphere will be completely gone within three minutes. <br>
NIKOLAI: Captain, I've completed my data uplink. With your permission,
I would like to integrate my research logs with the ship's library
computer. <br>
PICARD: Of course. <br>
DATA: The mesosphere is gone. Plasmonic reactions are now beginning to
break down the troposphere. <br>
PICARD: Put it on screen. <br>
(viewscreen goes out) <br>
PICARD: What's going on? <br>
DATA: It appears the plasmonic reactions are continuing to interfere
with our sensors. <br>
RIKER: I thought you had compensated for that. <br>
DATA: I had, sir. I will attempt to engage additional filtering
elements. Visual re-established. <br>
PICARD: This is one of those times when we must face the ramifications
of the Prime Directive and honour those lives which we cannot save. <br>
NIKOLAI: I find no honour in this whatsoever, Captain. You will forgive
me if I don't stay. <br>
(the atmosphere disappears) <br>
PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. <br>
(Picard leaves) <br>
RIKER: Helm, take us out of orbit. Set a course for Starbase eighty
seven, warp five. <br>
GATES: Aye, sir. <br>
(a science station blows up) <br>
RIKER: What happened? <br>
DATA: There appears to be an unusual power drain in the EPS
distribution net. <br>
RIKER: What's the source? <br>
DATA: Unknown, sir. It is difficult to localize. <br>
WORF: The power drain has registered on my security grid as well, sir.
It appears to be coming from deck ten. <br>
RIKER: All right, Mister Worf, get a security team on it.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NIKOLAI: I started thinking about this days ago
when it became clear the planet was doomed. I knew if I could get
access to your ship's computer, I could generate a replica of the
caves. The hard part was transporting the Boraalans into the holodeck
without anybody on the Enterprise noticing. But I was able to blank out
the sensors and make it look like interference from the plasmonic
bursts. And it worked, perfectly. The Boraalans were transported while
they were sleeping. They never knew anything had happened.

NIKOLAI: It's a simple plan, really. That's the beauty of it. Worf,
trust me. This is going to work. <br>
WORF: Trust you? You never had any intention of obeying the Captain. <br>
NIKOLAI: I wasn't going to let those people die just because your
Captain started quoting Federation dogma to me. <br>
WORF: Your duty was to respect the Captain's orders and to uphold the
Prime Directive. <br>
NIKOLAI: Duty. That's all that really matters to you, isn't it? Well, I
refuse to be bound by an abstraction. The lives of the people of Boraal
are far more important to me. You worry too much, Worf. You always did.
Everything will work out. <br>
WORF: You have disgraced yourself and you have disgraced me. I want
nothing more to do with you.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ready room]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: You realise your career is finished. <br>
NIKOLAI: I know that, Captain, and I would do it all again. <br>
PICARD: What do you expect us to do now? You have left us with a colony
of Boraalans who think they're still on their planet. <br>
NIKOLAI: I didn't beam them up without a plan. I've given this a lot of
thought. I think we can find a new planet, an M class world, that can
be their new home. <br>
PICARD: A home which would look very different from Boraal. You can't
really believe that they'll be fooled. <br>
NIKOLAI: That's where the holodeck comes in. I'll go back and tell the
Boraalans we're going on a journey, to a different place where they'll
be safe from the storms. The holodeck can gradually change the terrain
as we travel, so that at the end, the holodeck simulation will match
the conditions on the new planet. Then we'll simply beam them down. <br>
PICARD: What if it doesn't work? What if they become aware that
something strange is going on? <br>
NIKOLAI: Captain, I can't prepare for every contingency, but I assure
you I'm accustomed to thinking on my feet. I'll deal with the situation
as it evolves. <br>
PICARD: I'm not enthusiastic about this plan, but I don't see that we
have another option. Very well, let's give it a try. <br>
NIKOLAI: Thank you, Captain.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Stellar cartography]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: There are countless M class planets in
Federation space which can support the Boraalans. We need to narrow the
parameters. <br>
DATA: It will take approximately nine and one half hours to complete
the analysis. <br>
PICARD: Even then there's no guarantee that we'll find a suitable
planet. <br>
DATA: That is correct, sir. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, you'd better take a look at this. <br>
PICARD: What is it? <br>
LAFORGE: We've got a problem, sir. I don't think it's going to be
possible to keep this holodeck simulation stable. <br>
PICARD: Why not? <br>
LAFORGE: The plasmonic energy surges from the planet are affecting the
ship's systems. We're having problems with the EPS systems and the
power distribution matrix. <br>
NIKOLAI: And as a result, the holodeck imaging processor has been
severely destabilised. <br>
LAFORGE: It's not a question of whether the simulation will break down,
it's a question of when. <br>
PICARD: There's no way round it? <br>
LAFORGE: Not while it's running. In order to fix it, I'd have to shut
down all of the holodecks and re-initialise the entire system. <br>
PICARD: That will take hours. <br>
NIKOLAI: We'll just have to hope the simulation holds long enough. <br>
PICARD: Very well. Let's try it. Mister La Forge, I want you to monitor
the situation very carefully, and keep an open comm. link with the
Holodeck so as to be apprised of any problems. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. <br>
NIKOLAI: Captain, I'll return to the holodeck as soon as my surgical
alterations are completed and I'll prepare the Boraalans for their
journey. <br>
PICARD: Considering the situation you have put us in, I don't think
it's wise to leave you alone with those people. Mister Worf will
accompany you. <br>
WORF: Sir, perhaps someone else would be a better choice. Counsellor
Troi is familiar with <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, the Boraalans already know you. There's no need to
introduce them to anyone new. <br>

food. This is difficult to say, but you have a right to hear it. By the
time Worf and I had reached the surface, the village was gone. The
storms have destroyed everything. There is nothing for us to return to.
<br>
DOBARA: We can't survive in here. Our supplies won't last forever. <br>
NIKOLAI: That's why we must leave. There is a place far from here where
there are no storms. It will be a difficult journey, but in the end we
will have a new home. <br>
WORF: I know a way through the caves. We will travel safely until we
return to the surface. <br>
VORIN: Where is this new land? <br>
WORF: As we said, it is far from here. It will not be like the home you
knew. Even the stars may be different. <br>
VORIN: Why would they be different? And how do you know we'll be safe
there? <br>

here. <br>

CRUSHER: As well as can be expected. I've given him a mild sedative and
Troi's been speaking with him. And he seems much calmer. <br>
PICARD: Does he understand the situation? <br>
CRUSHER: I think so. <br>
PICARD: Contact Mister Worf. Make sure he knows what's going on. <br>
TROI: Here he is now. This is Captain Picard. <br>
PICARD: Vorin, isn't it? <br>
VORIN: Why did you bring us here? <br>
PICARD: Your planet was dying. It could no longer support life. We took
you away from it. <br>
VORIN: But we never left the caves. <br>
PICARD: We have the ability to create the illusion of other places,
like the caves on your planet. You have actually spent the last two
days here on this starship, not on Boraal. <br>
VORIN: Then our home is gone. <br>
TROI: Yes. <br>
PICARD: Vorin, listen to me. We can visit many other worlds. We can
take you to one where you can build a new life. <br>
VORIN: A new life? <br>
PICARD: A chance for your culture, your people, to survive and grow. <br>
VORIN: How can we grow when everything that made us who we are is gone?

NIKOLAI: Dobara, you go on ahead. <br>
WORF: I will carry your pack. Go and join the others. <br>
KATERAS: Thank you, seer. <br>
NIKOLAI: It'll be dark soon, in a few hours. Would you ask Mister La
Forge to create a suitable campsite for us a few kilometres from here?
What's wrong? <br>
WORF: Vorin has left the holodeck. <br>
NIKOLAI: How did he get out? <br>
WORF: I do not know, but Doctor Crusher cannot erase his memory. <br>
NIKOLAI: What will they do with him? <br>
WORF: They have explained the situation to him. He must make his own
decisions. <br>
NIKOLAI: Wait. Are you saying that if Vorin wants to come back in here,
they'll let him? <br>
WORF: That is right. He is not a prisoner. <br>
NIKOLAI: But if he comes back here and tells the others what he has
seen on the Enterprise, everything we have done will be for nothing. <br>
WORF: Then you should have considered that before you beamed them on
board. But you never think about the consequences of your acts. <br>
NIKOLAI: If you mean by that that I'm willing to do something while
others hesitate, that's true. <br>
WORF: Wherever you go, you create chaos. How many times did our parents
lie awake at night, wondering what kind of trouble you were in? <br>
NIKOLAI: Oh, if only I could have been like you. Worf, the perfect son.
<br>
WORF: I was not perfect, but I was not wild and disobedient. <br>
NIKOLAI: Of course not. You were too busy doing your duty. <br>
WORF: I would rather be accused of that than making our mother weep.
But I see it is clear you have no intention of changing. I see no
reason to discuss it further. </font></p>

WORF: It is an old argument. <br>
DOBARA: I've never seen him like this. He's usually so confident, so
sure of himself. But now he seems different. Do you know why? <br>
WORF: No. No, I do not. <br>
DOBARA: Ever since Vorin was lost, people have been afraid. Worried
that we won't reach our new home. We need Nikolai's strength now more
than ever. When the storms first came to our village, many of us were
ready to die. But Nikolai refused to let us. He gathered us together
and led us into caves. He saved us. He is a brave and compassionate
man, and I love him. Please, go to him. Make things right between you.
I want us to be a family. <br>
WORF: Us? <br>
DOBARA: Yes. I want you to consider yourself my brother. After all,
you're going to be the uncle of my child.

VORIN: I don't know. <br>
PICARD: If you tell them the truth, what will happen? Will they believe
you? <br>
VORIN: I'm not sure. It is a fantastic story. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps they will think that you have had an hallucination, or
that you're insane. <br>
VORIN: I don't think I would like to live my life knowing what I know
and being regarded as a madman. <br>
PICARD: On the other hand, they may believe your fantastic story. They
would learn about alien worlds, starships. <br>
VORIN: That would be disastrous. It would destroy everything they
believed in. I can't tell them the truth, but I don't think I can live
with a secret. <br>
