Captain's log, Stardate 43872.2. In order to neutralise a sudden
contamination of the water supply at the Federation colony on Beta Agni
Two, we are procuring one hundred and eight kilos of hytritium from the
Zibalian trader, Kivas Fajo. Because pure hytritium is too unstable for
our transporters, Lieutenant Commander Data has been shuttling the
material to the Enterprise.

PICARD: Hail the Jovis. I want to speak with Kivas Fajo. <br>
WORF: Sir, Mister Fajo is hailing us. <br>
PICARD: On viewer. <br>
FAJO [on viewscreen]: Captain Picard, what happened? <br>
PICARD: It's unclear. We're running a full analysis. <br>
FAJO [on viewscreen]: We detected no malfunctions before the explosion.
Everything seemed to be running as smoothly as the other flights. Were
you able to save the pilot? <br>
PICARD: No. <br>
FAJO [on viewscreen]: I'm sorry. <br>
PICARD: Mister Fajo, I would like to analyse your sensor readings of
the explosion. <br>
FAJO [on viewscreen]: Compared to the Enterprise's, our sensors are
rather primitive. I doubt they contain any information that your
sensors overlooked. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps, but I don't want to leave any avenue unexplored. <br>
FAJO [on viewscreen]: I understand. We'll transmit the information. <br>
WORF: Link established. Receiving. <br>
FAJO [on viewscreen]: Can we be of any further assistance? <br>
PICARD: How much hytritium did we manage to bring on board? <br>
RIKER: Eighty one kilos. <br>
LAFORGE: That will barely allow us to complete our mission, Captain,
but it leaves us no margin for error. <br>
PICARD: Mister Fajo, I realise we have acquired your complete supply of
hytritium. Do you know where we could obtain some more? <br>
FAJO [on viewscreen]: That may be difficult. The only source I know is
in the Sigma Erani system. <br>
RIKER: Three weeks away, sir. <br>
FAJO [on viewscreen]: And I can't guarantee they'll have any. For
obvious reasons, no one wants to keep it around. In fact, even I may
stop selling it. It's just too dangerous. <br>
RIKER: I guess we're fortunate you had any at all, sir. <br>
WORF: Captain, transfer of information complete. <br>
PICARD: Mister Fajo, thank you for your help. <br>
(transmission ends) <br>
PICARD: Mister Crusher, set a course for the Beta Agni Two system, warp
six. <br>
WESLEY: Aye, sir. <br>
RIKER: The Grissom is near the Sigma Erani system. I'll alert them to
stand by in case we need more hytritium. <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Number One. <br>
WESLEY: Course laid in, sir. <br>
PICARD: Engage.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(It's a large, clean room with ornamentation
arranged on display around the walls and a red circular seat in the
middle. The rigid Data is currently laid across it. He suddenly reboots
and sits up. His communicator is gone) <br>
DATA: What am I doing here? <br>
(Fajo and Varria enter) <br>
FAJO: Wondrous. The detail. The balance. Was I not right, Varria? What
a remarkable piece of work. <br>
DATA: Why have I been brought here? <br>
FAJO: The voice simulation. it's perfection. The inflections, the
timing. <br>
(Fajo snaps his fingers to test Data's responses, then speaks to him as
if Data does not understand English, complete with gestures) <br>
FAJO: It took great effort. Effort. to bring you here. I was sure he'd
be worth it. I was right. <br>
DATA: I've been delivered here against my wishes. I would like to know
the reason. <br>
FAJO: Certainly. You have been brought here for my enjoyment and my
appreciation. <br>
DATA: Am I to infer that you intend to keep me captive? <br>
FAJO: Captive? Captive? That's such an inappropriate description. My
dear android. May I call you Data? <br>
DATA: It is my name. <br>
FAJO: Data. You will be catered to, fawned over, cared for as you never
have been before. Your every wish will be fulfilled <br>
DATA: I wish to leave. <br>
FAJO: Almost every wish. <br>
DATA: This is unacceptable, sir. I have no desire to remain here and
even if I did, my Starfleet duties would not allow it. <br>
FAJO: It's so single minded, isn't it? <br>
VARRIA: Very persistent. <br>
FAJO: But it's very polite, which is a very nice touch. I decline to
allow you to go. <br>
DATA: Then I am forced to attempt escape. <br>
(Data tries to force the door open) <br>
FAJO: Ten androids just like you might be able to force that thing
open. But then again, there aren't any more just like you, are there?
It's keyed to galvanic skin responses and DNA patterns. Sorry. <br>
DATA: Then you will have to open it for me. <br>
(But as soon as Data gets to almost arms reach of Fajo, he is stopped
by a green forcefield. He tries again at a run and is thrown back
across the room) <br>
FAJO: Oh. Really, I wouldn't do that again if I were you. This is a
proximity-actuated field. It impedes positron flow.
It's very bad for the brainpaths in the long term. <br>
DATA: I fail to understand the value you place on my presence. <br>
FAJO: Well, just look around the room. There are items her gathered
from half the galaxy. Right here. This is the very first Basotile ever
created. (a sort of avant-guard sculpture) Sorry. (Fajo moves so Data
can see it) It's very, very ancient. Hundreds of years old. It's
priceless. <br>
(He goes past a beautiful porcelain urn on a stand to an orange
rectangular thing) <br>
FAJO: Come. This vase is made by Mark, the late Mark Off-Zel from
Sirrie Four. (painting) Dali. This is the only known Roger Maris
trading card from Earth circa 1962. The smell? Bubblegum. I've
preserved the scent. What? A Lapling. <br>
(A glove puppet with huge blue eyes in a case) <br>
DATA: I thought they were extinct. <br>
FAJO: Extinct? Good. That is what is generally believed. She is the
last surviving member of her species. They're very defenseless
creatures, really.
Everything that you see in the room here, everything. One of its kind.
Unique. All original. Just as you are. There. (a chair) That is your
place of honour. Sit, sit. Sit! You think perhaps it might be
uncomfortable? But then again, you don't give a thought to comfort, do
you. (to Varria) When Palor Toff learns of that, he'll swallow his
tongue with envy. I can't wait to see his face. You are the crown jewel
of my
collection. You're a treasure beyond comparison. <br>
(The comm. beeps) <br>
VARRIA: Yes, go ahead. <br>
FAJO: I think you should be flattered. <br>
DATA: I am not, sir. Most intelligent lifeforms find involuntary
confinement offensive and inequitable. Moreover, you have
violated Federation law <br>
FAJO: I know, I know. What I've done is evil, selfish, immoral,
unprincipled, illegal. Well, I've learned to live with it. <br>
VARRIA: The Andorians wish to make a bid on the shipment of Tellurian
spices you offered. <br>
FAJO: They've had four days to decide! Why do they have to decide
right! Sorry. <br>
DATA: I must emphasize, Mister Fajo, that I consider this captivity a
hostile act on your part. <br>
FAJO: You'll get used to it.

quite finished. <br>
LAFORGE: You know what a critic Data was, especially about his own

DATA: Mister Fajo is deluding himself if he believes he can keep me
here. The Enterprise is certain to find me. <br>
VARRIA: They're not even looking for you. They think you're destroyed.
Your shuttle blew up. A hytritium explosion. <br>

your component elements. We put them aboard the shuttle in just the

here. <br>
VARRIA: Mister Fajo has no moral difficulties at all. <br>

VARRIA: Clever, android. Is it part of your programme to seek out
vulnerabilities in your enemies? <br>
DATA: Yes. Are you my enemy? <br>
VARRIA: I obey Fajo. And so does everyone on this ship. <br>
DATA: Why? <br>
VARRIA: You are a curious thing, aren't you? <br>
DATA: Do you object to the question? <br>
VARRIA: Kivas finds a way to get what he wants from his people. His
rewards for loyalty are lavish. His punishments for disloyalty are
equally lavish. You won't find anyone here on this ship to help you
escape. Face it, android. He has you. <br>

LAFORGE: Captain, it's not only hard to accept, with Data it's
impossible. I mean, I can't even begin to calculate the odds. If Data
were here, we could ask him. <br>
PICARD: What are you suggesting, Lieutenant? <br>
LAFORGE: I don't know, sir. It just doesn't make sense, and I like
things to make sense, that's all. <br>
RIKER: Geordi, maybe if you get a little rest and came at this thing
fresh. <br>
LAFORGE: A little rest isn't going to change the computer analysis,
Commander. <br>
PICARD: I'm sure you have done a complete investigation, and if you
wish to continue it, of course you have my support. But we shall be
reaching the Beta Agni system shortly, and I expect you to be rested. <br>
LAFORGE: I understand, sir. <br>
PICARD: Dismissed. Geordi, I understand how much we want, even need, to
explain an accident like this. Sometimes there just aren't any
explanations. <br>

RIKER: For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them
in others. <br>

FAJO: You are still wearing that uniform. Why? <br>
DATA: I am a Starfleet officer. <br>
FAJO: You are not in Starfleet any longer. It's time you adjusted your
programme
to accept reality. <br>
DATA: Even if I chose to do so, it is doubtful that my programming
could be sufficiently altered to accede to your wishes. <br>
FAJO: Oh? <br>
DATA: I have been designed with a fundamental respect for life in all
its forms and a strong inhibition against causing harm to living
beings. <br>
FAJO: What a marvellous contradiction. A military pacifist. Tell me,
whose dreadful decision was it to enlist you in Starfleet to begin
with? <br>
DATA: My skills seemed appropriate <br>
FAJO: Data, Data, Data. Big mistake. A grievous error. You belong in
Starfleet about as much as I belong in a verbal contract. Tell me, have
you killed yet? <br>
DATA: No, but I am programmed with the ability to use deadly force in
the cause of defense. <br>
FAJO: Shame on you. Shame on you. How neatly you rationalise your
capabilities. How can you just casually accept your role in murder? <br>
DATA: I would not participate in murder. Perhaps you misunderstand. <br>
FAJO: Can't you see how much better it will be for you right here? The
intellectual rewards alone. Our personal exploration of the
galaxy. I am at war with no one. I am your liberator. <br>
DATA: You are a fine debater, sir. It is a pity you have used your
verbal gifts for mere hucksterism and the advancement of your own
greed. <br>
FAJO: Perhaps. Perhaps you would not judge me so harshly if you knew of
my desperate youth, wasted, wasted on the streets of Zimballia. <br>
DATA: Your past does not excuse unethical or immoral behaviour, sir. <br>
FAJO: Well, it doesn't matter. It isn't true anyway. My father was
quite wealthy, actually. He was a thief. Data, why don't you put on
these lovely new clothes and sit on the chair. <br>
DATA: I must decline. <br>
FAJO: You are going to be much more of a challenge than I had first
thought. (goes to replicator) Finoplak, one hundred denkirs. (A vial of
liquid appears) Now, Data, in the meantime, here is something for your
logic circuits to analyse. <br>
(Fajo thrown the liquid onto Data's uniform, which begins to smoke and
dissolve) <br>
FAJO: Oh, don't worry. The solvent won't harm your, your skin. But in
seconds it will completely dissolve that uniform. Personally, I'd be
delighted to see you go around naked. I assume you have no modesty.
But, then, I guess that decency is the rule of your Starfleet training.
In any case, Data, why don't you make a decision about which
alternative you dislike the least. Make a decision by dinnertime
tonight. I have invited a guest to meet you, and I expect you to be as
entertaining with him as you have been with me.

wonder if this is one of the copies Doctor Who wrote 'this is a fake'
on?) <br>
FAJO: I would very much like our relationship to change. <br>
DATA: You may expect me to use every means at my disposal to resist
your wishes. <br>
FAJO: Why can't you just comply? Why do you argue all the time?
Couldn't you just go sit on the chair? Come on. Go on, sit on the
chair. <br>
DATA: I do not intend to sit in the chair. <br>
FAJO: You will. You may believe it right now, but you will. <br>
(There is a wall safe behind one of his display items, a necklace. Fajo
tries to hide the combination from Data, then removes a gun) <br>
FAJO: Have you ever seen one of these, Data? <br>
DATA: It is a disruptor. <br>
FAJO: Well, no. It's a prototype for a Varon-T disruptor. <br>
DATA: The Varon-T disruptor is banned in the Federation. <br>
FAJO: Oh, yes. They only manufactured five of them. I own four. I sleep
with one under my pillow at night, and I sleep very well knowing it's
there too. Do you know why? <br>
DATA: It is a most lethal weapon. <br>
FAJO: It's not just lethal. It's vicious. It tears a body apart, inside
out, and very slowly too by your phaser standards. It's tortuous. A
very, very painful death. I've always wanted to try this. <br>
DATA: It is doubtful you will destroy me since you assign so much value
to possessing me. <br>
FAJO: That goes without saying. Please come in. <br>
(Varria enters) <br>
FAJO: Varria, how long have we been together, my dear? <br>
VARRIA: Fourteen years. <br>
FAJO: Fourteen wonderful years they were too. She was barely an adult
when I found her. She was idealistic, naive, full of dreams. And I made
those dreams come true, too, didn't I? I'm going to miss you. <br>
(Fajo points the disruptor at Varria) <br>

the water) <br>
CRUSHER: The contamination's been neutralised. The water's clean. <br>
WORF: Curious. The process of neutralisation should have taken several
hours. Naturally
occurring tricyanate does not respond this quickly. <br>
RIKER: Are you saying it's not naturally occurring? <br>
WORF: There are no natural trace elements present in these tricyanate
crystals. <br>
RIKER: If it's artificial, then we're talking about sabotage. <br>
CRUSHER: With tricyanate? That's hard to believe. It's slow to
assimilate, difficult to replicate, and hard to transport. There are a
lot easier ways to poison a water supply. More effective ways too. <br>
RIKER: Can you think of any reason a saboteur would choose tricyanate? <br>
CRUSHER: It might pass for a natural disaster. And since there's only
one way to treat it, with hytritium, maybe somebody figured we couldn't
locate it. It is hard to find. <br>
RIKER: Then it really was lucky, wasn't it, that we were able to find
hytritium when we did. And just enough hytritium for this crisis? </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Fajo was in the right place at the right
time just when we needed him most. <br>
PICARD: You're suggesting he created the problem just to solve it? <br>
RIKER: Possibly. <br>
LAFORGE: What, to make a profit from his sale of hytritium? <br>
CRUSHER: It doesn't add up. The cost of producing tricyanate is very
expensive. He wouldn't make a profit on it. Quite the contrary. <br>
WORF: Then, why would he do it? <br>
RIKER: What could he want? <br>
PICARD: Computer, biographical file on trader Kivas Fajo. <br>
COMPUTER: Accessing file Kivas Fajo. A Zibalian trader of the Stacius
trade guild, educated on Iraaten Five. A noted collector of rare and
valuable objects including the Rejac Crystal, the Starry Night by Van
Gogh, the Lawmim Galactopedia, the Moliam Andi tapestries <br>
PICARD: Computer, that is sufficient. <br>
RIKER: A rare and valuable object? <br>
LAFORGE: What if Data wasn't on that shuttle? <br>
PICARD: Mister Crusher. <br>
WESLEY [OC]: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Set course for the site of the shuttlepod explosion. Warp
eight. <br>
WESLEY [OC]: Aye, sir. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WESLEY: The Jovis has a maximum speed of warp
three. He's had twenty three hours so we can define a perimeter of
point one oh two light years as his possible distance. <br>
RIKER: Fajo doesn't know that we're onto him, so he probably isn't
taxing his engines at top speed. <br>
WESLEY: He could have made it to the Nel Bato system, or maybe even the
Giles Belt. <br>
PICARD: He's a trader. He doesn't attract customers by being hard to
find. <br>
RIKER: We could put out a coded level two query to all Federation
outposts within the perimeter. <br>
PICARD: Make it so.

VARRIA: If I help you escape, will you take me with you? He's sleeping,
and there isn't much time.<br>
DATA: The consequences if we are caught <br>
VARRIA: I know the consequences. Fourteen years. You learn a few
things. There's an escape pod in the aft cargo bay. <br>

Lya Four. <br>
RIKER: Fajo spent more than half a day in orbit. Departed just over
seven hours ago. <br>
PICARD: Mister Crusher, new coordinates. Lay in a course for Lya Four. <br>
WESLEY: Coordinates already laid in, sir.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Perhaps I should attempt to communicate with
the Enterprise. <br>
VARRIA: You can't. Fajo has communications access restricted to the
bridge. Once we're out, the shuttlepod will emit an emergency beacon.
We'll just have to hope somebody responds before Fajo is able to
destroy us. <br>
DATA: I am trained in evasive manoeuvres. <br>
VARRIA: We'll need a few. Let's get going. As soon as I start the
escape sequence, an alarm will sound. We won't have much time. <br>
(Data gets in the pod, Varria goes to a control station and presses
buttons. The alarm sounds, a man runs in. She points the disrupter at
him, then is jumped from behind by another crewman and disarmed. Man
number one cancels the sequence while Data rescues Varria. Data ends up
throwing both men across the bay. They go to start again, when Fajo
enters. The disrupter is lying on the floor. Varria dives for it but
lands short. Fajo aims another disrupter at her. For a moment, he
starts to turn away, then fires. Varria screams for several seconds
before she finally disintegrates. Data comes out of the pod) <br>
FAJO: It's your fault. You knew the price for disobedience. And so did
she. Well, there's always another Varria. <br>
(Data picks up the disrupter and points it at Fajo) <br>
FAJO: You won't hurt me. Fundamental respect for all living beings.
That is what you said. I'm a living being, therefore you can't harm me.
<br>
DATA: You will surrender yourself to the authorities. <br>
FAJO: Or what? You'll fire? Empty threat and we both know it. Why don't
you accept your fate? You will return to your chair and you will sit
there. You will entertain me and you will entertain my guests. And if
you do not, I will simply kill somebody else. Him, perhaps. It doesn't
matter. Their blood will be on your hands too, just like poor Varria's.
Your only alternative, Data, is to fire. Murder me. That's all you have
to do. Go ahead. Fire. If only you could feel rage over Varria's death.
If only you could feel the need for revenge, then maybe you could fire.
But you're just an android. You can't feel anything, can you? It's just
another interesting intellectual puzzle for you. Another of life's
curiosities. <br>
DATA: I cannot permit this to continue. <br>
(He levels the disrupter at Fajo again) <br>
FAJO: Wait. Your programme won't allow you to fire. You cannot fire.
No. <br>

DATA: Yes, Commander. Please arrange to take Kivas Fajo into custody on
charges of murder, kidnapping, theft. <br>
RIKER: The arrangements have already been made. <br>

FAJO: Just don't count me out too quickly. I had you in my collection
