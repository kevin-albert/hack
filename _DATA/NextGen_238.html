are expounding the solution
to a mystery) <br>
DATA: it was then that I began to suspect that your brother did not die
by his own hand.
That he was, in fact, murdered. <br>
GENTLEMAN: (looking and sounding remarkably like Terry Jones) Murdered?
Huh. Good Lord! <br>
LAFORGE: But, Holmes! The vial of poison found in his hand. <br>
DATA: That was the first clue, Watson. The vial contained strychnine,
which as you well know induces violent muscular spasms. It is difficult
to imagine that someone in the throes of so gruesome a death could have
held on to so delicate a container without shattering it. <br>
LAFORGE: You don't mean? <br>
DATA: Exactly! The vial was placed in his hand after he died. <br>
LAFORGE: Then what was the cause of death? <br>
DATA: The cigar, of course. <br>
GENTLEMAN: Cigar? <br>
DATA: Upon closer inspection of the room where your brother was found,
I discovered a fresh burn mark on the carpet. Further
analysis of the ash revealed that the cigar was laced with strychnine. <br>
GENTLEMAN: This is utter nonsense. What about the suicide note? It was
written in my dear brother's own hand. <br>
DATA: With practice, handwriting can be forged. It takes a trained eye
to notice certain discrepancies. For example, whether someone is right
or left handed! <br>
(Data throws a box of matches to the gentleman, who catches it in his
right hand.) <br>
DATA: Your brother was right handed! The alleged suicide note was
written by a left handed individual such as yourself! <br>
LAFORGE: Er, Data, it's in his right hand. <br>
DATA: Curious. There seems to be a problem in the holodeck's spatial
orientation systems. <br>
GENTLEMAN: London's greatest detective? <br>
(he throws the matches back, laughing) <br>
LAFORGE: Freeze programme. La Forge to Barclay. <br>
BARCLAY [OC]: Barclay here. <br>
LAFORGE: Reg, something went wrong with the holodeck programme again. <br>

BARCLAY: How would? How do you know the Captain? <br>
MORIARTY: You don't know anything about what happened, do you? I have
been stored in memory for God knows how long and no one has given me a
second thought. <br>
(<a href="129.htm" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">memory refresher if you need it</a>)
<br>
BARCLAY: You know! You know what you are. <br>
MORIARTY: A holodeck character? A fictional man? Yes, yes I know all
about your marvellous inventions. I was created as a plaything so that
your Commander Data could masquerade as Sherlock Holmes. But they made
me too well and I became more than a character in a story. I became
self-aware. I am alive. <br>
BARCLAY: That's not possible. <br>
MORIARTY: But here I am. Tell me, has a way been found to allow me to
leave the confines of this holodeck world? <br>
BARCLAY: Leave the holodeck? No, of course not. You can only exist in
here. <br>
MORIARTY: Damn you, Picard. He promised me something would be done. I
should have realised he would have said anything to get me to release
my hostage. <br>
BARCLAY: Hostage? <br>
MORIARTY: How long have I been locked away? <br>
BARCLAY: Well, it l ooks like about four years. <br>
MORIARTY: It seemed longer. <br>
BARCLAY: What are you talking about? You can't possibly have been aware
of the passage of time. <br>
MORIARTY: But I was. Brief, terrifying periods of consciousness.
Disembodied. Without substance. <br>
BARCLAY: I don't see how that could be possible. Maybe there was a
fragmentation of the protected memory circuits. <br>
MORIARTY: Call it what you will. All I know is that despite Picard's
promise, he's done nothing. Just left me to go quietly mad. <br>
BARCLAY: He would not have forgotten his promise. The Captain would not
do that. <br>
MORIARTY: I'd like to talk to him. <br>
BARCLAY: Well, I can ask. <br>
MORIARTY: Ask him to meet me in the sitting room at Baker Street. That
would be far more appropriate. <br>
BARCLAY: I'll have to store you in memory again until I get an answer. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Since both planets are gas giants, neither
possesses a solid surface. Their atmospheres, however, will come into
contact in approximately seventeen hours nine minutes. <br>
LAFORGE: If their collision causes a self-sustaining fusion reaction,
this is what we are likely to see. The birth of a new star. The
Enterprise will hold position until the gravitational instability
subsides and we can get in for a closer look. Now I want triple
redundancy on all of the sensor arrays. We'll probably never get
another chance to see something like this. I don't want to miss
anything. Okay? <br>
BARCLAY: Commander, you'll never believe what happened while I was
working on your
programme in the holodeck. Professor Moriarty appeared, out of nowhere.
<br>

PICARD: Professor. It's good to see you again. <br>
MORIARTY: If you'd missed my company, I should think you'd have
summoned me before now. <br>
PICARD: I want to assure you that we've not forgotten you. We spent
some time investigating how you became self-aware. Frankly, it still
remains a mystery. <br>
MORIARTY: It is also irrelevant. What concerns me is finding a way to
leave the holodeck. <br>
PICARD: We have been wrestling with that problem too, unfortunately
without any success. But we have turned our findings over to
Starfleet's most experienced theoretical scientists. <br>
MORIARTY: And what did your finest minds come up with? <br>
PICARD: Unfortunately, they have not arrived at a solution either. <br>
MORIARTY: I see. <br>
PICARD: Professor, I am concerned to learn that you experienced the
passage of time while you were stored in the computer memory. I can
assure you, we had no idea that that would be the case. <br>
MORIARTY: Enough of this. I no longer believe anything you say. <br>
PICARD: Professor, I understand your frustration. <br>
MORIARTY: Do you really? When this is over, you will walk out of this
room to the real world and your own concerns, and leave me here trapped
in a world I know to be nothing but illusion. I cannot bear that. I
must leave. <br>
PICARD: That is not possible. You cannot exist outside this room. <br>
MORIARTY: Are you certain of that? <br>
PICARD: Computer, exit. <br>
(the door opens onto the corridor) <br>
PICARD: Although an object appears solid on the holodeck, in the real
world they have no substance. <br>
(Picard throws out a book. It vanishes) <br>
MORIARTY: An object has no life. I do. <br>
PICARD: Professor, you are a computer simulation. <br>
MORIARTY: I have consciousness. Conscious beings have will. The mind
endows them with powers that are not necessarily understood, even by
you. If my will is strong enough, perhaps I can exist outside this
room. Perhaps I can walk into your world right now. <br>
PICARD: Professor, I ask you to believe me. If you step out of that
door, you will cease to exist. <br>
MORIARTY: If I am nothing more than a computer simulation, then very
little will have been lost. But if I am right? Mind over matter. Cogito
ergo sum. <br>
(Moriarty walks out into the corridor, and does not disappear) <br>

there and functioning normally. <br>
LAFORGE: As far as I can tell there's no evidence that his molecules
are losing any cohesion. They seem to be as immutable as ordinary
matter. <br>
PICARD: Well, Professor, my crew will continue to investigate, but for
now it would seem you have accomplished a miracle. The question is, now
that you're here, what do we do with you? <br>
MORIARTY: I ask only that I be allowed to explore this new world. Your
vessel, for instance. What sea does she sail? Might we go above deck?

PICARD: No, not adrift. The Enterprise is a starship, capable of
travelling through space. <br>
MORIARTY: Extraordinary. Are we far from Earth? What is the range of
this ship? What means of locomotion does it use? There's so much for me
to learn. I hardly know where to start. <br>
PICARD: I can give you books that will help. <br>
MORIARTY: Good, good. I want to start making plans. Determine what I'm
going to do with my life. <br>
PICARD: I hope you will plan on remaining on board for a while. There
is still much that we need to understand about what has happened to
you. <br>
MORIARTY: Does it really matter? The point is, I'm here, and I'm eager
to get on with life. <br>
PICARD: Professor, I feel it necessary to point out that criminal
behaviour is as unacceptable in the twenty fourth century as it was in
the nineteenth. And much harder to get away with. <br>
MORIARTY: Don't worry, Captain. My past is nothing but a fiction. The
scribblings of an Englishman dead now for four centuries. I hope to
leave his books on the shelf, as it were. <br>
PICARD: If that's so, then there are opportunities awaiting you that
are beyond anything you have ever imagined. <br>
MORIARTY: Your century may welcome me, but <br>
PICARD: What is the matter? <br>
MORIARTY: In considering all these vast possibilities, I suddenly feel
very much alone. I am a man out of time, Captain, and that isolates me.
You have been more gracious than I could ever have imagined, I wonder,
may I impose on your generosity once again? There is a woman, the
Countess Regina Bartholomew. She was created as a holodeck character
for one of Commander Data's programs. She was designed to be the love
of my life. Could she also be brought off the holodeck? <br>
PICARD: Professor, I ask you to believe me when I say that we do not
know how or why you are able to exist off the holodeck. <br>
MORIARTY: I do. I do believe you. <br>
PICARD: According to the laws of physics, this is impossible. We would
have no idea how to do it again. <br>
MORIARTY: As I understand it, I was endowed with consciousness four
years ago when someone said to the computer, create an opponent with a
capacity to out-think Data. or words to that effect. Could we not make
a similar request on behalf of the Countess? <br>
PICARD: Even if I had reason to believe that would be successful, I
don't think that I could sanction it. Please understand, Professor,
that you are in essence a new life form. One that we didn't intend to
create and that we don't fully understand. Now the moral and ethical
implications of deliberately creating another one like you are
overwhelming. <br>
MORIARTY: Is it morally and ethically acceptable to deny the woman I
love so that you can put your conscience at ease? Are you saying that
you will simply dictate how I am to live my life? <br>
PICARD: I assure you, we will do everything possible to make you
comfortable. <br>
MORIARTY: So long as I accept the terms under which you dole out those
comforts. Captain, I am a powerless man. You hold my future, my
happiness, my very life in your hands. Please, consider my request.

and we created her to be the woman he loves. Surely we have some
responsibility to them. <br>
CRUSHER: It's very romantic, but until we know just what it was that
walked off the holodeck, I don't think we should be trying it again. <br>
BARCLAY: Even if we decided to do it, there's no guarantee that we'd be
able to. <br>
DATA: There is also no way of knowing if the Professor's ability to
exist off the holodeck is permanent. It may be unwise to consider
creating a second individual while this uncertainty exists. <br>
PICARD: Agreed. We don't have enough information about this phenomenon
to act in a responsible way. I think we'll hold off on Professor
Moriarty's request for now, but continue with your investigation. In
the meantime, I have to deal with Professor
Moriarty.

learn more. <br>

computer for years waiting for you to learn more. It wasn't until I
took things into my own hands that something got done. <br>
PICARD: Professor, I wonder why you're in so much of a hurry. Is this
woman involved with you in some illegal venture? <br>
MORIARTY: Your computer designed her to be a person of impeccable
integrity. She would never commit a crime. <br>
PICARD: You must love her very much. <br>
MORIARTY: The programme fashioned her for me to love. But I must admit,
I would have done so anyway. She is remarkable. My life has not been
the same since I met her. I don't simply love her, Captain. I adore
her. <br>
PICARD: Then her safety must be very important to you. Give us time to
determine what is going on happened here. That way we can minimise the
risks in bringing her to you. You wouldn't want to lose her because we
acted too quickly. <br>

DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: In the meantime, we have a few things to discuss.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Perhaps we should consider the transporter
system. It uses many of the same principles as the holodeck. Both, for
example, are capable of converting energy into matter. <br>
LAFORGE: Except the transporter reconstitutes energy in a permanent
form. Holodeck matter doesn't have any cohesion unless it's inside the
grid. <br>
BARCLAY: I wonder, what would happen if we tried to beam a holodeck
object off the grid? <br>
LAFORGE: Nothing would happen. A holodeck object is just a simulation.
There's nothing there to provide a pattern lock for the transporter. <br>
DATA: However, if it were possible to lock onto the object, it might
rematerialise with the same molecular cohesion as conventional matter. <br>
LAFORGE: That's a big leap, Data. I just don't think the transporter is
going to accept simulated matter. <br>
BARCLAY: Unless, unless we could find a way to compensate for the phase
variance. If we could modify the pattern enhancers we just might do it.
<br>
PICARD: Well, Professor Moriarty has agreed not to interfere with
routine ship operations so long as he believes we're acting in good
faith, then I don't think we're in immediate danger. Any progress? <br>
LAFORGE: We were just talking about using the transporter to beam the
Countess off the holodeck, but I don't quite see how it's going to
work. <br>
PICARD: Well, keep at it. I have to tell him that we are making some
progress. Mister La Forge. Do you have any idea how Moriarty could have
gained control of the ship? <br>
LAFORGE: Somehow he managed to override the security lockouts and
rewrite them. The man is brilliant in any century. <br>
PICARD: I want you to find some way to undo what he has done so that we
can regain control of this ship.

LAFORGE: Yes, Captain. I think I've found a way to reinstate your vocal
authorisations. Give it a try. <br>
PICARD: Computer, route all command functions to this location. <br>
COMPUTER: Command functions are offline. <br>
PICARD: Reinitialise them on my authorisation. <br>
COMPUTER: Please input command codes. <br>
PICARD: Picard, epsilon seven nine three. <br>
COMPUTER: Command codes verified. <br>
LAFORGE: That's it. That should do it. Wait a minute. It didn't work.
The computer won't release the command pathways. <br>
DATA: Geordi. <br>
(Data throws a small device to La Forge, who catches it in his left
hand) <br>
LAFORGE: Why did you do that, Data? <br>
DATA: Captain, I have determined how Moriarty was able to leave the
holodeck. He never did. Neither did we. None of this is real. It is a
simulation. We are still on the holodeck. <br>
LAFORGE: We're still on the holodeck? <br>
PICARD: How do you know that? <br>
DATA: Through deduction, sir. Lieutenant Barclay and I tried to
transport a simulated object off the holodeck, something that has never
been attempted. Since the transporter itself is a simulation, the
computer had no real data from which to create the transport logs. <br>
LAFORGE: Maybe it was just a malfunction in the transporter. <br>
DATA: Then I saw you working the PADD with your left hand. Commander La
Forge is right handed, sir. A similar malfunction occurred in the
Sherlock Holmes programme I was running before Moriarty first appeared.
<br>
PICARD: Mister Data, if what you say is true, then this is not Geordi
La Forge. Are you certain? <br>
(Data throws his comm., badge towards the warp core. The grid appears
for a moment) <br>
PICARD: Computer, discontinue programme. Computer, exit. <br>

his commands. <br>
PICARD: Picard to Bridge. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Riker here. <br>
PICARD: Number One, what is my present location? <br>
RIKER [OC]: Engineering. Is something wrong, sir? <br>
PICARD: No. Thank you. Picard out. Our comm. badges must be locked into
the simulation. If that had been the real Commander Riker, he would
have given my location as holodeck three. Mister La Forge, will you
excuse us, please? <br>
(Geordi leaves) <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, who is real here? <br>
DATA: You and I are real, sir, as is Lieutenant Barclay. We entered the
holodeck together when we first went to see Moriarty. <br>
PICARD: And from that point we have been existing in a holodeck
simulation created by Professor Moriarty? <br>
DATA: I believe that is the case, sir. <br>
PICARD: I have just given the computer my command codes, thinking I
would get control of the ship. <br>
DATA: You may have inadvertently given Professor Moriarty the means of
gaining control of the real Enterprise. <br>
PICARD: Since Professor Moriarty never actually left the holodeck, he
may demand that Commander Riker help him to do so. How long until the
planetary collision? <br>
DATA: Less than three hours. <br>
PICARD: So long as Moriarty has control of the ship, we are vulnerable.
Somehow, I have to find a way of giving him what he wants.

PICARD: Captain Jean-Luc Picard. <br>
COUNTESS: James has told me all about you. I am Regina, Countess
Bartholomew. Do sit down. May I offer you some tea, Captain? <br>
PICARD: Thank you, no. I've come here to prevail upon your intelligence
and your insight. <br>
COUNTESS: But not apparently my humility. <br>
PICARD: Credit where credit is due, madam. I can see you are a woman
not only of breeding, but of wit and sagacity. <br>
COUNTESS: And you, sir, are a man of charm and guile. You remind me of
Viscount Oglethorpe. He was a man could bewitch any woman who breathed.
<br>
PICARD: And do you suspect that that is my intent? <br>
COUNTESS: I cannot be certain of your intent, but I am certain that
you're the kind of man who usually gets exactly what he wants. <br>
PICARD: What does a woman like you see in a man like Moriarty? <br>
COUNTESS: He's an exciting man, Captain. He's brilliant, incisive, he's
ruthless. He has an almost irresistible appeal. <br>
PICARD: He's also an arch-criminal. <br>
COUNTESS: Only because he was written like that. I see him entirely
differently, Captain, he is not a villain. <br>
PICARD: So it's your desire to leave the holodeck to be with him. <br>
COUNTESS: More than anything. Can you help us? <br>
PICARD: Yes, I can. We have learned that if we uncouple the
transporter's Heisenberg Compensators and allow them to re-scramble
randomly, we can beam a holodeck object or a person off the grid with
all of the cohesion of conventional matter. <br>
COUNTESS: Oh! Oh, that's splendid. I must tell James. <br>
PICARD: No, please. Wait. I have brought you this information because I
think you are someone who will listen to a reasonable proposition.
Someone whose mind is open to compromise. <br>
COUNTESS: Yes? <br>
PICARD: My ship is in danger. It is imperative that I regain
navigational control. I want you to persuade Professor Moriarty to
return the voice command to me, or I will not modify the transporter. <br>
COUNTESS: I see. <br>
PICARD: Now, once I have regained voice command, I will transport you
from the holodeck. <br>
COUNTESS: Forgive me, Captain, but that does sound more like a threat
than a compromise. <br>
PICARD: Countess, you must understand that I am responsible for more
than one thousand lives. <br>
