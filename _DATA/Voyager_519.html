<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(A blue-skinned reptiloid enters nervously.)<br>SAOWIN:
Hello? Hello? I'm here! Hello? <br>(He passes a vertical tank containing a giant sea-slug. Another being touches his shoulder.)<br>SAOWIN: I'm here to see Mister Kurros. Could you? <br>
(This being is brown and makes unintelligible noises before walking away.) <br>
SAOWIN: Could you tell me where to find Mister Kurros? <br>(A sleek machine beeps at him.)<br>SAOWIN: Wait! <br>(The
place shudders slightly as a giant water-dweller moves in his tank
beyond the wall. A small humanoid in a long gown speaks gently.)<br>
KURROS: Do not mind Bevvox. He can be grouchy in the morning. Welcome
aboard. <br>
SAOWIN: Thank you. <br>
KURROS: You seem tense. <br>
SAOWIN: No. <br>
KURROS: This is a time for celebration. The geostability of your world
has been restored, your people saved. And all because you had the
wisdom to accept our help. <br>
SAOWIN: You accomplished in days what our scientists failed to achieve
in decades. <br>
KURROS: That it not to say it was not a challenge. Finding the precise
harmonic for a planetary containment field did put my colleague here to
the test. <br>(Kurros turns to the sea-slug.)<br>KURROS: But in the end, she prevailed. <br>
SAOWIN: We owe you our lives. <br>
KURROS: Solving problems is what we do. And seeing the look of
gratitude in your eyes is almost reward enough. Almost. <br>
SAOWIN: I have some bad news. Our bernicium mines were destroyed in the
last series of quakes. The ore's buried under sixty gigatons of rock.
We can't get to it. We hoped you'd accept this instead. A rubidium
geode. Priceless. The only one ever found on our planet. <br>
KURROS: It is rare, but hardly unique. And it is not what we agreed
upon. <br>
SAOWIN: I'm sorry, this is all we can offer you. <br>
KURROS: You are lying. The mines collapsed, but before they did you
transferred the ore to a shielded storage facility. Needless to say, we
detected it. <br>
SAOWIN: Please, we need the ore to repair our replicator systems.
Without it, we'll be unable to feed our people. <br>
KURROS: Get it to us now, or I will deactivate the containment field.
Have you ever experienced a level twelve seismic event? Most violent.
Quite unnerving. <br>
SAOWIN: No! I'll have the ore transported at once. This, this was all a
misunderstanding. <br>
KURROS: Of course. It is already forgotten, my friend. Perhaps we will
do business again someday. <br>
SAOWIN: Yes. <br>
KURROS: Show our friend back to his shuttle. I would hate for him to
get lost in such an unfamiliar place. <br>(Saowin bows himself out, bumping into the sea-slug's tank.)<br>
SAOWIN: Oh! Pardon me. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Yes? <br>
SEVEN: Captain, long range scans have detected. <br>
JANEWAY: One second. I've wasted two hours on this thing and I'm no
closer to solving it. <br>(It
is a large object with at least six hexagonal sides and a couple of
squares. The hexagons have a honeycomb of lights on them. Like a
complicated Rubik's cube, I suppose.)<br>
SEVEN: You can thank Ensign Paris for introducing the artefact to the
ship. <br>
JANEWAY: He was behind the last ship wide craze, too. Yo-yos. Now it's
Sheer Lunacy. Another hour and I'll go insane. <br>
SEVEN: The solution is quite simple. If you align <br>
JANEWAY: No, I want to figure this out myself. (But she only gets some of the lights to work.)<br>JANEWAY: You said something about
long range scans? <br>
SEVEN: They've revealed a planetoid with high concentrations of
dilithium crystals. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's take a look.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM: Got
it! False alarm. <br>(Kim is also working on a Sheer Lunacy.)<br>
PARIS: Keep at it, Harry. <br>
SEVEN: We're within visual range. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. <br>
TUVOK: Initial scans reveal substantial dilithium deposits beneath
the planetoid's crust. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Full sensor sweep. <br>
KIM: The deposits are in the upper mantle, about sixty kilometres down.
<br>
TUVOK: We'll have to use phasers to cut through the <br>
KIM: Hold on. <br>
JANEWAY: What is it? <br>
KIM: Some kind of resonance wave emanating from the core. It's building
fast, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Right after we ran our scans? That can't be a coincidence.
Back us off, Tom. <br>
SEVEN: The planetoid is destabilising. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Shields. <br>(The planetoid goes KaBOOM!) <br>
JANEWAY: Report. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We're trapped in a cloud of metreon gas. It's collapsed our
warp field and knocked the impulse engines offline. <br>
TUVOK: A heavily armed vessel just dropped out of warp off the port
bow. <br>
SEVEN: Captain, I recognise it. It's Hazari. Species four two two
eight. Technologically advanced, extremely violent. They make excellent
tactical drones. <br>
KIM: What do they want with us? <br>
SEVEN: The Hazari are hired to capture and deliver alien vessels. <br>
PARIS: Bounty hunters. <br>
SEVEN: Yes. <br>
KIM: So who hired them? <br>
CHAKOTAY: The Malon, the Devore? We've made our share of enemies here. <br>
KIM: They're hailing. <br>(Lots of reptilian descendants in this area of space.)<br>
Y'SEK [on viewscreen]: Surrender. No one need be hurt. My client would
prefer your vessel intact. <br>
JANEWAY: Who hired you? <br>
Y'SEK [on viewscreen]: That's not your concern. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm only asking because I'm curious how much they're paying?
Maybe we can do better. <br>
Y'SEK [on viewscreen]: Doubtful. <br>
JANEWAY: We're far from defenceless. Why don't you save yourself some
trouble. <br>
Y'SEK [on viewscreen]: It's no trouble. <br>
JANEWAY: Charge phaser banks to full power. <br>
Y'SEK [on viewscreen]: Fire and you'll ignite the gas cloud. You'll be
destroyed. <br>
JANEWAY: You've left me no choice. I suggest you back off if you want
to save your own ship. End transmission. <br>
TUVOK: They are moving closer. They've locked on a tractor beam. <br>
PARIS: Looks like they're calling your bluff, Captain. It was a bluff,
wasn't it? <br>
JANEWAY: Seven, do we still have warp power? <br>
SEVEN: Yes, but it's useless while we remain in the gas cloud. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe not. Reroute every spare gigawatt to the shields.
Prepare to fire phasers. <br>
TUVOK: Our target? <br>
JANEWAY: The gas cloud. <br>
SEVEN: Do you believe the impact will throw us clear? <br>
JANEWAY: If our shields hold. <br>
PARIS: That's a big if. <br>
JANEWAY: Go to warp one on my command. Fire. <br>(The gas cloud ignites, and Voyager rides the wave.)<br>
TUVOK: Shields are holding. We're approaching the perimeter of the gas
cloud. <br>
PARIS: We're out. <br>
JANEWAY: Warp speed. <br>
TUVOK: No sign of pursuit. <br>
JANEWAY: They weren't that heavily damaged. Why aren't they following
us?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Astrometrics
lab]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CHAKOTAY:
There's the reason they didn't come after us. They've got
reinforcements throughout the sector. <br>
KIM: Twenty three ships. <br>
CHAKOTAY: And long range scans show more on the way. <br>
KIM: Must be one hell of a reward. <br>
TUVOK: The size of the bounty is immaterial. According to Seven of
Nine, the Hazari pride themselves on honouring their agreements. <br>
KIM: Great. Bounty hunters with a work ethic. <br>
CHAKOTAY: There's got to be a way out, something they haven't
anticipated. Download the data for the Captain. She wants to see what
she can come up with on her own.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Mess
hall]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Janeway has turned a table into her desk, with a computer.)<br>NEELIX:
Should I have the Doctor prepare a hypospray? <br>
JANEWAY: Excuse me? <br>
NEELIX: So you can absorb the caffeine more directly. Save time. <br>
JANEWAY: Point well taken. I'll make this my last cup. <br>
NEELIX: How about trying a sounding board? <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, you don't want that job. <br>
NEELIX: Try me. <br>
JANEWAY: It's these Hazari. They're like jackals, circling, feinting to
draw us out while they cut off every route of escape. <br>
NEELIX: You make them sound worse than the Borg. <br>
JANEWAY: At least the Borg come straight at you. The Hazari wait,
invite you to make mistakes. They've anticipated almost every move we
can make, and the few things they seem to have missed, I'm convinced are
traps. You still glad you volunteered? <br>
NEELIX: We've faced tough odds before. You'll get us through.
Goodnight. <br>
JANEWAY: Goodnight. <br>(Neelix leaves. Janeway gets up and stretches.)<br>
KURROS: There is nothing like a good problem to spark the synapses, is
there? To open the mind to new possibilities, new ways of seeing
things. Of course, one must always confront self- doubt and fear, but
that is a small price to pay for the exhilaration of finding the
perfect solution. <br>
JANEWAY: Who are you and what do you want? <br>
KURROS: You have a problem, Captain. I am the solution. <br>
JANEWAY: Security to the Mess hall. Intruder alert <br>
KURROS: I've deactivated your communications device, Captain, but do not
worry. I am not an intruder. In fact, I am not really here. <br>
JANEWAY: A hologram. <br>
KURROS: Nothing so crude. An isomorphic projection. <br>(He sips her coffee.)<br>KURROS: You actually enjoy
this? <br>
JANEWAY: It's an acquired taste. <br>
KURROS: It bears a resemblance to an Alkian confection we acquired
several years ago. <br>
JANEWAY: We? <br>
KURROS: I am a member of a small group. Explorers, like you. But we seek
out challenges, problems to be solved. Technological, biological,
social, even artistic. <br>
JANEWAY: A Think Tank. <br>
KURROS: I like that. It's very apt. Our Think Tank is nearby. A modest
vessel. I have come to offer our help with your Hazari paradox. <br>
JANEWAY: Paradox? <br>
KURROS: That is right. Is it an escape route or is it a trap? Do they
know that you know that they know? It is the best kind of puzzle. Pure
tactics, psychology. <br>
JANEWAY: Something tells me your help comes with a price tag. <br>
KURROS: Whatever your culture has to offer that is unique. Technology
perhaps, or maybe something you would not even think to value. I would
need a closer look at your database. <br>
JANEWAY: And how do I know you aren't an Hazari trap? Maybe they're
trying to lure us into an ambush, like before. <br>
KURROS: You are wise to be suspicious, Captain. We have done some
preliminary analysis on their
manoeuvres. It does suggest some more likely ambushes. I've downloaded
the data onto your computer. <br>
JANEWAY: All right. You've got my attention. But I want to meet you
face to face. And the rest of your crew. <br>
KURROS: Naturally. Our coordinates are in here, too. But we have our
own security concerns, Captain. Please, bring only one crewman and no
scanning equipment. <br>
JANEWAY: Fair enough. <br>
KURROS: Then I look forward to meeting you in person.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TUVOK:
We're approaching the coordinates. <br>
JANEWAY: Full stop. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Looks like there's nothing here. <br>
KIM: Maybe they're cloaked. <br>
SEVEN: I'm reading a subspace flux. <br>(The Think Tank appears, looking like an oversized probe or small spacestation rather than a spaceship.)<br>
TUVOK: The vessel's hull is composed of a neutronium-based alloy. <br>
JANEWAY: Starfleet's theorised about such materials, but we've never
come close to producing them. <br>
SEVEN: Neither have the Borg. The Think Tank's technology is advanced. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, you and I will have the chance to evaluate it first
hand. Mister Kim, you have the transport coordinates. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Fennim greets them with his unintelligible noises.)<br>
SEVEN: The universal translator must be inoperative. <br>
JANEWAY: Or his speech patterns are too complex to process. <br>(They look at the sea-slug's tank.)<br>JANEWAY: They must be studying it. <br>
KURROS: Actually, she is studying you. Our resident expert on temporal
physics. Perhaps the most gifted member of our group. She finds you
interesting. <br>
SEVEN: How do you communicate? <br>
JANEWAY: One of my most gifted crewmen, Seven of Nine.&nbsp;<br>
KURROS: Bionetic implants, neural transceivers? A Borg? I've never seen
one outside the Collective. <br>
SEVEN: I am an individual now. You may address your comments to me. <br>
KURROS: Forgive me. I am Kurros, and this is Fennim. In answer to your earlier question, this device allows the
members of our group to communicate telepathically. <br>(A large hemispherical pale blue pulsing device set into a raised section of the floor.)<br>
SEVEN: Impressive. <br>(The sound of a whale.)<br>
KURROS: It sounds as if another member of our crew is anxious to meet
you. <br>(They go to the viewport into Bevvox's tank.)<br>
SEVEN: A bioplasmic lifeform. <br>
KURROS: His name is Bevvox. He prefers a variable gravity environment. <br>
JANEWAY: What's his specialty? <br>
KURROS: At the moment exo-sociology and quantum mechanics, but his
interests vary from time to time. Bevvox founded our group more than
one hundred years ago, after wandering the galaxy on his own for a few
millennia. <br>
SEVEN: How old is this creature? <br>
KURROS: If you please, that is a sensitive topic with him. And there is
one other individual who rounds out our group. <br>(The mechanoid.)<br>
SEVEN: An artificial intelligence. <br>
KURROS: The mind of mathematician and the soul of an artist. I'm afraid
he'd much rather be modelling a fractal sculpture than analysing the
data of our latest astronomical scan. And now you have met us all. A
small group of minds, but we have helped hundreds of clients. We turned
the tide in the war between the Bara Plenum and the Motali Empire.
Re-ignited the red giants of the Zai Cluster. Just recently, we found a
cure for the Vidiian phage. <br>
JANEWAY: The Vidiians? <br>
KURROS: You would hardly recognise them now. Just last month we helped
retrieve a Lyridian child's runaway pet. A subspace mesomorph, I might
add. We had to invent a whole new scanning technology just to find it. <br>
JANEWAY: And what did you ask for as compensation? <br>
KURROS: One of their transgalactic star charts. The best map of the
known galaxy ever created. When we helped the citizens of Rivos Five
resist the Borg, all we asked for was the recipe for their famous
zoth-nut soup. Care for a taste? <br>
SEVEN: Another time, perhaps. <br>
JANEWAY: Tell me, is there any job you won't do? <br>
KURROS: What do you mean? <br>
JANEWAY: Well, we have a non-interference protocol, our Prime
Directive. I'm curious where you draw the line. <br>
KURROS: As you know, there is no shortage of conflict in what you call
the Delta Quadrant. Many of our clients are at war. To be frank, we
will assist in the neutralisation of fleets, starbases, even planets.
But we will not participate in the decimation of an entire species, nor
will we design weapons of mass destruction. My colleague here wishes to
speak to Seven of Nine about her bionetic technology. May he interface
with you? <br>(Seven steps up to the mechanoid.)<br>
SEVEN: I am in direct telepathic communication with this individual. It
is requesting information about integrating organic components into its
technology. <br>
JANEWAY: Feel free to give him some pointers. <br>(There is a short pause.)<br>
SEVEN: You're welcome. <br>
KURROS: To business, Captain. I believe we can solve the Hazari paradox
without firing a single weapon. <br>
JANEWAY: That's just what I'm looking for. <br>
KURROS: Then there is only the matter of payment. <br>(Janeway hands over a PADD.)<br>
JANEWAY: Voyager's schematics and an overview of its database. Specify
what you want and I'll see what I can do. I recommend the replicators.
They're very popular this year. <br>
KURROS: I'll contact you with our requests.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CHAKOTAY:
I take it First Contact was a success? <br>
JANEWAY: I have some qualms about their morality, but I believe they
can help us. <br>
SEVEN: It was an interesting experience. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Glad to hear it. We don't have much good news of our own.
Every escape route we've considered is clearly a trap, and more Hazari
ships keep joining the search. <br>
JANEWAY: Then we have no choice. We'll put our own plans on hold and
see what the Think Tank comes up with. </font></p>

Come in. <br>
TUVOK: You have a visitor. Mister Kurros has returned in isomorphic
form. <br>
JANEWAY: Send him in. Welcome back. <br>
KURROS: Captain, we have compiled a short list of items we would like.
It was not easy. Voyager has a great deal to offer. <br>
JANEWAY: Quantum slipstream technology. I should warn you. We never got
that to work reliably. <br>
KURROS: It is still intriguing, theoretically. <br>
JANEWAY: Neelix's recipe for Chadre'kab? <br>
KURROS: Yes. <br>
JANEWAY: An ancient Olmec figurine. I guess Commander Chakotay can be
persuaded to part with it. <br>
KURROS: I am pleased to hear that. <br>
JANEWAY: You can't be serious. <br>
KURROS: I realise the next item may seem unorthodox, but I believe it
can be beneficial to both of us. <br>
JANEWAY: You never mentioned anything about bartering my crew members. <br>
KURROS: She will have an extraordinary opportunity to explore the
galaxy as one of us. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm afraid the answer is no. <br>
KURROS: I understand your feelings, Captain, but have you thought to
ask Seven of Nine herself? <br>(So she does.)<br>SEVEN: A
curious proposition. <br>
JANEWAY: To say the least. <br>
SEVEN: How do you wish to proceed? <br>
JANEWAY: I want your opinion. <br>
SEVEN: They are offering us the assistance we require, I am the payment
they require. The solution is obvious. <br>
JANEWAY: This isn't a puzzle, Seven. There is no solution. What's at
issue here is your future. <br>
SEVEN: The issue is Voyager's survival. <br>
JANEWAY: Sit. Please. While I still question this Think Tank's way of
doing things, there is a genuine opportunity for exploration. It could
be the chance of a lifetime. <br>
SEVEN: You're saying I should go? <br>
JANEWAY: I don't want you to go, but it's not my right to tell you what
to do. Until now, I've kept a close eye on your progress, helped you
with decisions but, I think you've learned enough as an individual to
make this decision yourself. Would you like to join them? <br>
SEVEN: I am intrigued. They are an unusual Collective with a compelling
mission. But I require more data. <br>
JANEWAY: That's why I want you to talk to Kurros yourself. See if he
can answer your questions. <br>
SEVEN: Captain, I appreciate your giving me this choice. <br>
JANEWAY: You've earned it. And remember, if you do choose to go, make
sure it's what you want, not what you think is best for Voyager. We're
getting out of this, with or without the Think Tank's help.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Cargo
Bay two]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
Why me? <br>
KURROS: I admire your humility. The collective knowledge of the Borg
contained within a single mind. When we factor in your innate
intelligence and the enhancements afforded you by your bionetic
implants,
we concluded you are an ideal candidate. The first we have recruited in
seventeen years. <br>
SEVEN: When did you arrive at this assessment? <br>
KURROS: During your interview. <br>
SEVEN: My dialogue with the artificial intelligence. <br>
KURROS: It was the most efficient way to evaluate your abilities. I am
sure you can appreciate that. <br>
SEVEN: How much do you know about me? <br>
KURROS: Enough to know that you are tapping into only a fraction of
your potential as a member of Voyager's crew. You were adjusting the
deflector array to improve shield harmonics. Do you find such duties
challenging? <br>
SEVEN: No. <br>
KURROS: Without problems that test the limits of your abilities, you
cannot expand them. Perfection will always be beyond your reach. Seven,
you could become one of the greatest intellects in the galaxy, but that
will not happen here among these limited lifeforms. <br>
SEVEN: The crew of Voyager has accepted me, integrated me into their
Collective. <br>
KURROS: They are your family. It was hard for me to leave my family,
too. And I was only a child. Not much older than you when you were
first assimilated. <br>
SEVEN: Why did you leave? <br>
KURROS: To help them and my world solve a cataclysmic problem. <br>
SEVEN: The Think Tank requested you as payment. <br>
KURROS: I did not realise it at first. I was too young. But they gave
me a remarkable opportunity, and now I am offering the same to you. <br>
SEVEN: Your group can assist many Collectives, and yet you often use
that ability as a means of coercion to obtain what you want. How many
have suffered because they were unwilling to agree to your conditions? <br>
KURROS: We have a singular mission, to perfect our knowledge.
Perfection sometimes necessitates selfishness. It is your life. Not
Voyager's, not Captain Janeway's or anyone else's. It is up to you to
achieve the goals you have set for yourself. <br>
SEVEN: I agree, but I can do that here. <br>
KURROS: Please, take more time to think about this. We will remain
nearby in case you change your mind. <br>
SEVEN: I doubt that will happen. <br>
TUVOK [OC]: Seven of Nine, report to the bridge. <br>

JANEWAY: Two Hazari ships are approaching. <rb>
&nbsp;<br>
SEVEN: I have declined their offer. <br>
KURROS: Our first offer. <br>
JANEWAY: Glad you're sticking around. Take your station. <br>
TUVOK: They are dropping out of warp, flanking our position. <br>(Whumph!)<br>
JANEWAY: Which one fired? <br>
TUVOK: The ship to starboard. Shields down to sixty percent. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Evasive manoeuvres. Target their weapons systems and return
fire. <br>
TUVOK: Their shields are holding. <br>
PARIS: I can't get away. They're right on top of us. <br>
KIM: Hull integrity's been compromised on decks seven and twelve. <br>
KURROS: Captain, when the Hazari strike in pairs, one ship always
remains behind to reinforce the shields of the attacking vessel. <br>
JANEWAY: So we should target the support ship. How much is this tip
going to cost me? <br>
KURROS: This one is free. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll take it. Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: Retargeting. Firing photon torpedoes. They are disengaging. <br>
JANEWAY: Get us out of here, maximum warp. Thanks for the help. <br>
KURROS: Consider it a friendly gesture of goodwill in the hopes that
Seven will change her mind. <br>
SEVEN: I have not. <br>
KURROS: You are making a fatal mistake. We have already analysed
hundreds of scenarios. Voyager will not survive without our help. <br>
JANEWAY: Your scenarios, not mine. <br>
KURROS: Your confidence is unfounded, Captain. Reconsider. Order Seven
of Nine to join us. <br>
JANEWAY: We have an old expression, Kurros. Don't call us, we'll call
you. Remodulate the shields to a phase variance frequency. <br>(Kurros disappears.)<br>
TUVOK: His ship is vanishing from sensors. It's being absorbed into
subspace. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I get the distinct feeling they won't take no for an answer. <br>

and our would-be saviours.

They've entered the debris field. <br>
JANEWAY: Detonate the spatial charges. <br>(The Hazari vessel gets bounced around.)<br>

Any luck? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm still trying to access their primary database. <br>
JANEWAY: Let me guess. They're the strong but silent types. <br>
TUVOK: Very silent. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Did you try a mind meld? <br>
TUVOK: Without success. They are unusually resistant. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, hold off on the torture till we see what we can dig up
here. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I've found something. A series of encoded transmissions. <br>
JANEWAY: They've been discussing Voyager. Our coordinates, our
defences. <br>
TUVOK: Whoever hired the Hazari know a lot about us. <br>
JANEWAY: Check these sensor logs. See if they had any visitors
recently. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I've got some bioreadings, but they're pretty scrambled. <br>
TUVOK: If they are bioreadings, perhaps the Doctor can unscramble them.
<br>
JANEWAY: Tell him to give it a try.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH:
I've created a forensic reconstruction from the bioreadings, using the
holoemitters. Brace yourselves. <br>
JANEWAY: Malon. Huh, they must really hold a grudge. We haven't run into
them for months. I'm sorry, Doctor, something doesn't feel right. <br>
TUVOK: The Malon are economically motivated. <br>
JANEWAY: And there's no profit in revenge. Take a look at this.
Isomorphic signatures embedded in the bioreadings. This was no Malon,
it was only a projection. <br>
EMH: You mean that's a hologram of a hologram? <br>
TUVOK: In a manner of speaking. I believe I can restore the original
biosignal parameters. Brace yourself. <br>(It is Kurros.)<br>
JANEWAY: Well, it appears our Hazari paradox is more complex than we
thought.

I believe we're both being manipulated by the same person. Recognise
him? <br>(She holds up a PADD.)<br>
Y'SEK: No. <br>
JANEWAY: His name is Kurros, The Malon you met with was nothing more
than a projection. <br>
Y'SEK: My sensors would have detected a hologram. <br>
JANEWAY: Not this one. Kurros is a member of a Think Tank. They solve
problems for a price. Oh, you have heard of them. <br>
Y'SEK: They're notorious in this sector. They've made quite a few
enemies. <br>
JANEWAY: Enemies who might be willing to pay a hell of a bounty. <br>
Y'SEK: Their technology is very advanced. It makes them difficult to
track. <br>
JANEWAY: Not if we work together. You're the best hunters in the
quadrant and we have the perfect lure. All we have to do now is
out-think the Think Tank.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Instead of in the briefing room, the brain-storming session is being held here with plenty of coffee.)<br>JANEWAY:
We've got a puzzle and we're not leaving this room until we solve it.
The Think Tank is out there somewhere, hiding in subspace. How do we
find them? And even if we can, their ship's hull is neutronium-based
alloy, impervious to our weapons. How do we capture them? <br>
KIM: What if we send out a multispatial probe? <br>
TORRES: It would take weeks of scanning to find them. <br>
Y'SEK: Weeks? We're not willing to wait that long. <br>
TUVOK: We could use subspatial charges to force them into the open. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Where do we target the charges? We've still got to find them
first. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe we're going about this the wrong way. A direct assault
seems unlikely to succeed. Pure tactics, psychology. That's how they
solve problems. That's what we have to do. They've created this paradox
to manipulate us into giving them Seven of Nine. How do we manipulate
them? Think. <br>(The group breaks into smaller units to discuss ideas. Later -)<br>NEELIX:
I thought we were onto something with B'Elanna's plan <br>
TORRES: Forget it. I was wrong. <br>
PARIS: Let him talk. <br>
EMH: We're talking in circles. <br>
Y'SEK: Enough! Three hours, no progress. I should have contacted my
ships by now. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe we can't out-think them. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: We have to assume they've planned for every contingency,
including anything we could come up with to undermine their plan. This
thing has been driving me crazy. You said you knew the solution. Prove
it. <br>(Janeway hands the Sheer Lunacy to Seven, who presses a few buttons and all the lights go out. She has solved it.)<br>JANEWAY: Seven, how'd you do that? <br>
SEVEN: I scanned the device. Its mechanism operates on a simple fractal
regression. <br>
PARIS: You scanned it? That's cheating. <br>
SEVEN: Cheating is often more efficient. <br>
JANEWAY: If you can't solve a puzzle, cheat. If you can't out-think a
Think Tank, don't try. <br>
NEELIX: Are you suggesting we give up? <br>
JANEWAY: Not at all. When you were in contact with the artificial
intelligence, you were linked through their internal communications
array. <br>
SEVEN: Yes, for several seconds. <br>
JANEWAY: If you were to link with them again, we might be able to
disrupt those systems. If they can't communicate, they can't function
as a Think Tank. They'd be vulnerable. <br>
EMH: Back to square one. How do we find them? <br>
JANEWAY: Simple. We give them what they want. You're going to join
their group willingly. <br>
Y'SEK: They won't believe her. <br>
JANEWAY: We'll have to make them believe. Pull up a chair. We've got
some more work to do.

They're responding. <br>

be of assistance? <br>
Y'SEK: You deceived us. <br>
KURROS [on monitor]: I do not believe we have met. <br>
Y'SEK: Stop the pretence. You wanted us to deliver Voyager. Very well. But only if you triple our bounty. <br>
KURROS [on monitor]: My friend, regardless of the circumstances, we have
a contract. <br>
Y'SEK: Pay us, or we let Voyager go. <br>
KURROS [on monitor]: All right, we will triple the bounty. But you must
deliver them to us now. <br>
Y'SEK: Agreed. We'll contact the rest of our ships. We'll seize Voyager
as planned.

Shields down to thirty percent. <br>
JANEWAY: Return fire. <br>
TUVOK: Our phasers aren't penetrating their shields. <br>
KIM: That last volley took out our shield generators and phaser banks. <br>
TUVOK: Life support's failing, all decks. <br>
KURROS: Let us be honest, Captain. Things do not seem to be going your
way. <br>
JANEWAY: Don't count us out just yet. <br>
KURROS: I admit you have been clever. You uncovered our subterfuge, but
you failed to factor in all the variables. The greed of the Hazari, for
example. <br>
JANEWAY: Photon torpedoes? <br>
TUVOK: Aft launchers are still online. <br>
JANEWAY: Target a full spread at the lead Hazari ship. <br>
KURROS: A few torpedoes will not alter the outcome. If you do not
convince Seven of Nine to join us now, the destruction of your ship is
ninety nine point eight percent certain. <br>
JANEWAY: Fire. <br>
TUVOK: Direct hit. It's been disabled. <rb>
&nbsp;<br>
KURROS: Clinging to that point two percentage? Hazari reinforcements
should be here any minute. <br>
PARIS: He's right. Sensors just picked up a half dozen ships on an
intercept course. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, I'm detecting an unauthorised shuttle launch. It's
Seven of Nine. <br>

subspace. She's gone. <br>

Why is he in such a hurry? <br>
SEVEN: Comply. <br>
KURROS: If we decloak, we would be vulnerable. The Hazari could make
quite a bounty on us. Far more than we are paying
them. <br>
SEVEN: Their technology is inferior to yours. They would never attack
you directly. <br>
KURROS: I think this is a trap, a new paradox your Captain has created
for us. If we call their bluff, the Hazari might destroy Voyager, and we
would lose you. If we reveal ourselves, we could be destroyed. <br>
SEVEN: You told me, without problems to test the limits of your
ability, you can never expand them. <br>
KURROS: There is one very simple way to narrow the odds. We simply link
you to our communications system, allow our artificial intelligence to
probe your mind as it did before, and Captain Janeway's plans will be
revealed, like a jewel in a bed of fog. <br>
