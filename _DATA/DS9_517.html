<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: Now remember, I want him treated like a
visiting head of state. Full communications and computer access, any
assistance he may need from the station's crew. <br>
DAX: You should have told us know he was coming sooner. I think we have
a red carpet in storage somewhere. <br>
KIRA: Dax, this is important. Tekeny Ghemor led the dissident movement
against Cardassia's Central Command. And now that Dukat and the
Dominion have taken over, there is no one better qualified to lead the
opposition. <br>
DAX: Besides, he's practically your father. <br>
WORF: Your father? Ghemor is a Cardassian. <br>
KIRA: It's a long story. <br>
DAX: The Cardassians once kidnapped Kira and surgically altered her to
look like Ghemor's missing daughter. (link to Second Skin) <br>
KIRA: It was part of a plan to expose him as the leader of the
dissident movement. <br>
WORF: Cardassian politics are very complex. <br>
DAX: I think they like it that way. <br>
KIRA: Ghemor may be the only hope left for Cardassia. He deserves our
help. <br>
(Kira has her back to the airlock.) <br>
GHEMOR: That's a lot of faith to put in one man. <br>
(Kira spins round.) <br>
GHEMOR: I hope I won't prove too great a disappointment. <br>
KIRA: Legate Ghemor. It's good to see you. <br>
GHEMOR: How many times must I tell you, Nerys? If you won't call me
father, Tekeny will do. <br>
KIRA: Welcome to Deep Space Nine, Tekeny. This is our science officer,
Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax, and our strategic operations officer,
Lieutenant Commander Worf. <br>
GHEMOR: That's quite a reception for an old man. Ah, I see you're
wearing the bracelet I gave you. <br>
KIRA: Not exactly permitted under the uniform code, but <br>
GHEMOR: It looks good on you. It was a pleasure meeting both of you,
but if you don't mind, I'm afraid the journey here was a little
draining. <br>
KIRA: Oh, I'll show you to your quarters. <br>
(Kira and Ghemor leave.) <br>
WORF: Major Kira, friends with a Cardassian. It seems wrong. <br>
DAX: You should've known her five years ago. Back then, I never thought
she'd be friends with anyone.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: I've had the replicator programmed with a
complete Cardassian menu. You've got twenty six hour a day computer
access, a private subspace comm. channel, and if there is anything else
you need, you just ask me. <br>
GHEMOR: I wish I had your energy. <br>
KIRA: I am sorry. I just wanted you to feel at home. <br>
GHEMOR: You've been very kind. <br>
KIRA: I thought you should know. I checked with Bajoran Security. There
are still no leads on your daughter. <br>
GHEMOR: She's dead, isn't she? <br>
KIRA: We don't know that. Now, if Iliana is still alive, she's been
undercover on Bajor for over a decade now. It's very hard to find
someone who's been hiding that long. <br>
GHEMOR: I know you're trying to keep my hopes up, but it's time I faced
the facts. I'm alone. You're the closest thing to family that I have
left. <br>
KIRA: Bajoran Security has not given up hope. Neither should you. You
just have to be patient. <br>
GHEMOR: I'm afraid patience is for the young. But what about you,
Nerys? How is life treating you? <br>
KIRA: Oh, I've got no complaints. Now, did you read the proposal I sent
you? <br>
GHEMOR: It was very ambitious, but I'm afraid you'll have to find
another person to lead the effort. <br>
KIRA: No, you are the perfect person for the job. You're still popular
on Cardassia. The people respect you. They'll listen to you. <br>
GHEMOR: It's not that simple. <br>
KIRA: We can make it work. We'll set up a government in exile here on
the station. You could make regular transmissions into Cardassia, issue
corrections to their propaganda, mobilise your old friends in the
dissident movement. <br>
GHEMOR: Nerys, it's a good plan, but I can't help you. <br>
KIRA: Why? <br>
GHEMOR: I have Yarim Fel syndrome. It's terminal, Nerys. I'm dying.

disease has already spread throughout your digestive tract, your
circulatory and respiratory systems, and your cartilaginous tissue. <br>
GHEMOR: How much time do I have left? <br>
BASHIR: I'm not sure. There are still some treatments we can try.
Hexadrin therapy or neuroregeneration procedures. <br>
GHEMOR: I appreciate anything you can do. I'm sorry, Nerys. I'm afraid
this isn't going the way you planned. <br>

DUKAT [on viewscreen]: Ah, Captain Sisko. Always a pleasure. <br>
SISKO: Still calling yourself Gul? I'm surprised you haven't promoted
yourself back to Legate by now. <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: I prefer the title Gul. So much more hands-on
than Legate. And less pretentious than the other alternatives,
President, Emperor, First Minister, Emissary. <br>
SISKO: How about Dominion Puppet? <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: Captain, such comments only reveal a deep
misunderstanding of the intricacies of the Dominion political system.
Under our new administration, Cardassia enjoys unparalleled autonomy
and <br>
SISKO: You can justify yourself later, Dukat. I'm a busy man. <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: Very well. We have reason to believe you have
one of our citizens aboard your station. A certain Tekeny Ghemor,
formerly a Legate in the Cardassian Central Command. <br>
SISKO: And if we do? <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: Well, we want him back. To put it mildly, he has
a lot to answer for. <br>
SISKO: I will take your request under advisement. But considering the
Federation doesn't recognise your government, and that Cardassia has
never agreed to an extradition treaty with Bajor or the Federation, you
shouldn't get your hopes up.

GHEMOR: What a beautiful baby you are. Yes. You must be very proud. <br>
KIRA: He's Miles and Keiko's baby. I just carried him to term for them.
<br>
(Ghemor winces.) <br>
GHEMOR: Maybe you'd better? <br>
KIRA: Yeah. (takes Yoshi) Are you? <br>
GHEMOR: It'll pass. It's silly, but I almost feel like a grandfather.
After all, you're the closest thing I have to a daughter. <br>
KIRA: Yoshi's the closest thing I have to a son. You'd make a terrific
grandfather. <br>
GHEMOR: And what about you, Nerys? Have you ever thought about having
one of your own? Maybe with that Shakaar fellow of yours? <br>
KIRA: You know about me and Shakaar? <br>
GHEMOR: I've been keeping an eye on you. It made me feel like I still
had family. <br>
KIRA: What did you do, hire someone to follow me around? <br>
GHEMOR: Credit an old man with some restraint. I just had people let me
know when they heard anything about you. Like it or not, you're a
public figure, Nerys. First officer of one of the most important
military installations in the quadrant. Your feud with Kai Winn has
become already something of a legend. Did you know that you have your
own section in the Cardassian Central Archives? You've made an
impression on people, Nerys. A good one. You should be proud of
everything you've accomplished. I am. <br>
KIRA: You know, I've kept my ears open for news about you too. I was
worried about you. Opposing the Cardassian government is dangerous
business. <br>
GHEMOR: I enjoyed it, while it lasted. I have a fondness for hopeless
causes. It runs in the family. <br>
KIRA: Dukat called the station. He wants you extradited to Cardassia. <br>
GHEMOR: I'm not surprised. He knows that as long as I'm alive, I'm a
threat to him. <br>
KIRA: We won't let him get his hands on you. <br>
GHEMOR: Nerys, I know more about the Cardassian government than anyone
alive. Names, alliances, plots. Things that could do a lot of good in
the right hands. There's a Cardassian tradition, shri-tal. The dying
give their secrets to their family to use against their enemies. But I
have no one left to carry my secrets. No one but you. <br>
KIRA: Me? <br>
GHEMOR: Be my daughter one last time, Nerys. Hear what I know and use
it as you see fit.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: I hate to sound callous, but we have a
tremendous opportunity here. Ghemor is basically volunteering to give
us more intelligence on Cardassia than we've been able to gather in
five years. <br>
KIRA: That's exactly what he's doing. <br>
SISKO: It's quite a responsibility he's handing you. <br>
KIRA: I know. I can't help wondering if he's chosen the right person.
What if I get too involved or I don't ask the right questions? Maybe I
can convince Ghemor to talk to a counsellor or Constable Odo. I mean,
he questions people every day. <br>
SISKO: Maybe. But Ghemor just doesn't want to be debriefed. He wants
someone to talk to. Someone to be with until the end. <br>

BASHIR: If Ghemor's pain gets too severe, push this. It'll administer a
small dose of triptacedrine. If you want to replenish the medication,
be sure and turn this valve, disconnect it from here, and replace it
with a new supply. If you don't want to do it yourself, you can always
call for a nurse to help. <br>
KIRA: I can manage. <br>
BASHIR: I hope you're right. Looking with someone with a terminal
condition isn't easy, especially in this case where you'll be acting as
Ghemor's only source of emotional support. <br>

SISKO: What's wrong, Dukat? Are you afraid Ghemor's going to say
something that might undermine your cosy new position? <br>
DUKAT: Tread with care, Captain. You're coming dangerously close to
accusing the head of the Cardassian government of attempted murder. <br>
SISKO: Is that what I'm doing? <br>
WEYOUN: How delightful. The mysterious plots, the subtle innuendos, the
veiled threats. It's all so entertaining. <br>
(Weyoun drinks the kanar.) <br>
DUKAT: What? <br>
WEYOUN: Oh, my. That is quite toxic, isn't it? <br>
DUKAT: Are you insane? <br>
WEYOUN: Vorta are immune to most forms of poison. Comes in handy when
you're a diplomat. <br>
SISKO: Especially when you're working with the Cardassians. You can
keep the kanar, Dukat. Ghemor won't be drinking it.

ODO: It's a little late for services, Major. <br>
KIRA: I needed a quiet place to think. If you've got something to say
to me, Constable, say it. <br>
ODO: I understand you've stopped visiting Ghemor. <br>
KIRA: He lied to me. I thought he was different, but he's just like the
rest of them. <br>
ODO: Is he? Really. I've seen his file, too, Major. He was nineteen
when Kiessa was destroyed. He'd been in the military for less than a
year and was only one of four hundred soldiers at the monastery.
There's no way of knowing if he even fired a shot. <br>
KIRA: He shouldn't have been there at all. <br>
ODO: This isn't about Ghemor's war record. If it really mattered, you
wouldn't have waited for Dukat to hand it to you. You would have looked
it up yourself. <br>
KIRA: What are you trying to say? That I should go back down there? <br>
ODO: Ah. No, I wasn't saying that at all. Are you?

KIRA: I know. I know. <br>
TABAN: I can hear the Prophets calling me, Nerys. I can feel my pagh
slipping away. <br>
FUREL: Nerys. We found them. It's a Cardassian heavy weapons unit.
Third assault group, ninth order. <br>
KIRA: Hold on. I'll be right back. How far? <br>
FUREL: Just outside of Tempasa. <br>
KIRA: I'll go with you. <br>
FUREL: Are you sure? <br>
KIRA: I know the area. <br>
FUREL: So does Gantt. <br>
KIRA: They didn't shoot Gantt's father. They shot mine. <br>
FUREL: All right. Go. <br>
KIRA: We found the soldiers that did this to you. I'm going to make
them pay, just like I promised. <br>
TABAN: The others. Let them. You don't have to go. <br>
KIRA: Yes, I do. Yes, I do. I won't be long. Let's go!

KIRA: Come in. <br>
BASHIR: I thought you should know that Ghemor's condition has
deteriorated. He'll be dead within the hour. <br>
KIRA: Thank you for the information, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: Is that it? Thank you for the information? Ghemor is dying. <br>
KIRA: I heard you. <br>
BASHIR: Major, he wants to see you. <br>
KIRA: Well, I don't want to see him. <br>
BASHIR: Major, please, it's almost over. There's no more questions to
ask, no more work to be done. Just go to his quarters and sit with him.
<br>
KIRA: I said no. Don't ask me again. <br>
BASHIR: Fine. You must do what you want. But I think you're making a
mistake. Regardless of what Ghemor's done in the past, he doesn't
deserve to die alone. Nobody does.

FUREL: All four mortar rounds right in the central compound. And the
way they ran, it was like kicking over a mound of barrowbugs. <br>
KIRA: What was the count? <br>
FUREL: Five skimmers, and at least, at least fifteen Cardassian dead.
Now that's not a bad day's work. We should celebrate. <br>
KIRA: Yeah. They kill us, we kill them. It's nothing worth celebrating.
<br>
GANTT: Nerys. Your father. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: Cause of death was CNS failure brought on
by Yarim Fel syndrome. One witness was present, a Major Kira Nerys of
the Bajoran Militia. Witness's statement is attached. Major, we're done
here. <br>
KIRA: That's it? A quick postmortem, a statement from the witness and a
little paperwork. It seems so straightforward. <br>
BASHIR: It never is. <br>
KIRA: He got so quiet toward the end. I could hear him whispering
things. His wife's name, Iliana's, even mine. Then the pain just got
too much for him and he just lay there, breathing. And at the end of
every exhale, there was this pause, and I thought that's it. It's over.
Then he'd force another breath, and another. I started counting them.
One hundred, two hundred, three hundred. He was fought for every last
second. I don't even think he knew I was there. <br>
BASHIR: He knew. You gave him what he needed. He didn't die alone. <br>
KIRA: Maybe he gave me something I needed. I missed my father's death
by less than an hour. Did you know that? Less than an hour. I always
told myself that it was bad luck, bad timing, the will of the Prophets.
But the truth is, I didn't have to go when I did. I could have stayed a
while longer. I saw my chance to get out and I took it. I saw so much
death during the occupation, I felt so much pain. But my father, he was
my strength, and I couldn't stand to see that strength slipping away.
So I ran. <br>
BASHIR: Just like you tried to run from Ghemor. <br>
KIRA: He reminded me so much of my father. Going through it again, I
just couldn't face it. <br>
BASHIR: But in the end, you did. You were there for Ghemor. <br>
KIRA: I owed it to him. I owed it to my father to get it right this
time.

DUKAT: Yes. I understand Legate Ghemor has passed away. <br>
SISKO: You must be very relieved. <br>
DUKAT: Oh Captain, such cynicism does not suit you. All of Cardassia
will mourn the passing of Tekeny Ghemor. He was a great man. <br>
SISKO: I'm surprised to hear you say that. <br>
DUKAT: Not at all. It takes a great man to admit he's wrong, and that's
what Ghemor did. I'm speaking of his last minute change of heart. His
deathbed decision to embrace the new Dominion government. <br>
SISKO: That's very moving, except for one small problem. It never
happened. <br>
WEYOUN: As you said, it's a small problem. <br>
DUKAT: I would like his body transferred to my ship. We'll take him
home and bury him with full state honours. <br>
SISKO: I'm afraid that's going to be impossible. Legate Ghemor's
funeral arrangements have already been taken care of.
