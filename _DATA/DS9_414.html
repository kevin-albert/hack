log, Stardate 46729.1. The Bajoran government has asked me to mediate a
disagreement between two rival factions, the Paqu and the Navot. At
issue is a land dispute which could trigger a civil war.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: Commander, the Paqu delegation has arrived at
docking port six. <br>
SISKO: Let's welcome them aboard. Dax, any word on the Navot? <br>
DAX: They should be here within the hour. <br>
O'BRIEN: Excuse me, Commander. <br>
SISKO: Chief, I thought you'd be on your way to Bajor by now. <br>
O'BRIEN: We're due to leave any moment. But, sir, I was wondering if
perhaps Ensign Boyer might replace me on this particular mission. After
all, I'd be little more than a chauffeur, and Boyer can pilot a
runabout just as well as I can. <br>
SISKO: Has something come up that requires your presence on the
station, Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh, no, sir. Everything's running smoothly for a change. But
around here, you never know. <br>
BASHIR: Ah, Chief, there you are. All set to go? <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. <br>
BASHIR: Commander, did the Magistrate give any indication regarding the
nature of this medical emergency? <br>
SISKO: Only that his village was in danger of extinction. <br>
BASHIR: In that case we'd better be on our way. <br>
SISKO: I agree. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. <br>
SISKO: Docking port six. <br>
BASHIR: You know, Chief, in a way I'm really looking forward to this
mission. <br>
O'BRIEN: Why's that? <br>
BASHIR: I see it as a wonderful opportunity for us to get to know each
other. <br>
O'BRIEN: Ah. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: I'd like you to set a preliminary meeting
with both sides for later this afternoon. Make sure they know that this
is an informal session. I just want to get them talking to each other. <br>
KIRA: Just getting them to sit down at the same table will be an
accomplishment. Sir, about these negotiations. <br>
SISKO: You have some advice for me? <br>
KIRA: There's an old saying on Bajor. The land and the people are one.
Well, the land inhabited by the Paqu and Navot is some of the harshest
on the planet. <br>
SISKO: Relax, Major. This is not my first time up at the plate. <br>
KIRA: Sir? <br>
SISKO: Besides, I'll have you by my side to help me avoid making
mistakes.

O'BRIEN: Of course. <br>
BASHIR: And I'd like an honest answer. <br>
O'BRIEN: You'll get one. <br>
BASHIR: Do I annoy you? <br>
O'BRIEN: Annoy me? What sort of a question's that? <br>
BASHIR: Well, the thing is, we've just spent two hours alone together
in this runabout and you hardly said a word to me the whole time. <br>
O'BRIEN: Really? I hadn't noticed. <br>
BASHIR: Oh, I see. <br>
O'BRIEN: I suppose because I was too busy thinking. <br>
BASHIR: Thinking? <br>
O'BRIEN: That's right. <br>
BASHIR: About what? <br>
O'BRIEN: What? <br>
BASHIR: What were you thinking about? I'm just curious. <br>
O'BRIEN: Let's see. I was thinking that when we get back to the
station, I'll have to run a level one diagnostic on the phase coil
generators. Satisfied? <br>
BASHIR: I suppose so. <br>
O'BRIEN: Glad to hear it. <br>
BASHIR: I mean, the only reason I bring it up is because your opinion
means a lot to me, and I'm aware I have a tendency to run off at the
mouth sometimes. <br>
O'BRIEN: Is that a fact. <br>
BASHIR: It's just a nervous habit. I hope you don't hold it against me.
<br>
O'BRIEN: Not at all, sir. <br>
BASHIR: And one more thing. <br>
O'BRIEN: What's that, sir? <br>
BASHIR: I don't think it's really necessary to call me sir. <br>
O'BRIEN: What should I call you? You're my superior officer. <br>
BASHIR: How about Julian? <br>
O'BRIEN: Is that an order? <br>
BASHIR: Of course not. It's just that I'd simply prefer it if you
called me by my first name. <br>
O'BRIEN: All right. We've achieved stable orbit around Bajor. We can
beam down any time. Julian.

of pollutants, and the ground water clear of bacterial contamination. <br>
FAREN: Gentlemen. I am Faren Kag, the village magistrate. <br>
BASHIR: I'm Doctor Bashir and this is Chief O'Brien. <br>

replicators make a fine larish pie. <br>
VARIS: I didn't come here to eat, Commander. <br>
SISKO: Then let's talk. The official negotiations don't begin until
tonight, but I thought it might be a good idea that we meet informally
to see where we all stand. According to the treaty that has existed
between you for the past ninety years, the border separating the Paqu
and the Navot shall forever be the river Glyrhond. <br>
WOBAN: That's correct. <br>
KIRA: Well, at least we all agree on something. <br>
SISKO: Now, as I understand it, during the occupation the Cardassians
diverted the river for use in their mining operations. As a result the
Glyrhond now flows twenty kilometres west of its former position. <br>
WOBAN: Twenty kilometres into Navot territory. <br>
VARIS: That's Paqu territory now. You read the treaty, Commander. The
river is our common border. <br>
WOBAN: The treaty says nothing about stealing land. If your father was
alive he would give us back what was ours. <br>
VARIS: My father would do no such thing. Besides, I'm Tetrarch now. I
will not be pressured into betraying my people. <br>
(Quark enters with drinks) <br>
QUARK: Let's see, two Bajoran synthales, a glass of Gamzian wine, and a
Trixian bubble juice for the little lady. <br>
VARIS: I'm not a little lady. <br>
(Varis throws the drink in Quark's face and storms out) <br>

JAKE: Why not? <br>

JAKE: And you can't hit my curve ball. <br>
NOG: It's a stupid game that even humans stopped playing hundreds of
years ago. <br>
JAKE: Maybe, but you still can't hit my curve ball. <br>
ODO: Mister Sisko, Nog, I thought I told you no dangling over the

NOG: We can see things better from down here. <br>
ODO: And what, may I ask, is so interesting? <br>
JAKE: Nothing. <br>

we can have Buck Bokai hit a few out to us. He was the greatest hitter

failure brought on by an accelerated rate of cellular decay. His body's
surrendering to old age. <br>
FAREN: Is there anything you can do? <br>
BASHIR: I can keep him comfortable and relatively free of pain. Other
than that, it's just a matter of time. I'm sorry. <br>
FAREN: But we need him. The Dal'Rok will be here soon. <br>
O'BRIEN: What's the Dal'Rok? <br>
FAREN: It's a terrible creature that lives in the woods just north of
the village. Every year at the end of harvest it appears. <br>
BASHIR: And you say it's coming here tonight? <br>
FAREN: Yes, it always comes for five nights. This will be the fourth.
And only the Sirah is strong enough to defeat it. <br>
BASHIR: Right now, the Sirah isn't strong enough to get out of bed. <br>

FAREN: But what about the Dal'Rok? Without your protection, he will
kill us all. <br>
O'BRIEN: Faren, I would like to help, really I would, but I don't know
how. <br>
FAREN: You must tell the story. <br>
O'BRIEN: As simple as that, is it? <br>
FAREN: May the Prophets grant you victory, Sirah. <br>
O'BRIEN: Let's hope so. <br>
(Faren leaves, followed by Hovath) <br>
BASHIR: Now what are we going to do? <br>
O'BRIEN: The way I see it, the only way out of this mess is to find out
exactly what this Dal'Rok is, and destroy it before it destroys us.

VARIS: I don't think so. <br>
NOG: You sure? <br>
JAKE: Let's go before you embarrass yourself. <br>
VARIS: Wait. <br>
NOG: Yes? <br>
VARIS: Do you remember that opportunity we were discussing yesterday? <br>
NOG: Yes. <br>
VARIS: How can you be sure that an opportunity is worth the risk? <br>
NOG: Instinct. The ninth Rule of Acquisition clearly states opportunity
plus instinct equals profit. <br>
VARIS: Instinct. <br>
JAKE: That's not going to help. <br>
VARIS: I think it does. Thank you, Nog. <br>
NOG: Good. Let's celebrate. <br>
VARIS: Celebrate? <br>
NOG: I took one of my uncle's security rods. <br>
JAKE: What are we going to do with that? <br>
NOG: I don't know. We could swipe Odo's bucket. <br>
JAKE: Are you kidding? <br>
VARIS: A bucket? <br>
NOG: Yeah. We'll give it back. <br>
JAKE: Yeah, but <br>
NOG: It'll be funny. <br>
JAKE: But we can't just walk into Security. <br>

night) <br>
O'BRIEN: There's some residual neutrino levels in the microstructure of
these rocks. <br>
BASHIR: If the Dal'Rok has no physical substance, how can it leave a
neutrino trace? <br>
O'BRIEN: I didn't say it made sense. But this rock face didn't just
spontaneously blow itself to pieces. <br>
BASHIR: Lucky for us, you were able to stop it before it did anymore
damage. <br>
O'BRIEN: All I did was repeat what the Sirah told me. <br>
BASHIR: In that case, how did the Sirah manage to stop it? <br>
O'BRIEN: Good question. Maybe there's some a control mechanism hidden
somewhere. <br>
(A woman brings a baby) <br>
O'BRIEN: Excuse me, miss. <br>

go to check the Sirah's room. <br>

HOVATH: There are more gifts outside for you. <br>
O'BRIEN: All right, bring them in. Hold on. Didn't you work for the
Sirah? <br>
HOVATH: I was his apprentice. <br>
O'BRIEN: Did he ever reveal any of his secrets? How he controlled the
Dal'Rok, and that sort of thing? <br>
HOVATH: Why ask me? Surely the Sirah must have taught you all you need
to know. <br>
O'BRIEN: All right, have it your way. Don't blame me when that creature
goes rampaging through your village. <br>

him in the mirror and they struggle) <br>

O'BRIEN: You won't get any argument from me. <br>
BASHIR: If he isn't, who is? <br>
HOVATH: I am. <br>
(pause for gasp and adverts) <br>
HOVATH: For nine years, I studied with the Sirah, learning the secrets
of the storyteller, only to have you come along and take my place. <br>
O'BRIEN: Look friend, as far as I'm concerned, the job's yours. <br>
BASHIR: But if you were supposed to take over, why come the Sirah chose
him? <br>
HOVATH: It was his way of punishing me. <br>
BASHIR: Punishing you? <br>
HOVATH: Three nights ago, the Sirah allowed me to tell the story. But
when the Dal'Rok appeared I was unable to control it. Several people
were injured. <br>
O'BRIEN: Control it? How? <br>
(Hovath picks up a bracelet) <br>
HOVATH: With this. The stone is said to be a fragment of an orb from
the Celestial Temple. <br>
BASHIR: We had one of these orbs aboard our station. We're aware of how
powerful they are. <br>
HOVATH: Many years ago, this village was deeply divided by hate and
mistrust. The first Sirah knew that unless he could find a way to unite
the people, the village would destroy itself. So he used the Orb
fragment as a catalyst to give their fears a physical form. <br>
O'BRIEN: So the villagers' thoughts create the Dal'Rok. <br>
HOVATH: Yes, but they don't know that. It's a secret which has passed
from Sirah to Sirah. <br>
O'BRIEN: Why do they need a storyteller? <br>
HOVATH: The story helps focus the villagers' thoughts. <br>
BASHIR: And that enables them to defeat the Dal'Rok by creating the
shimmering lights. <br>
HOVATH: I know if I had another chance, I could control the Dal'Rok. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, son, it looks like tonight you are going to get that
chance. <br>

FAREN: What is this? You have no right to wear those clothes. <br>
HOVATH: I have every right. <br>
FAREN: You had your chance to prove yourself. You failed. <br>
HOVATH: It won't happen again. <br>
FAREN: That's right, because you won't be allowed to endanger the
village a second time. Now take off those robes. <br>

SISKO: That's not much of an excuse. <br>
VARIS: Didn't you ever do anything foolish to impress a girl? <br>

SISKO: And? <br>
VARIS: Jake speaks very highly of you. He trusts you. <br>
SISKO: That's always nice to hear. <br>
VARIS: Hearing Jake speak of you reminded me of how much I miss my own

SISKO: I'm sure he'd be very proud of you. <br>
VARIS: I try to be strong, the way he was strong but. It's difficult. <br>
SISKO: From what I've learned about your father, he wasn't afraid to
compromise. <br>
VARIS: That's because he knew the Navot feared him. If I were to make
concessions, Woban would think I was weak. <br>
SISKO: I doubt he would be that foolish, but he is determined to get
that land back. <br>
VARIS: I'm not afraid of Woban or the Navot. <br>
SISKO: I never said you were. So your answer is still no. <br>
VARIS: You don't lose by saying no. <br>

to risk saying yes. <br>

both sides to say yes.

prepared to fight, like it has always fought, with the lights, the
shimmering lights. <br>
HOVATH: Something's wrong. <br>
BASHIR: What's wrong is O'Brien's not the Sirah. You are. <br>
O'BRIEN: You know what I'm talking about. Come on, you can do it. The
village is strong and unafraid and powerful, and ready to face the
Dal'Rok. <br>
BASHIR: Do you think that maybe the Sirah planned all this? He knew the
villagers had lost confidence in you, so he chose O'Brien as his
successor, knowing that you would have to rescue him. Don't you see?
This is your chance to prove once and for all that you are the true
Sirah. <br>
O'BRIEN: All right now, let's really focus and send this one out, okay?
Let's really the Dal'Rok a message. Where the hell are those lights? <br>

HOVATH: Wait, there is no need to run. A new voice appears to challenge
the Dal'Rok. <br>

HOVATH: The Dal'Rok is a fearsome enemy. The mountains tremble with its
fury. But our prosperity is its misery. Our unity is its vulnerability.
And our strength is its doom. <br>
(Out come the lights against the cloud.) <br>
HOVATH: Look, the Dal'Rok trembles. It fears our strength. It fears our
determination. It knows it cannot stand against us because the village
is united. We are as one. <br>
