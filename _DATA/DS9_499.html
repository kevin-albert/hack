ODO: I don't know. <br>
(Odo fits and goes semi-goo.) <br>
ODO: I think you did this to me. <br>
FOUNDER: You killed a changeling, Odo. That's why we forced you to
return home to enter into the Great Link and be judged. <br>
(Odo is tossed naked from the Link onto the atoll.) <br>
SISKO: What have you done to him? <br>
FOUNDER: We made him a solid. He's one of you now. <br>
BASHIR: Captain, I'm reading a heart, lungs, and a digestive system.
It's as if he were human. <br>
GOWRON [on monitor]: Will be considered the enemy and fired upon. <br>
ODO: Captain. It's him. <br>
SISKO: Gowron? What about him? <br>
ODO: During the Link, I sensed that the other changelings were trying
to hide things from me. Faces, names. One of them was him. <br>
KIRA: What are you saying? <br>
ODO: I'm saying that he's one of them. Gowron, the head of the Klingon
Empire, is a changeling.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: Where are they? They should've been back
hours ago. <br>
O'BRIEN: Maybe the meeting with Starfleet Command took longer than they
thought it would. <br>
KIRA: Then why haven't Sisko or Dax contacted us? <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, the whole area they're travelling through is crawling
with Klingon ships. The second they use their subspace transmitter,
they become a target. <br>
WORF: I never should have let them leave in a runabout. I should have
insisted that they take the Defiant. <br>
KIRA: You did. But the Captain's orders were clear. As long as we're at
war with the Klingons, we need the Defiant here to help protect the
station. <br>
O'BRIEN: All I know is that I'd hate to be dodging Klingon raiding
parties in nothing but a runabout. <br>
WORF: It would take a fleet of Klingon ships to breach the station's
defences. I say we take the Defiant and go looking for them. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm with Worf. <br>
KIRA: I'm glad the two of you are in agreement. But with the Captain
gone, I am in charge of the station and I say we stay. <br>
WORF: You may be in charge of the station, Major, but I command the
Defiant. <br>
KIRA: Mister Worf, the Captain has given us our orders and I intend for
us to follow them until he issues new ones. <br>
O'BRIEN: Hold on a minute. I'm reading a warp signature approaching the
station. <br>
WORF: It is the Rio Grande. <br>
KIRA: On screen. <br>
(A damaged runabout, trailing flames in vacuum. Where have I seen that
miracle before?) <br>
O'BRIEN: Looks like they had a run in with some Klingons. Weapons
systems, shields and comm. system are all pretty shot up. <br>
KIRA: Life signs? <br>
O'BRIEN: Two. One human, one Trill. <br>
WORF: Permission to welcome the Captain back on board. <br>
KIRA: Permission granted. <br>
(Worf and O'Brien leave.) <br>
(A short time later Dax and Sisko come up on the turbolift.) <br>
KIRA: Glad you made it back in one piece. <br>
SISKO: So are we. <br>
KIRA: How was your meeting with Starfleet Command? <br>
SISKO: I'm afraid the war's not going very well. The Klingons are
throwing everything they have at us. Starfleet's been able to slow them
down, but that's about all.

cause so much chaos. <br>
DAX: He can if he's impersonating the leader of the Klingon Empire. <br>
KIRA: So is Starfleet going to do something about Chancellor Gowron or
not? <br>
DAX: Oh, they're going to do something. <br>
SISKO: Starfleet's sending an infiltration team to Klingon territory.
Their orders are to do whatever it takes to prove that Gowron's a
shape-shifter. <br>
KIRA: Tough assignment. Who are they sending? <br>
SISKO: Me.

SISKO: Do I look happy, Quark? <br>
QUARK: Do you think any of these people looked happy when they walked
in here? How could they? There's a war going on. But they come because
they know I'll do everything in my power to help them forget their
troubles. For a reasonable fee, of course. Now, what can I do for you? <br>
SISKO: I'm looking for Odo. <br>
QUARK: Oh, Captain, we all have our failures, and he's mine. Every
since he lost his shape-shifting abilities, I haven't been able to get
a smile out of him. <br>
SISKO: Where is he? <br>
QUARK: I'm telling you, Captain, that's one depressed ex-changeling.
He's upstairs at his usual table. Just follow the black cloud.

ODO: Listen, Captain. Do you hear it? <br>
SISKO: You mean the bubbles? <br>
ODO: Soothing, isn't it? You know, before I became a solid I never
heard that. I didn't have a sense of taste so I never paid much
attention to food or drink. I had no idea how seductive they could be.
(tops up the glass) Would you like me to get you a glass? <br>
SISKO: I'm on duty. <br>
ODO: I'm not. <br>
SISKO: I thought you were always on duty. <br>
ODO: You know, at first I found the whole process of ingestion
disgusting. But now that I've gotten used to it, I find eating and
drinking to be quite comforting. It's one of the few things that you,
that we humanoids have control over. <br>
SISKO: Not necessarily. There's always the temptation to eat too much,
to drink too much. <br>
ODO: One has to find something to do with one's time. For some reason,
my work isn't as fulfilling as it used to be. <br>
SISKO: I might be able to do something about that. Starfleet has
ordered us to try to expose the Gowron changeling. I want you to come
with us. <br>
ODO: Maybe it would be better for you to take Deputy Yndar. There's
nothing I can do that he can't. <br>
SISKO: I don't need Yndar. I need you. <br>
ODO: What you need is someone who can turn into Gowron's pet targ. I
can't do that anymore. <br>
SISKO: What I need is my Chief of Security. There will be a staff
meeting at sixteen hundred hours. I expect you to be there.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Wardroom]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: According to Starfleet intelligence,
Chancellor Gowron has relocated Klingon military headquarters to
Ty'Gokor. <br>
WORF: That will make our job more difficult. Ty'Gokor is located in an
asteroid field deep in Klingon space. It is probably the most heavily
fortified installation in the Empire. <br>
SISKO: There are at least thirty warships stationed there at any given
time and the entire asteroid field is protected by a tachyon detection
grid. <br>
O'BRIEN: Which means there's no way we can get a cloaked ship within
transporter range. <br>
WORF: Even if we do find a way inside, getting close to Gowron will not
be easy. He is guarded around the clock by his personal security force,
the Yan-Isleth. <br>
DAX: The Brotherhood of the Sword. <br>
KIRA: Look, I don't want to sound negative, but even if you do get to
Gowron, how are you going to prove to the Klingons he's a changeling? <br>
ODO: I doubt he's going to stand still and let us take a blood sample. <br>
BASHIR: The Klingons are obsessive about blood screenings. If he's
lasted this long, the changeling impersonating Gowron must have already
found a way around them. <br>
WORF: There is another option. We could kill him. <br>
O'BRIEN: Dead changelings do revert to their gelatinous state. <br>
SISKO: Our orders are to expose Gowron, not assassinate him. Which is
why Starfleet has given us these. <br>
(Four baseball sized devices.) <br>
BASHIR: Very impressive. What are they? <br>
DAX: They're modified polaron emitters. <br>
(Prototype X-47 according to the wall monitor Dax switches on.) <br>
SISKO: Starfleet Science thinks that exposure to polaron radiation will
have a destabilising effect on changeling physiology. <br>
ODO: In other words, if we use these on Gowron and he is one of my
people, he won't be able to retain his humanoid shape. <br>
SISKO: That's the theory. <br>
DAX: The problem is, for it to work properly, you have to activate all
four emitters at once. <br>
SISKO: (holding the remote) With this. <br>
O'BRIEN: I hate prototypes. <br>
DAX: Plus, too much polaron radiation can be fatal. Which means we can
only expose a person once. Any more than that, changeling or not, and
they could die from radiation poisoning. <br>
SISKO: The plan is to smuggle these into Ty'Gokor. Once they're set up,
they can cover about twelve thousand cubic metres. <br>
O'BRIEN: So let me get this straight. All we have to do is get past an
enemy fleet, avoid a tachyon detection grid, beam into the middle of
Klingon headquarters and avoid the Brotherhood of the Sword long enough
to set these things up and activate them in front of Gowron. <br>
WORF: If we succeed, there will be many songs sung in our honour. <br>
O'BRIEN: Let's hope we're there to hear them. <br>
KIRA: The first problem is how to get you safely to Ty'Gokor. <br>
SISKO: That's one I think I can solve.

DUKAT: Damar, let's not spoil this special moment with predictions of
doom. Even you have to appreciate the audacity of Captain Sisko's plan.
<br>
DAMAR: Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital
assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes
would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else
within a few hundred kilometres. <br>
ODO: You should ask Dukat for some shore leave. I think you've been in
space too long. <br>
DAMAR: Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get
the job done? <br>
O'BRIEN: Shelling Ty'Gokor won't get the job done. You'd be lucky to
launch one torpedo before they shot you down. Besides, even a dozen
won't penetrate the shielding around the command centre. <br>
SISKO: Thank you for the input, Mister Damar, but we'll stick to the
original plan. Are you making any progress with our Klingon identity
files? <br>
DUKAT: Oh, don't worry, Captain. By the time we get to Ty'Gokor, we'll
have something suitably impressive to plant in their central computer
system. <br>
WORF: Our names should be added to the list of candidates for the Order
of the Bat'leth. <br>
DUKAT: The Order of the Bat'leth? Don't you think you might be
overdoing it? <br>

Chancellor Gowron will be presiding over the ceremony. <br>

SISKO: Not until morning. I don't want to take the chance of anyone
spotting them once they're in place. <br>
ODO: In that case, we might as well drink up. it's a pity it doesn't
have any bubbles. <br>
(The bloodwine in the barrel is now a lot lower. Sisko is having an
arm-wrestling match with one of the drunks.) <br>
O'BRIEN: You know, I think I'm actually beginning to like bloodwine. <br>
ODO: It's really not too bad, except for the taste. <br>
O'BRIEN: Just be thankful the anti-intoxicant we took is still working.
<br>
WORF: Or you would be so drunk you would not be able to stand. <br>
(Sisko wins his match) <br>
O'BRIEN: Not bad. <br>
SISKO: Captain of the Academy wrestling team. Twenty two years ago. Ow.
<br>
(Sisko massages his aching arm.) <br>
KLINGON: General Martok! <br>
WORF: Captain. <br>
SISKO: I see him. <br>
(The crowd cheer Martok as he walks through the hall.) <br>
0'BRIEN: What if he recognises us? <br>
ODO: We'll have come a long way for nothing. <br>
SISKO: Q'apla! <br>
ODO: Q'apla! <br>
WORF + O'BRIEN: Q'apla!
MARTOK: Q'apla. <br>
(And walks on to the wine barrel) <br>
WORF: If Martok is here, Gowron will not be far behind. <br>
SISKO: Let's get it done. <br>
(The four head off to place their emitters on various statues. A hand
falls on O'Brien's shoulder.) <br>
MARTOK: Hold on there. Don't I know you? <br>
O'BRIEN: I would be honoured to think so. <br>
MARTOK: I know we have met. <br>
O'BRIEN: I am Pahash of the House of Konjah. <br>
MARTOK: The name is not familiar to me, but there is something about
you. <br>
O'BRIEN: Perhaps we met on the battlefield. My regiment fought at
Mempa. <br>
MARTOK: Mempa! Many noble deeds were done on that dark day. <br>
O'BRIEN: And yours have become legend. <br>
MARTOK: Mempa. Yes, that must be it. <br>
O'BRIEN: After the ceremony would you honour me with a drink? <br>
MARTOK: We will salute the fallen. There is something very familiar
about this face. <br>
(Martok walks off, the group relaxes slightly and the emitters get
placed, except - ) <br>
DRUNK: Hey, where's Gowron? <br>
(Odo's emitter falls to the floor and rolls to the boot of - ) <br>
KLINGON: What is this? <br>
ODO: Get away from me or you won't live to see Gowron. (he elbows the
drunk) I'll take that. <br>
KLINGON: This looks like some sort of weapon. <br>
WORF: Kodrak, my brother. Ah, you found it. <br>
KLINGON: Found what? <br>
WORF: It's a tinghamut. <br>
KLINGON: A what? <br>
WORF: A Vulcan toy for children. <br>
ODO: The spoils of war from the raid on Archanis. <br>
WORF: If you want one, you will have to find your own. <br>
(Worf takes the emitter from the Klingon and hands it to Odo.) <br>
WORF: Give this to your son. <br>
ODO: I'll make sure he gets it. <br>
(Drums start up. Enter Gowron and guards, to great jubilation. As
Gowron stands on the stage, Odo goes to set up his emitter.) <br>
MARTOK: Long live Gowron! Long live the Empire! <br>
GOWRON: Klingon Warriors, I salute you. At least, those of you still on
your feet! <br>
(The comatose drunks are being dragged from the hall.) <br>
GOWRON: This is a great day for the Empire, a day when we honour you
who have brought us glory, whose deeds of valour will live on in song
and story. And so now, here in this hallowed hall, under the watchful
gaze of our greatest heroes, you will receive the highest honour that
can be bestowed upon a Klingon. The Order of the Bat'leth! <br>
(A young warrior takes a vantage point just where Odo wants to put his
emitter.) <br>
MARTOK: Come forward, H'Ta, son of Kahmar. <br>
GOWRON: Glory to you and your house. <br>
(Gowron pins the medal on H'Ta.) <br>
ODO: This is my place. Step down. <br>
YOUNG KLINGON: Find another. <br>
MARTOK: Come forward, T'vis, son of Barot. <br>
ODO: That won't be necessary. <br>
(Odo tosses the lad of his pedestal) <br>
GOWRON: Glory to you and your house. <br>
MARTOK: Come forward, Huss, daughter of A'trom. <br>
(The last emitter is in place.) <br>
GOWRON: Glory to you and your house. <br>
MARTOK: Come forward, Jodmos, son of Kobor. <br>
(Sisko puts the remote away, Worf puts his hand on his disruptor
handle.) <br>
GOWRON: Glory to you and your house. <br>
(Sisko receives the medal and walks away to trigger the emitters, when
Martok hits him from behind with a bat'leth.) <br>
MARTOK: Captain Benjamin Sisko. I knew I recognised that face. Seal the
room! It seems we have some uninvited guests.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Sisko, Odo, O'Brien and Worf are in the same cell)
<br>
MARTOK: Captain, you have no idea how much I've looked forward to
killing you in battle. And now your foolishness has cheated me of that
pleasure. <br>
SISKO: I'm sorry to disappoint you. <br>
MARTOK: Leave us. You heard me! <br>
(The guards leave) <br>
MARTOK: Don't you understand you've thrown your lives away for nothing?
Or did you really think you could fool us into believing that
Chancellor Gowron was a Dominion spy? <br>
ODO: Gowron is the one who's fooling you. And as long as you follow
him, the Empire will be nothing but a pawn of the Founders. <br>
MARTOK: Where's your proof? <br>
WORF: You want proof? Take our polaron emitters and use them on Gowron.
<br>
MARTOK: Gowron had your equipment destroyed. <br>
O'BRIEN: Of course he did. He had to make sure he couldn't be tested. <br>
MARTOK: Captain, your mission was a failure. For that, you deserve to
die. <br>
SISKO: Would you be happier if we'd succeeded? <br>
MARTOK: I am a loyal officer of the Empire. <br>
SISKO: You think we're right, don't you? You believe Gowron's a
changeling too. <br>
MARTOK: That would be treason. <br>
WORF: Since when is it treasonous to act in the best interests of the
Empire? <br>
SISKO: How long have you suspected? <br>
MARTOK: Months. I've known Gowron a long time. And it is no secret that
we have not always agreed on the way he runs the Empire. He is a
politician, too eager to compromise, too eager to talk. Last year, he
stopped the attack on Deep Space Nine instead of going to war with the
Federation. And then he changed. Suddenly he was the one calling for
war. <br>
O'BRIEN: I would have thought that would make you happy. <br>
MARTOK: At first it did, but after the war began he started ignoring
the counsel of his generals, throwing aside all wisdom in his pursuit
of victory. Our losses continue to mount and still he listens to no
one. <br>
ODO: No one but the Founders. <br>
MARTOK: There is only one certain way to expose Gowron for what he
really is, to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is a changeling.
Gowron must die. <br>
ODO: Once he's dead, he'll revert to his natural form and all doubt
will be eliminated. <br>
WORF: You could challenge him to honourable combat. <br>
MARTOK: There will be no honourable combat, no formal challenges. I
will release you and help you reach the Hall of Warriors, and then you
will kill him.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARTOK: The prisoners will come with me for further
interrogation. <br>
GUARD: General, I have strict orders from Gowron himself. The prisoners
are not to leave this cell. <br>
MARTOK: I see. Well, we wouldn't want to disobey the Chancellor. <br>
(Martok turns then disintegrates the guard. Sisko knocks out the second
one) <br>

WORF: It is your death. <br>
(Gowron and Worf duel. Sisko shoots a Klingon who aims a gun at Worf.
Gowron knocks out another who gets up on the stage to help.) <br>
GOWRON: No. Lower your weapons. If this traitor wants a fight, I will
give him one. You want to kill me, Worf? You're welcome to try.

shoot him? <br>
ODO: I have a better question. Why isn't Gowron letting his bodyguards
kill Worf? I'll tell you why. Klingon honour. A concept you should be
very familiar with. My people, on the other hand, don't care about
honour. How did you put it? There will be no honourable combat, no
formal challenges. Hardly the words of a Klingon. Tell me, General, did
Gowron destroy the polaron emitters or did you?

deliver the death blow when) <br>
ODO: Worf, stop! <br>
(Odo and Martok are fighting.) <br>
ODO: Martok's the changeling. <br>
(Martok morphs a tentacle to strangle Odo. Sisko fires his disrupter.
The others join in and Martok turns into goo then explodes.) <br>
SISKO: Well, looks like we found our changeling after all. <br>
(Later) <br>
GOWRON: So the Founders mislead Odo into thinking I was a spy, hoping
that you'd eliminate me and pave the way for that thing imitating
Martok to take over the Empire. <br>
SISKO: That way the war between the Federation and the Klingons would
continue until both sides were destroyed. <br>
GOWRON: Leaving the Alpha Quadrant wide open for a Dominion invasion. <br>
ODO: That seems to have been their plan. <br>
SISKO: And we played right into it. <br>
GOWRON: But they sorely underestimated Odo here. <br>
ODO: Thank you. <br>
SISKO: If we really want to strike a blow against the Founders, we have
to find a way to end this war. <br>
GOWRON: That may not be possible. <br>
WORF: Why not? You told us that the Martok changeling was the one who
pushed for the attack on the Federation. <br>
GOWRON: True, but if your Klingon blood wasn't so thin you'd know that
once battle has begun, there can be no turning back. You want the war
to end, then the Federation must allow us to annex Archanis and the
other worlds we've seized. <br>
SISKO: I wouldn't count on it. But if the fighting stops and the
negotiations begin <br>
GOWRON: Ah, yes. Talk. <br>
ODO: That's right. Talk. The last thing the Dominion wants. <br>
GOWRON: I will call a meeting of the High Council, advise a temporary
cease fire. <br>
SISKO: Where Gowron leads the Council will follow. <br>
GOWRON: Perhaps. I'll see to it that you're safely delivered back to
that space station of yours. <br>
SISKO: I'd appreciate that. <br>
GOWRON: You have done a great service to the Empire. For that I thank
you. As for you, (to Worf) you should have killed me when you had the
chance. I promise you won't get another.

SISKO: I don't know. I could do without ridges but I kind of miss the
fangs. That leaves you, Odo. <br>
ODO: It's about time. I, for one, won't miss the fangs at all. <br>
