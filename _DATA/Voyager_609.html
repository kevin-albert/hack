get you? Some er, some coffee, tea? Oh wait a minute, don't, don't tell
me. Chocolate ice cream. <br>
TROI: You know me too well. But just one scoop, I'm watching my figure.

disappointed I didn't invite him to come along. <br>
BARCLAY: Yes, well, I, I was hoping to get, get together with him
too, er, before the Enterprise leaves orbit, but I just wanted to spend
time with you first. That's all right, isn't it? <br>

BARCLAY:&nbsp;Neelix! He's not used to company.
It's not polite to eat our guest's food. If you're hungry, just say so.
Deanna, Neelix. <br>
TROI: Neelix. That's an unusual name. Maybe we should introduce him to
Data's cat, Spot. I have a feeling you didn't ask me here to reminisce.
Tell me what's wrong. <br>
BARCLAY: I've lost myself, Deanna. <br>
TROI: Lost yourself? <br>
BARCLAY: In Voyager. I've become obsessed with Voyager. Here you are on
shore leave and what do I do? I lure you into a counselling session. <br>
TROI: Don't worry about that. The important thing is, I'm here now and
I want to help. <br>
BARCLAY: Thank you. <br>
TROI: Now, start at the beginning. <br>
BARCLAY: Has it ever occurred to you that a tachyon beam directed at a
class B itinerant pulsar could produce enough gravimetric energy to
create an artificial singularity? <br>
TROI: I can't say it has. <br>
BARCLAY: It occurred to me. But my supervisors thought it was an abuse
of MIDAS. <br>
TROI: MIDAS? <br>

ADMIRAL PARIS [OC]: Voyager, come in. Come in, Voyager. Voyager, come
in, this is Starfleet Command. Voyager, come in, Voyager. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">HARKINS:
What theory? <br>
BARCLAY: I've been going over the interstellar phenomena forecasts from
Deep Space Nine. They are predicting er, a class B itinerant pulsar
will pass within four billion kilometers of the MIDAS array in three
days. <br>
HARKINS: You think the pulsar might damage the array? <br>
BARCLAY: No, no. The shields will hold. Actually I was thinking, we
could use the pulsar to our own advantage. <br>
HARKINS: How? <br>
BARCLAY: Suppose, suppose we instructed the array to direct a tachyon
beam at the pulsar. Theoretically, we could produce a gravimetric surge
powerful enough to create an artificial wormhole. We could establish
two way communication with Voyager. <br>
HARKINS: Reg, you're dreaming again. <br>
BARCLAY: No, no, I really think this could work. Based on my
simulations that <br>
HARKINS: Based on your last series of simulations, we wasted six months
trying to develop that transwarp probe. <br>
BARCLAY: This, this is different. This<br>
HARKINS: Reg, I really appreciate your imagination. It's what makes you
such a valuable part of this team. But I'm not about to tell the
Admiral that we've found a way for him to chat with his son because of
some cock-eyed theory that only exists up here. Now please, finish
those diagnostics. <br>
BARCLAY: Yes, sir. <br>
HARKINS: And, Reg, remember, while the Admiral's here, I do the talking.
<br>
BARCLAY: You do the talking. Understood. <br>
BARCLAY [OC]: Pete was only trying to look out for me, but I was sure
my plan would work. I just couldn't give it up. <br>(Later.)<br>HARKINS:
Burning the midnight oil? <br>
BARCLAY: I, I finished, er, the diagnostics, sir. <br>
HARKINS: Yes. I know. I looked them over. Good job. Now, why don't you
call it a day? <br>
BARCLAY: I just, er, have a few more things to take care of. <br>
HARKINS: Well, see you tomorrow, then. Oh,. Reg, why don't, why don't
you drop by tonight when you're through here? <br>
BARCLAY: Drop by? <br>
HARKINS: Come to the house. Have some coffee. Angie's sister's in from
Boston. I, er I think she might like you. <br>
BARCLAY: I, I don't, I don't think I can er. I'm spending the evening
with, er, Neelix. <br>
HARKINS: Correct me if I'm wrong, Reg, but Neelix is your cat. Well, if
you change your mind. <br>
BARCLAY: Thanks. I'll try.&nbsp;<br>
BARCLAY [OC]: But I couldn't leave. Not until I'd strengthened my case
for accessing the MIDAS array. The meeting with Admiral Paris was only
fourteen hours away and I hadn't come up with anything. Poring over the

we're going to find a more permanent solution. <br>

from every angle, or is there something else I should be trying? Am I
doing enough? <br>

The Delta Quadrant, sector 41751, grid nine. Voyager's doctor reported
this as the ship's position when his programme was briefly transferred
to Starfleet two years ago. Assuming they're still on course for Earth,
we've been able to extrapolate a range of likely trajectories.
Estimating an average warp speed of six point two, and accounting for
various astronomical obstacles, we can reasonably assume that Voyager
is now in one of these three sectors. <br>
ADMIRAL PARIS: Can we contact them? <br>
HARKINS: As you know, we've been working with the Vulcans on the
deployment of the MIDAS array. Though we're still in the testing phase,
we think it won't be long before we can use this technology to send
signals at hyper-subspace speeds. A message that would normally take
years to reach its destination could be received by Voyager in a matter
of days. <br>
ADMIRAL PARIS: Impressive. Will they be able to respond? <br>
HARKINS: No sir, but at least they'll know we're still looking for them.
We'll send data on the hyper-subspace technology and hope they can
eventually use it to return the call. <br>
BARCLAY: Excuse me, Admiral Paris. <br>
HARKINS: Lieutenant Barclay. <br>
BARCLAY: I'm sorry, Commander, it's just that there may be a way to
establish, er, two-way communication with Voyager. <br>

all ears, son. <br>

pulsar, er, and we well, as you probably know, sir, sir, neutrino
emissions, ah. Oh, what I mean to say is that with the array, we could
open an artificial er, s, a sing, singularity. <br>
ADMIRAL PARIS: A wormhole? <br>
BARCLAY: Yes, yes, sir. We could use it as a conduit to to talk to
Voyager. <br>
ADMIRAL PARIS: I can't give you high marks for clarity, Lieutenant, but
you've certainly got my attention. Is there any merit to what he's
saying? <br>
HARKINS: Mister Barclay has a tendency to get ahead of himself, sir.
Unfortunately, what he's suggesting is beyond our abilities. <br>
BARCLAY: But you haven't even <br>
HARKINS: Mister Barclay. <br>
BARCLAY: I know that I haven't explained myself very well, but with all
due respect, sir, what do we have to lose by trying? I think we're
forgetting that there are a hundred and fifty people stranded in the
Delta Quadrant. <br>
ADMIRAL PARIS: I have a son on that ship, Lieutenant. I haven't
forgotten that fact for a single moment. <br>

with a specific plan. And I've done that, Pete. You were right about the
wormhole idea being too expansive. So I've, I've scaled it back. <br>

thought I was being a friend by giving you some leeway. I didn't
realise how involved you've become with Voyager. <br>

return to work. <br>
TROI: I can't do that. <br>
BARCLAY: Why not? <br>
TROI: Look at yourself. You're experiencing acute anxiety,
sleeplessness, paranoia. You did what you could. Now it's time to let
Starfleet worry about Voyager. We need to take care of you. <br>
BARCLAY: There is nothing wrong with me! <br>
TROI: You said yourself you've become obsessed with Voyager. <br>
BARCLAY: What if I have? If an obsession helps me to do my job better,
it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. A little instability in exchange
for contact with a stranded starship. Isn't Voyager more important than
my psychological condition? <br>
TROI: Voyager is important, but so are you. <br>
BARCLAY: That ship, that crew, they're all I have. <br>
TROI: Tell me why that is. <br>
BARCLAY: Ever, ever since I, I left the Enterprise, things haven't,
haven't been the same. It's as if I lost my family. <br>
TROI: So you created a new family on the holodeck. Only they're not
real. <br>
BARCLAY: I didn't know how else, how else to cope. <br>
TROI: Do you remember when you first came aboard the Enterprise? You
had trouble fitting in, didn't you? But after a while you started to
make friends. You can learn to do the same thing here on Earth. <br>
BARCLAY: Oh, I, I don't know how. <br>
TROI: We'll work on it together. <br>
BARCLAY: You're scheduled to depart tomorrow. <br>
TROI: I've decided to ask Captain Picard for a temporary leave of
absence. To spend some time with an old friend. <br>
BARCLAY: Oh, Deanna, you, you, you don't, you don't have to do that. <br>
TROI: Try and stop me. <br>(Later, Barclay wakes with Neelix lying on his chest.)<br>BARCLAY:
