remembers the USS Voyager's triumphant return to Earth after twenty
three years in the Delta Quadrant. Voyager captivated the hearts and

would be honoured to submit Korath's House for consideration.<br>

you're going to become intimately familiar with the Collective. You'll
learn about the assimilation process, the Borg hierarchy, and the
psychology of the hive mind. And when it comes to your performance in
this class, my expectations are going to be no different than the Borg
Queen herself. Perfection. This semester, we are very fortunate to have
a special guest lecturer. The woman who literally wrote the book on the
Borg. Admiral Kathryn Janeway.<br>

Unimatrix Zero.<br>

liberate thousands of her drones, could you describe the look on her

take you another sixteen years to get this ship home, and there are
going to be casualties along the way. I know exactly what you're

incredible. I hate to sound like Harry, but we might actually make it
this time. <br>
PARIS: Well, you don't seem too happy about that.<br>
TORRES: Oh, I'm happy. It's just that I'd actually gotten used to the
idea of raising our daughter on Voyager. And now I might end up
delivering her at Starfleet Medical instead of Sickbay. <br>
PARIS: That wouldn't be so bad, would it? <br>
TORRES: Not as long as you're with me. And I want the Doctor. I don't
want some stranger.<br>

PARIS: Well, we could always stay with my parents for a while. You're
right. Bad idea. <br>

fly boys are all the same. You'll probably take the first piloting

JANEWAY: You once told me there were only six of them in the galaxy. <br>

JANEWAY: You knew this was here, but you didn't tell me about it. Why? <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The armour is gone.)<br>SEVEN:
This hub connects with thousands of transwarp conduits with end points
in all four quadrants. It allows the Collective to deploy vessels
almost anywhere in the galaxy within minutes. <br>
TUVOK: Of all the Borg's tactical advantages, this could be the most
significant. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's no wonder the Queen didn't want us in that nebula. <br>
JANEWAY: So how do we destroy it? <br>
SEVEN: The structure is supported by a series of interspatial manifolds. If
we could disable enough of them, theoretically the hub would collapse. <br>
ADMIRAL: This is a waste of time. The shielding for those manifolds is
regulated from the central nexus by the Queen herself. You might be
able to damage one of them, maybe two. But by the time you moved onto
the third, she'd adapt. <br>
JANEWAY: There may be a way to bring them down simultaneously. <br>
ADMIRAL: From where, inside the hub? Voyager would be crushed like a
bug. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What about taking the conduit back to the Alpha Quadrant and
then destroying the structure from the other side? <br>
ADMIRAL: This hub is here. There's nothing in the Alpha Quadrant but
exit apertures. While you're all standing around dreaming up fantasy
tactical scenarios, the Queen is studying her scans of our armour and
weapons. And she's probably got the entire Collective working on a way
to counter them. So take the ship back into that nebula and go home
before it's too late. <br>

ADMIRAL: Because I remember how stubborn and self-righteous I used to
be. I figured you might try to do something stupid. <br>
JANEWAY: We have an opportunity to deal a crippling blow to the Borg.
It could save millions of lives. <br>
ADMIRAL: I didn't spend the last ten years looking for a way to get
this crew home earlier, so you could throw it all away on some
intergalactic goodwill mission. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe we should go back to Sickbay. <br>
ADMIRAL: Why, so you can have me sedated? <br>
JANEWAY: So I can have the Doctor reconfirm your identity. I refuse to

ADMIRAL: Am I the only one experiencing déjà vu here? <br>
JANEWAY: What are you talking about? <br>
ADMIRAL: Seven years ago you had the chance to use the Caretaker's
array to get Voyager home. Instead, you destroyed it. <br>
JANEWAY: I did what I knew was right. <br>
ADMIRAL: You chose to put the lives of strangers ahead of the lives of
your crew. You can't make the same mistake again. <br>
JANEWAY: You got Voyager home, which means I will too. If it takes a
few more years then that's<br>
ADMIRAL: Seven of Nine is going to die. <br>
JANEWAY: What? <br>
ADMIRAL: Three years from now. She'll be injured on an away mission.
She'll make it back to Voyager, and die in the arms of her husband. <br>
JANEWAY: Husband?<br>
ADMIRAL: Chakotay. He'll never be the same after Seven's death, and
neither will you. <br>
JANEWAY: If I know what's going to happen, I can avoid it.<br>
ADMIRAL: Seven isn't the only one. Between this day and the day I got
Voyager home, I lost twenty two crew members. And then of course
there's Tuvok. <br>
JANEWAY: What about him? <br>
ADMIRAL: You're forgetting the Temporal Prime Directive, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: The hell with it. <br>
ADMIRAL: Fine. Tuvok has a degenerative neurological condition that he
hasn't told you about. There's a cure in the Alpha Quadrant, but if he
doesn't get it in time. Even if you alter Voyager's route, limit your
contact with alien species, you're going to lose people. But I'm
offering you a chance to get all of them home safe and sound today. Are
you really going to walk away from that? </font></p>

Your concern is appreciated, Captain, but premature. It will be several
years before the symptoms become serious. Until then, the Doctor can
manage my condition with medication. <br>
JANEWAY: Is it true what the Admiral said? That there's a cure in the
Alpha Quadrant?<br>
TUVOK: It is called a fal-tor-voh, and it requires a mind meld with
another Vulcan. <br>
JANEWAY: What about the other Vulcans on Voyager? <br>
TUVOK: None of them are compatible. <br>
JANEWAY: But members of your family are? If you knew that returning to
the Alpha Quadrant was your only chance for recovery, why didn't you
object when I asked you to help find a way to destroy the hub? <br>
TUVOK: My sense of logic isn't impaired yet. If we succeed, millions of
lives will be saved. <br>

ADMIRAL: I'm not asking you to. I simply want you to tell her that in
your opinion, destroying the hub is too risky, the cost too high.<br>
SEVEN: I can't do that. <br>
ADMIRAL: Even if it means avoiding the consequences I mentioned?<br>
SEVEN: Now that I know about those consequences, they're no longer a
certainty. But even if they were, my death would be a small price to
pay for the destruction of the transwarp network. <br>
ADMIRAL: I have known you for a long time, Seven. Longer than you've
known yourself. You are thinking that collapsing the network is an
opportunity to atone for atrocities you participated in while you were
a drone. It's time to let go of the past and start thinking about your

Once inside, we'd fire a spread of transphasic torpedoes. <br>
SEVEN: They'd be programmed to detonate simultaneously. <br>
TUVOK: If the torpedoes penetrate the shielding, the conduits should
begin to collapse in a cascade reaction. In order to avoid the shock
wave, we'd have less than ten seconds to exit the hub. <br>
JANEWAY: A long time ago, I made a decision that stranded this crew in
the Delta Quadrant. I don't regret that decision. But I didn't know all
of you then, and Voyager was just a starship. It's much more than that
now. It's become our home. I know I could order you to carry out this
plan and none of you would hesitate for a second, but I'm not going to
do that. You know the crewmen who work under you, and you know what
your own hearts are telling you. So we're not going to attempt this
unless everyone in this room agrees. No one will think less of you if
you don't. <br>
KIM: Captain?<br>
JANEWAY: Go ahead, Harry. <br>
KIM: I think it's safe to say that no one on this crew has been more
obsessed with getting home than I have. But, when I think about
everything we've been through together, maybe it's not the destination
that matters. Maybe it's the journey. And if that journey takes a little
longer so we can do something we all believe in, I can't think of
any place I'd rather be, or any people I'd rather be with. <br>

they were to you. It's taken me a few days to realise it. This is your
