anything. <br>

You're back. I was beginning to worry. <br>
SEVEN: The survey took longer than expected. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Lucky our deuterium shortage is no longer an issue. <br>
SEVEN: A wormhole. <br>
KIM: The wormhole. It leads all the way back to Earth. <br>
SEVEN: The odds of finding such a phenomenon are infinitesimal. <br>
JANEWAY: Never bet against the house. <br>
KIM: What are you doing? <br>
SEVEN: Looking for anomalous readings. <br>
TUVOK: You will find none. <br>
CHAKOTAY: He's right. No subspatial contortions, no temporal
variance.&nbsp;<br>
JANEWAY: The probe we sent in has already picked up faint signals from
the other side.&nbsp;<br>
KIM: B'Elanna's still downloading them, but she's pretty sure they're
from Starfleet. <br>
SEVEN: This wormhole is only three hundred million kilometres away.
Long range scans should have detected it days ago. <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps it was an oversight on your part. <br>
JANEWAY: If it'll make you feel better, run a diagnostic. In the
meantime, let's maintain course.

Come in. <br>
SEVEN: I completed my diagnostic. Sensors are operating at peak
efficiency. <br>
JANEWAY: Then there's nothing to worry about. <br>
SEVEN: On the contrary. The wormhole's neutrino levels are extremely
erratic. <br>
JANEWAY: I thought so too, until I received this. It turns out those
faint signals we detected were communiqu√©s from Starfleet. They assure
me the neutrino flux is nothing to worry about. <br>
SEVEN: Starfleet may be in error. We should run further scans. <br>
JANEWAY: No time. The wormhole might destabilise. <br>
SEVEN: The Doctor often instructs me to look before I leap. It is an
antiquated adage, but I believe it is relevant. <br>
JANEWAY: I have another one for you. He who hesitates is lost. <br>
SEVEN: Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: I thin we're avoiding the real issue here, Seven. You're still
feeling uncomfortable about returning to the Alpha Quadrant. It's
nothing to be ashamed of. Trust me, you're going to thrive on Earth,
just as you've thrived on Voyager. Yes? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Letter number two. I'm getting jealous. <br>
JANEWAY: Mark. Apparently his engagement was broken off. What about
you, any news? <br>
CHAKOTAY: A full pardon and reinstatement to Starfleet. I've even been
offered a professorship in anthropology at the Academy. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, Chakotay, congratulations, but it's not fair. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Don't worry, it's only part time. <br>

not be what it appears to be, she seemed unconcerned. <br>

SEVEN: You are familiar with this lifeform. <br>
QATAI: Familiar? I‚Äôve been hunting it for nearly forty years. <br>
SEVEN: And have you become impervious to its telepathy? <br>
QATAI: Almost, but there are days when he can still trick me. Like
yesterday. I thought I had found a way to kill him once and for all.
I'd allow him to begin consuming my ship and then I'd fly directly to
his most vulnerable system, his primary neural plexus. Boom! I'd
destroy him from the inside out. But he knew. He showed me what I
wanted to see. I was nowhere near his neural plexus. I was flying
directly into his digestion chamber. And speaking of digestion. <br>
NAOMI: How do we get out of the monster? <br>
SEVEN: It's not a monster, it's a bioplasmic organism, and we will find
a way out. <br>
QATAI: No, the girl's right. He's a monster, and the only way out is to
destroy him.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH:
Please state the nature of the medical emergency. <br>
QATAI: Your ship is being devoured. I'd say that's an emergency. <br>
NAOMI: The monster ate his ship, too. <br>
EMH: Monster?<br>
QATAI: I want to see your weapons manifest. <br>
EMH: Weapons? This is a Sickbay, not an arsenal. What's going on? <br>
SEVEN: Voyager has been lured into the digestive chamber of a
bioplasmic organism. We require your assistance in charting an escape
route. <br>
EMH: Slow down. The last thing I remember I was speaking to Mister
Paris. He said the wormhole posed a threat to my programme. <br>
QATAI: The beast has been manipulating your crew. The moment he
realised you were beginning to suspect something, he made sure you were
deactivated. <br>
EMH: And who might you be, the local monster expert? <br>
QATAI: As a matter of fact I am. He's been fooling you for days,
creating false sensor readings, and he's been altering your crew's
thought patterns. A little neurogenic telepathy to make them lower
their guard. <br>
EMH: That might explain the heightened dopamine levels I found during
my routine examinations of the crew. Have you informed the Captain? <br>
NAOMI: She's asleep. <br>
EMH: Asleep? <br>
SEVEN: It's our proximity to the creature. The neurogenic field is
stronger here. It's already rendered most of the crew unconscious. Does
your vessel's database contain information on the creature's anatomy? <br>
QATAI: Of course. <br>
SEVEN: Retrieve it. <br>
EMH: In the meantime, let's work on a wake-up call for the crew. <br>(Torres is on a biobed with a cortical inhibitor on her neck.)<br>EMH:
Computer, increase neurotransmitter levels by twenty nine
percent.&nbsp;<br>
QATAI: A cortical inhibitor? <br>
EMH: I thought it might disrupt the organism's hold on her. <br>
QATAI: It won't. I already tried a similar procedure. <br>
EMH: I don't remember asking for a second opinion. It's working. She's
regaining consciousness. <br>
TORRES: Doctor? <br>
EMH: You're being exposed to a powerful neurogenic field. You've been
unconscious for several hours. <br>
TORRES: They're here. <br>
EMH: Who?<br>
TORRES: The Maquis, they're alive! <br>
EMH: B'Elanna, you're still on Voyager. You're hallucinating. <br>
TORRES: Starfleet thinks you've all been killed. <br>
EMH: Computer, increase neurotransmitter levels by another ten percent.
B'Elanna, focus on my voice.&nbsp;<br>
QATAI: She doesn't want to. <br>(The EMH knocks Torres out again.)<br>QATAI: They never want to.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">QATAI:
It's the silence I hate. The way he takes you without a fight. It was
the same way with the Nokaro. A crew of nearly three thousand. Families
mostly, mine included, looking for a New World to settle. But they came
across our friend here and he showed them what they wanted to see. A
glistening green paradise. By the time I responded to their distress
call, all that was left of them was some fading engine emissions. That
was thirty nine years ago. Thirty nine years, two weeks, four days. <br>
EMH: Do you mind? The situation is dismal enough. <br>
QATAI: I‚Äôm just trying to explain who we're up against. <br>
EMH: Well, I‚Äôm getting a pretty good idea on my own. Judging by these
bioscans, the organism's been devouring life forms for a bit longer
than thirty nine years. I'd estimate it's at least two hundred thousand
years old. <br>
QATAI: The intelligent always survive. <br>
EMH: I wouldn't go that far. It appears to operate on highly evolved
instinct. I haven't detected any signs of sentience. <br>
QATAI: Oh he's intelligent, all right. Smart enough to fool your crew
into taking you offline. <br>
EMH: No need to get personal.

into the creature's digestive tract and detonate one of these charges,
we might be able to destroy it. <br>
EMH: Starfleet's not in the habit of killing lifeforms. <br>
QATAI: Even if that lifeform is about to kill you? <br>
EMH: If I could take a few hours to examine the creature more
thoroughly<br>
SEVEN: There is no time. <br>
QATAI: We kill him! <br>
EMH: Maybe there's another way. <br>
SEVEN: Explain. <br>
EMH: Any living organism, no matter how large, will attempt to expel a
foreign body. If we could just make Voyager a little less tasty? <br>
SEVEN: My scans indicate that your weapons are tetryon based. If you
were to fire one at a pocket of antimatter released from our warp core,
it would produce an electrolytic reaction. <br>
NAOMI: Would that make Voyager taste bad? <br>
QATAI: It might at that.

Once I‚Äôve beamed you back to your ship, try adjusting your shields to
this frequency. You'll find them more resistant to the bioplasmic

QATAI: You seem to know a little about everything. Medicine,
exobiology, shield harmonics. <br>
EMH: I‚Äôm something of a renaissance EMH. <br>
QATAI: I could use a crewmate like you. The beast would have a
difficult time manipulating a hologram's desires. <br>

QATAI: You're turning down the hunt of a lifetime? <br>
