perceptual dysfunction in which aural and visual stimuli are
incorrectly processed by the brain. His actual thinking hasn't been
affected, but he's incapable of expressing himself or understanding
others. <br>

Mister O'Brien is aphasic, but all of his tests come up negative. <br>
DAX: Isn't aphasia typically associated with some kind of cranial
trauma? <br>
BASHIR: Yes. It can occur as a result of a stroke or blow to the head.
But there's no evidence of that here. <br>
DAX: Did you check the medical library for any precedents? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: Spontaneous development of aphasia is
virtually impossible. Yet we saw Lieutenant Dax become aphasic before
our eyes. This told me we are dealing with a disease that only mimics
aphasia. So I ran a full neurosynaptic comparison of Dax and O'Brien,
and I found this in the temporal lobes of both patients. <br>
SISKO: A virus? <br>
BASHIR: It imposes itself within the established synaptic pathways and
then randomly reroutes them. For example, when I look at this, (holds
up a tricorder) a process occurs in my brain which connects the
stimulus to the word tricorder. This virus disrupts that process. <br>
SISKO: I'd see a tricorder but I would say something ridiculous like
window. <br>

vary within each individual. <br>
