Act IV Scene 1, but with Alexander Court missing, along with some
dialogue) <br>
WILLIAMS: (Patrick Stewart with his Yorkshire accent) Brother John
Bates, is not that the morning which breaks yonder? <br>
BATES: I think it be, but we have no great cause to desire the approach
of day. <br>
WILLIAMS: Who's there? <br>
DATA: (as Henry) A friend. <br>
WILLIAMS: Under what captain serve you? <br>
DATA: Under Sir Thomas Erpingham. <br>
WILLIAMS: I pray you, what thinks he of our estate? <br>
DATA: Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be washed off the
next tide. <br>
BATES: He hath not told his thought to the king? <br>
DATA: No, nor it is not meet he should. For though I speak it to you, I
think the king is but a man, as I am. The violet smells to him as it
doth to me, in his nakedness he appears but a man. Therefore, his
fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are. Yet no man
should possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it,
should dishearten his army. <br>
BATES: He may show what outward courage he will, but I believe, as cold
a night as 'tis, he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck. <br>
DATA: Methinks I could not die anyplace so contented as in the King's
company, his cause being just and his quarrel honourable. <br>
WILLIAMS: That's more than we know. <br>
BATES: Or more than we should seek after. If his cause be wrong, our
obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us. <br>
WILLIAMS: But if the cause be not good, the King himself hath a heavy
reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in
a battle shall join together at the latter day and cry all, we died at
such a place. <br>
DATA: The King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his
soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant. <br>
PICARD: Splendid, Data. Splendid. You're getting better and better. <br>
DATA: Freeze programme. Thank you, sir. I plan to study the
performances of Olivier, Branagh, Shapiro, Kullnark <br>
PICARD: Data, you're here to learn about the human condition and there
is no better way of doing that than by embracing Shakespeare. But you
must discover it through your own performance, not by imitating others.

Cheron has not been forgotten. The new leaders have vowed to discard
the treaty and claim the Neutral Zone. Nelvana Three is just the first
step. <br>
RIKER: You're saying an entire base has already been established there?
<br>
SETAL: In forty-eight hours, the reactor core will be online. <br>
RIKER: So the Federation sensors that monitor the Neutral Zone just
missed it? <br>
SETAL: It would seem so. In two days, a fleet of Romulan warbirds will
be within striking distance of fifteen Federation sectors. <br>
WORF: The Federation will not permit that. <br>
SETAL: Then it is war that we're talking about, isn't it? Destroy the
base now and the threat is over. <br>

medical attention. Lieutenant Worf, will you accompany Sublieutenant
Setal to the Sickbay. We will attend to your quarters. <br>

RIKER: He tells a hell of a story. <br>
PICARD: You don't believe it? <br>
RIKER: The Empire knows that we'd never allow them to maintain a base
within the Neutral Zone. <br>
DATA: Commander, that would not be an atypical Romulan ploy. In their
long history of war, the Romulans have rarely attacked first. They
prefer to test their enemy's resolve. <br>
RIKER: I think he's a plant to draw us into the Neutral Zone. Then
we'll look like the aggressors. <br>
PICARD: And the Romulans would have a legitimate excuse for responding
in force. <br>
RIKER: Exactly. <br>
DATA: That would also not be an atypical Romulan ploy, sir. <br>
PICARD: It's always a chess game with them, isn't it? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, at least he's given us the chance to get a look at some
Romulan technology close up. <br>

RIKER: Excuse me for being a little confused, Setal, but I thought you

Federation Council has convened in emergency session. There is no doubt
in my mind that this will eventually fall on your shoulders, Jean-Luc.

DATA: Am I correct in assuming you regret your decision to come here? <br>
SETAL: What I did had to be done. But to never again see the firefalls
of Gath Gal'thong, and the spires of my home as they rise above the
Apnex Sea at dawn. It's a bitter thing to be exiled from your home. <br>
DATA: It does appear unlikely you will ever be allowed to return to
your planet. <br>
SETAL: The cold reaction of an android. <br>
DATA: But perhaps we can bring Romulus to you.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ready room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HADEN [on monitor]: Captain, we have confirmed that
you are holding Admiral Alidar Jarok. He has been identified as the
commander at the massacre at the Norkan outposts. The Council strongly
advises that you to consider Jarok an unreliable source of information.
<br>
PICARD: Bring him in. <br>
(Setal, now Jarok, enters with a guard) <br>
PICARD: Ensign, will you wait outside? Have a seat, Admiral Jarok. <br>
JAROK: Captain, there is no more time. <br>
PICARD: Admiral, have a seat. You see, I'm just not convinced that you
are telling the truth. <br>
JAROK: What must I do? <br>
PICARD: You must convince me. If I had irrefutable evidence? But you
did not bring irrefutable evidence. You brought no evidence at all.
Now, here, you are not the man you claimed to be. Admiral, your
credibility is stretched beyond belief. A Romulan defector is almost a
contradiction in terms. But Admiral Jarok crossing the lines? <br>
JAROK: I explained my motives to your interrogators. <br>
PICARD: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Peace in our galaxy. Except, Admiral,
you are not a man of peace. Your military record, what we know of it,
is clear. <br>
JAROK: which is precisely why I chose an alternate identity here. <br>
PICARD: The massacres in the Norkan outposts, for example. <br>
JAROK: What you call massacres were called the Norkan Campaign on my
world, Captain. One world's butcher is another world's hero. Perhaps I
am neither one. <br>
PICARD: On what basis, Admiral, am I to decide? Your good word? Are you
willing to help us overpower the Romulan B-type warbirds we may
encounter? Are you prepared to help us detect them through their
cloaking shields? You see my problem, Admiral. You ask us for faith in
circumstances which are hardly possible to believe, compounded by lies
and your refusal to tell us all you know. <br>
JAROK: I cannot betray my people. <br>
PICARD: You've already betrayed your people, Admiral. You've made your
choices, sir. You're a traitor. Now, if the bitter taste of that is
unpalatable to you, I am truly sorry. But I will not risk the lives of
my crew because you think you can dance on the edge of the Neutral
Zone. You've crossed over, Admiral. You make yourself comfortable with
that. <br>
JAROK: Do you have any children, Captain Picard? A family? <br>
PICARD: No. <br>
JAROK: Then you have sacrificed too much for your career. <br>
PICARD: Yes, this is all very interesting. <br>
JAROK: There comes a time in a man's life that you cannot know. When he
looks down at the first smile of his baby girl and realises he must
change the world for her. For all children. It is for her that I am
here. Not to destroy the Romulan Empire, but to save it. For months, I
tried desperately to persuade the High Command that another war would
destroy the Empire. They got tired of my arguments. Finally I was
censured, sent off to command some distant sector. This was my only
recourse. I will never see my child smile again. She will grow up
believing that her father is a traitor. But she will grow up. If you
act, Picard. If we stop the war before it begins <br>
PICARD: I can't. And I won't. Unless I have unequivocal cooperation.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Admiral Jarok has provided me with the
locations, strengths and tactical plans of the Romulan fleet.
Mister La Forge, he is prepared to give you data regarding engines,
weapons and the cloaking systems of the warbird class
starship. But I believe his experience as a field commander will be
more valuable for its strategic sense than in the technical areas. <br>
LAFORGE: Any edge'll help, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Don't depend on it. For all we know, he may still be lying, but
we shall find that out soon enough. Number One, set course for Nelvana

WORF: Nothing on sensors. <br>
RIKER: I don't like it I would've expected a greeting party. <br>
PICARD: You echo another noteworthy commander in a similar
circumstances, Number One. A countryman of yours, George Armstrong
Custer when his Seventh Cavalry arrived at the Little Big Horn. <br>
RIKER: May we have better luck. <br>
DATA: Approaching Nelvana system. <br>
PICARD: Engage impulse engines. <br>
RIKER: Nelvana Three on screen. Still no sign of them on sensors. In a
way, I'd rather be fighting my way this, It's just too damned easy. <br>
PICARD: Prepare to enter standard orbit. Data? <br>
DATA: Scanning the planet, sir. No life forms, no power sources, no
weapons systems. <br>
RIKER: No indication of a base at all? <br>
DATA: No, sir. <br>
PICARD: The subspace signal the probe detected? The ionisation
disturbances? <br>
DATA: I am picking them up, sir, but I cannot identify the source. They
seem to be moving in an orbital path with an eight hundred kilometre
apogee. <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant Worf, bring the Admiral up here. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
RIKER: Maybe they abandoned the planet after he defected. <br>
DATA: There is no scarring on the planet surface that would denote
heavy construction of any kind. <br>
RIKER: A cloaking device of some sort, to hide the entire base? <br>
DATA: A cloaking device operating on the surface would be given away by
visible distortion effects. <br>
(Jarok and his escort enter) <br>
PICARD: Perhaps you'd care to explain why we're here, Admiral. <br>
RIKER: There doesn't appear to be a base. <br>
JAROK: I don't understand. <br>
PICARD: Nelvana Three, Admiral. No base, no weapons, no sign of any
life at all. <br>
JAROK: But I saw the tactical communiqués. The records. Timetables for
completion. An entire legion was assigned to the section. <br>
PICARD: Is it possible they could have been feeding you disinformation?
You said that you had been censured. Reassigned, four months ago. They
knew of your dissatisfaction. Could all this have been to test your
loyalty? <br>
JAROK: No. No. It's impossible. <br>
PICARD: They let you escape with an arsenal of worthless secrets. What
other explanation is there? <br>
RIKER: Permission to withdraw from the Neutral Zone? <br>
PICARD: At your earliest convenience, Number One. <br>
RIKER: Helm, bring her round one hundred and eighty degrees. Geordi,
get us out of here. <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: I hear you, Commander. <br>
WORF: Two Romulan warships uncloaking. Coordinates <br>

wouldn't be here talking about it. <br>
WORF: The Romulans are hailing us. <br>
PICARD: On screen. <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Captain Picard, I hardly expected to see you
again so soon. It seems this time you are the one who has made an
aggressive move across the Neutral Zone. <br>
PICARD: Commander Tomalak, as I'm sure you already know, we were
responding to a warnings of Romulan incursions at Nelvana Three. <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: But, Captain, as you can see, there is no
incursion. <br>
PICARD: And the matter of the unidentified subspace radio emissions,
and the ionisation
disturbances? <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Ah, you must mean our orbiting probe. We are
studying Nelvana Three for archaeological research. <br>
PICARD: With a cloaked satellite? <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Really, Captain, would you have us believe
this satellite is an excuse for your aggressive charge across the
Neutral Zone? <br>
PICARD: You can believe what you wish. We will be on our way. <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Without even an apology, Captain? <br>
PICARD: If an apology will do, then I offer it. <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: I'm afraid it won't, so I will save you the
humiliation. <br>
PICARD: Get to it, Tomalak. <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: You see, Picard, after we dissect your
Enterprise for every precious bit of information, I intend to display
its broken hull in the centre of the Romulan capitol as a symbol of our
victory. It will inspire our armies for generations
to come, and serve as a warning to any other traitor who would create
ripples of disloyalty. <br>
JAROK: All the communiqués, all the timetables, all the records. They
were all fiction, written for my benefit. A test. A test of my loyalty.
And you used me to lure the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone. <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: First, Captain, you will return the traitor
Jarok, then you will surrender as prisoners of war. <br>
PICARD: Do you seriously expect me to accept those terms? <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: No, Captain Picard, I expect you won't. You
have thirty seconds to decide. <br>
PICARD: I do not require one, Tomalak. <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: I urge you, Captain Picard, surrender.
Consider the men and women you would lead into a lost cause. <br>
PICARD: If the cause is just and honourable, they are prepared to give
their lives. Are you prepared to die today, Tomalak? <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: I expected more from you than an idle threat,
Picard. <br>
PICARD: Then you shall have it. Mister Worf. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
(Three mean Klingon vessels uncloak around the Enterprise and Romulans)
<br>
WORF: Klingon warships armed and ready, sir. <br>
PICARD: What shall it be, Tomalak? <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: You will still not survive our assault. <br>
PICARD: You will not survive ours. Shall we die together? <br>
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: I look forward to our next meeting, Captain. <br>
WORF: Romulan disruptors powering down, sir. <br>
(The warbirds cloak and leave) <br>
PICARD: Cancel red alert. Mister Worf, will you extend the appreciation
of the Federation and my personal gratitude to the Klingons. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Take us back, Number One. <br>
