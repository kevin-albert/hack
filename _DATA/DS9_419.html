annoyed the grown-ups. All inner deflector shield sub-systems are
showing equal intensity. <br>
DAX: Power balance levels are reading normal. I was a champion window
breaker. On a dark night with a few rocks, I was deadly. <br>
KIRA: Er, which you are you talking about? <br>
DAX: We're being hailed by an incoming freighter. <br>
KIRA: Open a channel. On screen. Welcome to DS Nine. I'm Major Kira
Nerys. <br>
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: This is the Kobheerian freighter Rak-Miunis,
requesting permission to dock. <br>
KIRA: Docking port six is clear for approach. <br>
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: Thank you. We have a passenger on board
requiring medical assistance. <br>
SISKO: Can you tell us what's wrong with your passenger? <br>
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: He says it's a condition called Kalla-Nohra.
It's apparently chronic, but he doesn't have his medication. <br>
SISKO: Beam him directly to our Infirmary. we'll have our doctor
standing by. <br>
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: Thank you, Commander. Rak-Miunis out. <br>
DAX: Dax to Infirmary. <br>
BASHIR [OC]: This is Bashir. Go ahead. <br>
DAX: A Kobheerian transport's about to beam a patient to you. He's
suffering from something called Kalla-Nohra. <br>
BASHIR [OC]: I'm not aware of it. I'll check the computer. <br>
KIRA: Commander, I'd like to go down to the Infirmary and meet that
patient. <br>
SISKO: Of course. Why? <br>
KIRA: The only cases of Kalla-Nohra I know of were the result of a
mining accident at a Bajoran forced labour camp I helped liberate. The
survivors of Gallitep have always been a symbol to us of strength and
courage. <br>
SISKO: By all means, Major. Take as much time as you want.

ODO: Good afternoon. I assume this is the problem? <br>
MARRITZA: Problem? <br>
KIRA: Lock him up. <br>
MARRITZA: This is outrageous. On what charge? <br>
BASHIR: Will someone tell me what's going on? This man needs medical
care. <br>
KIRA: Then give it to him in his cell. <br>
MARRITZA: I haven't done anything. <br>
ODO: Then why did you run? <br>
MARRITZA: I'm trying to get away from this Bajoran fanatic. Look at the
hate in her eyes. She'd like to kill me. <br>
ODO: Oh? And why would that be? <br>
MARRITZA: Well, it's obvious. I'm a Cardassian. <br>
KIRA: He's not just any Cardassian. He's a war criminal.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Security office]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: You're saying this man, what's his name? <br>
ODO: Marritza. Aamin Marritza. <br>
SISKO: You're saying Marritza's on the Bajoran's list of Cardassians
wanted for war crimes? <br>
ODO: He's not on any list I've seen, Commander, and I've got them all. <br>
KIRA: I don't care if he's listed or not. <br>
SISKO: Hold on, Major. Marritza's travelling on a Federation ship. He
comes here for a medical emergency, and we throw him into a security
cell. I, for one, hope he's listed. <br>
KIRA: Commander, I know what I've done isn't exactly policy. It may not
even be legal. But it's right. <br>
SISKO: All right, Major, what do we charge him with? <br>
KIRA: I'm charging him with having contracted Kalla-Nohra. <br>
SISKO: Do you want to explain that to me? <br>
KIRA: The only way he could have contracted that condition was to have
served at the Gallitep labour camp at the time of the mining accident. <br>
SISKO: So that makes him a war criminal, just being there? <br>
KIRA: Commander, if you'd been there twelve years ago when we liberated
that camp, if you'd seen the things I saw. All those Bajoran bodies
starved, brutalised. Do you know what Cardassian policy was? Oh, I'm
not even talking about the murder. Murder was just the end of the fun
for them. First came the humiliation, mothers raped in front of their
children, husbands beaten till their wives couldn't recognise them, old
people buried alive because they couldn't work anymore. <br>
SISKO: I think I'll have a talk with our guest. <br>
KIRA: I'll come with you. <br>
SISKO: No, Major. It'd be better if I spoke to him alone.

MARRITZA: Better, thank you. <br>
SISKO: I'm Benjamin Sisko. I'm in charge of this station. <br>
MARRITZA: Oh, finally, the Federation to the rescue. Are you going to
let me out of here? <br>
SISKO: I hope so. Tell me, how did you contract Kalla-Nohra syndrome? <br>
MARRITZA: I don't have Kalla-Nohra. I have Pottrik Syndrome. <br>
SISKO: The freighter captain said it was Kalla-Nohra. <br>
MARRITZA: A very similar condition. Take the same medication, as a
matter of fact. <br>
SISKO: Then you didn't serve at the Gallitep labour camp? <br>
MARRITZA: Labour camp? I've never been to Bajor. I was a military file
clerk. I now reside on Kora Two, where I boarded the freighter, which,
unfortunately for me, came here. Now, Commander, if you have no more
questions, I'd like to be on my way. <br>
KAINON: (in the next cell) Am I still drunk, or am I in jail with a
Cardassian? Odo! You're not keeping me in here with one of those! Odo!
Odo! <br>
MARRITZA: I put myself in your hands, Commander.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Commander's office]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Let me get this straight. You're saying that
Marritza does have Kalla-Nohra? <br>
BASHIR: There's no doubt about it. He has all the symptoms. And when I
ran a lower pulmonary bio-probe, it read positive. <br>
SISKO: And you're sure he doesn't have Pottrik Syndrome. <br>
BASHIR: Yes, absolutely. If he had Pottrik's, the bio-probe would've
been negative. <br>
SISKO: Then he was at the Gallitep labour camp. <br>
BASHIR: Definitely. I've cross-checked all Bajoran and Federation
medical records, and there's simply no other way he could've gotten
this condition. <br>
KIRA [OC]: Kira to Sisko. <br>
SISKO: Yes, Major. <br>
KIRA [OC]: Commander, there's an incoming transmission for you from
Bajor. It's the Minister of State. <br>
SISKO: Thank you. If you'll excuse me, Doctor. <br>
(Bashir leaves) <br>
SISKO: Minister Kaval. Good day, Sir. <br>
KAVAL [on monitor]: And to you, Commander. I trust you're in good
health. Things are going well on the station? <br>
SISKO: Quite well, thank you. <br>
KAVAL [on monitor]: That's wonderful. I'm told you've performed a
special service for Bajor today. Congratulations to you. <br>
SISKO: I don't quite follow. <br>
KAVAL [on monitor]: You're not holding a certain Cardassian for us? <br>
SISKO: We are holding a Cardassian, temporarily. <br>
KAVAL [on monitor]: By temporarily, you mean until you're satisfied
that a verified identification has been made. <br>
SISKO: Minister, I'm not sure we have the grounds to hold him that
long. <br>
KAVAL [on monitor]: I fully understand your concerns, Commander, but
since our Major Kira's accepted responsibility in this matter, the
burden is off your shoulders. <br>
SISKO: I don't agree. <br>
KAVAL [on monitor]: Commander, if this Marritza was at Gallitep, we
want him, and we will have him. Is that clear? <br>
SISKO: It is. <br>
KAVAL [on monitor]: Good. We'll chat again soon. Good day, Commander.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: May I join you? <br>
KIRA: Actually, I was just about to pay a visit to our friend Marritza.
<br>
SISKO: That's what I wanted to talk to you about, Major. I'd like Odo
to handle this investigation. <br>
KIRA: Why? <br>
SISKO: He's our Chief of Security. <br>
KIRA: Minister Kaval put me in charge. <br>
SISKO: Minister Kaval doesn't run this station. <br>
KIRA: And the Federation has no right telling us how to deal with our
criminals. <br>
SISKO: If it turns out that he is a criminal, then he'll be yours and
you're welcome to him. Until then, he's just a traveller under
suspicion. <br>
KIRA: You think this is all some personal vendetta on my part, don't
you? <br>
SISKO: I think you're too close to be objective, yes. <br>
KIRA: You're right, I'm not objective. But I'm your first officer, and
I give you my word I will conduct myself accordingly. You once said we
were friends. I'm asking you now as a friend, please, let me conduct
this investigation. I owe it to them. <br>
SISKO: You mean the victims. <br>
KIRA: That's right. The ones who moved too slowly and never moved
again. I'm asking for all the Bajorans who can't ask. Let a Bajoran do
this. <br>
SISKO: Sisko to Odo. <br>
ODO [OC]: Go ahead. <br>
SISKO: Constable, Major Kira will be in charge of the Marritza
investigation. <br>
ODO [OC]: I understand. <br>
KIRA: Thank you.

KAINON: I'll do my best. Oh, and Odo let me know when you hang the
Cardassian. <br>
(Kainon leaves) <br>
ODO: I've begun a background check on Marritza. So far he is what he
says he is. He boarded that Kobheerian freighter at Kora Two, where
he's worked as an instructor at a military academy for the past five
years. <br>
KIRA: Keep looking. <br>

Major, But this sem'hal stew could use a little yamok sauce. <br>
KIRA: I'm glad you're enjoying it. <br>
MARRITZA: I doubt that, Major. I doubt it very much. <br>
KIRA: I hope it won't disturb your dinner if I ask you a few questions.
<br>
MARRITZA: And if I refuse to answer? <br>
KIRA: I'll ask them anyway. <br>
MARRITZA: Of course. <br>
KIRA: This is my job. <br>
MARRITZA: Persecuting Cardassian goes far beyond your job, Major, it's
your passion. <br>
KIRA: You claim you were never at Gallitep. <br>
MARRITZA: I missed that honour. <br>
KIRA: And that your illness is not Kalla-Nohra. <br>
MARRITZA: Again, true. <br>
KIRA: Again false. Our doctor confirmed you do have Kalla-Nohra, which
means you were at Gallitep. If your lies are going to be this
transparent, it's going to be a very short interrogation. <br>
MARRITZA: In that case, I'll try to make my lies more opaque. <br>
KIRA: What was your rank at Gallitep? What were your duties? <br>
MARRITZA: You don't want to know. <br>
KIRA: Just answer the question. <br>
MARRITZA: You'll be disappointed. <br>
KIRA: I'll risk it. <br>
MARRITZA: I had the distinction of serving in the exalted position of
filing clerk. <br>
KIRA: Filing clerk? <br>
MARRITZA: I told you you'd be disappointed. Actually, I would have
preferred to avoid military service altogether, but I had the good
fortune to be posted to the records office at Gallitep, and I turned
out to be an exemplary file clerk. In fourteen units of service, I
never misplaced or lost a record. I received numerous commendations.
Gul Darhe'el himself called my computer filing system a masterpiece of
meticulous exactitude. Well, there you are. My secret's out. My crimes
laid bare. I await execution. <br>
KIRA: I hope we don't keep you waiting long. I never heard of a filing
clerk becoming an instructor at a military academy. <br>
MARRITZA: Until now. <br>
KIRA: And what did you teach? <br>
MARRITZA: Believe it or not, filing. <br>
KIRA: I can verify that. <br>
MARRITZA: Be my guest. <br>
KIRA: I still think you're a liar. <br>
MARRITZA: So much for our search for the truth. Now we trade insults. <br>
KIRA: You admit you worked under Gul Darhe'el. <br>
MARRITZA: We all did. <br>
KIRA: I take it then you witnessed the atrocities. <br>
MARRITZA: Atrocities? What atrocities? Oh, I do vaguely recall hearing
a scream from time to time. Atrocities? No. <br>
KIRA: You expect me to believe you knew nothing of the murders, the
tortures? You never saw the bodies? <br>
MARRITZA: Of course I saw bodies. People died all the time at Gallitep.
Mining accidents, illnesses, feuds among the workers. <br>
KIRA: You're saying Bajorans killed each other? <br>
MARRITZA: At times. Over food, a blanket, a woman. The conditions were
harsh. It was a labour camp, Major. <br>
KIRA: I helped liberate that camp. I saw the bodies. I know how they
died. <br>
MARRITZA: You saw what we wanted you to see. Who do you think started
the rumours about brutality at Gallitep? It was Gul Darhe'el himself.
Now there was a leader. Brilliant, extraordinary man. He knew that to
rule by fear was to rule completely. Why bother with actual mass
murders, when the mere reports of such incidents had the same effect. <br>
KIRA: Which was? <br>
MARRITZA: You know as well as I do, Major. To keep you Bajorans
thinking of yourselves as victims. To keep you afraid and helpless. <br>
KIRA: Turned out we weren't so helpless. We did get rid of you. <br>
MARRITZA: Leaving was a political decision, Major. I've enjoyed
reminiscing with you. Now I think it's time you let me out of here. <br>
KIRA: I can't do that. <br>
MARRITZA: Oh, no, no, no, no, of course not. No, you see you're the one
who's lying now, Major. it's not the truth you're interested in. All
you want is vengeance. </font></p>

the Federation guarantees the safe and unrestricted passage of all
travellers visiting your station. <br>
SISKO: That's correct. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Then how do you explain the detention of a
Cardassian citizen? <br>
SISKO: Marritza came here seeking medical attention. Right now, he's
under our doctor's care. All we're trying to do is to verify his
identity. A simple matter, if you'll give us some assistance. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: I assure you, Commander, you don't require our
assistance. If this patient says his name is Marritza, then that's who
he is. I hope you're not suggesting you don't trust him simply because
he's Cardassian. <br>
SISKO: I don't trust him because he's already lied about being at
Gallitep. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Is that what you're charging him with, Commander?
Lying? <br>
SISKO: So far, we haven't charged him with anything. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Then let him go. <br>
SISKO: I'd like nothing better. But first I need to know who it is I'm
letting go. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: I do appreciate the awkwardness of your position
here, Commander. This Bajoran obsession with alleged Cardassian
improprieties during the occupation is really quite distasteful. <br>
SISKO: I suppose if you're a Bajoran, so was the occupation. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: I might remind you that neither one of us is
Bajoran, and I would hate their bitterness to cause conflict between
Cardassia and the Federation. <br>
SISKO: I hope to avoid that too, with your help. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: You don't need my help to safeguard one Cardassian
on your own station. If any of these Bajoran hate-mongers get their
hands on him, I'll holding you personally responsible.

vengeance. <br>
DAX: Are you worried that maybe he's right? <br>
KIRA: All I want is to see him punished. <br>
<br>
DAX: Even if he is just a file clerk? <br>
KIRA: That's just it. I don't want him to be a file clerk. I want him
to be, I don't know, something worse. <br>
DAX: You want him to be guilty. <br>
KIRA: As far as I'm concerned, if he was at Gallitep, he is guilty.
They're all guilty. His punishment will let Bajor feel some
satisfaction. <br>
DAX: It sounds like you're trying too hard to believe what you're
saying. You already know if you punish him without reason, it won't
mean anything. And you already know vengeance isn't enough.

MARRITZA: I don't think I could pay for all of them, Major. There were
so many, and you can only execute me once. <br>
KIRA: That's my only regret. But I'll settle for knowing that Bajor
will finally have the satisfaction of punishing The Butcher of
Gallitep. <br>
MARRITZA: Tell me, Major, did you figure it all out by yourself, or did
you have help from your Federation masters? <br>
KIRA: I'll let you wonder about that. It'll keep you occupied while
we're waiting for the provisional government to prepare your war crimes
tribunal. <br>
MARRITZA: War crimes? How could there be war crimes when there hasn't
been a war? Oh, I can understand your wish there had been a war. Your
need to indulge some pathetic fantasy of brave Bajoran soldiers
marching to honourable defeat. But in fact, Major, you and I know there
was no war, no glory. Bajor didn't resist, it surrendered. <br>
KIRA: The Bajorans were a peaceful people before you came. We offered
no threat to you. We could never understand why you had to be so
brutal. <br>
MARRITZA: Well, we can't have that, Major, I want no more secrets
between us. Anything you don't understand, I'll explain to you. <br>
KIRA: Thank you, but I think I've heard enough of your lies. <br>
MARRITZA: What lies? You mean my failure to divulge my true identity?
Believe me, Major, I yearned to tell you but I knew how much more
satisfaction you would have if find out for yourself. And that was my
only deception. Marritza was a magnificent file clerk. And I, Gul
Darhe'el, I hope you'll not think it immodest of me to say so, but I
was a magnificent leader. You never saw Gallitep at its height. For a
labour camp, it was the very model of order and efficiency. And why?
For that, you have to look to the top. To me! My word, my every glance,
was law and the verdict was always the same, guilty. <br>
KIRA: You're insane. <br>
MARRITZA: Oh, no, no, Major. You can't dismiss me that easily. I did
what had to be done. My men understood that, and that's why they loved
me. I would order them to go out and kill Bajoran scum, and they'd do
it. They'd murder them and they'd come back covered in blood, but they
felt clean. Now why did they feel that way, Major? Because they were
clean. <br>
KIRA: You admit your atrocities. <br>
MARRITZA: I admit everything. Why not? I was the best at what I did. My
accomplishments speak for themselves. Can you say the same? You and
that little Shakaar resistance cell that you belonged to. All you did
was annoy Cardassians, while I was out exterminating Bajorans. <br>
KIRA: Make sure you tell that to the tribunal. <br>
MARRITZA: Oh, I will. <br>
KIRA: Then they'll sentence you to death. <br>
MARRITZA: Let them. Don't you see? It doesn't change anything. Kill me,
torture me, it doesn't matter. You've already lost, Major. You can
never undo what I've accomplished. The dead will still be dead. What
will you do now, Major? Withhold my medicine?

ODO: Here, this will help. <br>
KIRA: What is it? <br>
ODO: Maraltian seev-ale from Quark's private stock. Better? <br>
KIRA: You know, Odo, I wonder how many others like Darhe'el are still
out there, still free, unpunished. <br>
ODO: Quite a few, no doubt. But thanks to you, there's one less out
there now. <br>
KIRA: You should've heard him. He bragged about what happened at
Gallitep. The torture, the murders, the humiliation. He's proud of
about what he did to us. <br>
ODO: Why don't you go to your quarters, and lie down for a while. We'll
leave him alone with his Cardassian pride. <br>
KIRA: I don't want to lie down. That's what he'd like. Another Bajoran
hiding in a corner. He's probably in there laughing at me right now. <br>
ODO: He won't be laughing very long. <br>
KIRA: I hate him, Odo. I hate his smirking, superior Cardassian face.
When I was fighting with the resistance, we used to lie awake at night
plotting the assassination of men like Darhe'el. Now I have to stand
there and listen to him belittle the Shakaar and everything it stood
for. <br>
ODO: Perhaps you should avoid discussing your personal history with a
creature like that. <br>
KIRA: I didn't. <br>
ODO: Then how did he know you were with the Shakaar? <br>
KIRA: I don't know, he was an important military leader. <br>
ODO: That doesn't explain it. If he'd been in charge of quelling
Bajoran resistance, then he might have had your name on file. But he
commanded a forced labour camp. Something's not right here. Where are
you going? <br>
KIRA: To have another little chat with Gul Darhe'el. <br>
(Kira leaves) <br>
ODO: Computer. Review all off-station requests for information

so fascinating? <br>
KIRA: How did you know I was with the Shakaar? <br>
MARRITZA: This provisional government of yours certainly moves slowly.
They should've dragged me away in chains by now. <br>
KIRA: Just answer the question. <br>
MARRITZA: My, my, you are a strutting little egotist. You forget the
brilliance of Marritza's filing system. He made sure that I was
provided with information on all your little terrorist bands. What I
particularly enjoyed were the termination reports. Yes, life in a
forced labour camp can be so isolating. At times I felt that I alone
bore the burden of cleansing Bajor of its rabble, but those reports
reassured me I was not alone. <br>
KIRA: And I'm supposed to believe you remembered my name from some
report you read years ago? <br>
MARRITZA: At the risk of bruising your vanity even further, Major, I
didn't remember you at all until I heard your name here. I can see that
disturbs you. <br>
KIRA: Hardly. <br>
MARRITZA: You know, Major, they will be coming for me soon, so before
we say goodbye, there are a few little questions I should like to ask
you. <br>

BASHIR: Of course. <br>
ODO: Three months ago, a request came from Kora Two for information
concerning Kira Nerys. <br>
BASHIR: To what purpose? <br>
ODO: I'm not sure, but the name on the request was Aamin Marritza. I've
established a subspace link with Kora Two and I'd like you to access
his medical history there. <br>
DAX [OC]: Dax to Odo. Gul Dukat is responding to your subspace
transmission. <br>
ODO: Could you route it to my office. <br>
DAX [OC]: Aye, sir.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DUKAT [on monitor]: I do miss working with you,
Odo. I've miss our games of kalevian montar. <br>
ODO: As I recall, Gul Dukat, we played one game and you cheated. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: The same old Odo. Like a blunt instrument. But no
to your question I regret that I cannot give you access to any of the
files pertaining to Gul Darhe'el, but I assure you the files would only
tell you what I'm telling you. Gul Darhe'el is dead. <br>
ODO: That's not possible. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: I attended his funeral myself. As a matter of fact,
he's buried under one of the largest military monuments on Cardassia. <br>
ODO: Then who are we holding here? <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Some innocent Cardassian citizen, just as I
explained to your Commander Sisko. And we want him released. <br>
ODO: That innocent citizen has admitted he is Gul Darhe'el. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: What are you saying? <br>
ODO: He says his name is Gul Darhe'el. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Then he's lying! <br>
ODO: Well if he is, it's the most foolish lie he could have invented.
It's likely to get him executed. Why would anyone do such a thing? <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: I don't know. But I tell you I attended Darhe'el's
funeral. <br>
ODO: You're sure the man you saw buried was Gul Darhe'el? <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Half of Cardassia viewed his body, <br>
ODO: I saw a photograph of Darhe'el taken at the Gallitep labour camp.
It certainly appears to be the man we're holding. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: You're mistaken. <br>
ODO: Am I? <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: This is obviously some plot to embarrass the
Cardassian Empire. <br>
ODO: It's possible. Give me access to your files and perhaps I can find
some proof to support your claim that Gul Darhe'el is dead. <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: I suppose I could grant you limited access to the

heard of some who were even younger than that. <br>
MARRITZA: Yes, yes, let's get to the real issue. How many Cardassians
did you kill? I mean personally. <br>
KIRA: I didn't keep count. <br>
MARRITZA: Oh, I think you did. And I'm sure your total wasn't limited
to military personnel. After all, the most effective terrorist weapon
was random violence. Don't leave now, Major, it's just getting good.
How many Cardassian civilians did you kill? <br>
KIRA: Look, I regret a lot of what I had to do. <br>
MARRITZA: How convenient of you. <br>
KIRA: We had no choice! We were fighting for survival! <br>
MARRITZA: So were we! We had an empire to protect. We needed your
resources. Everything I did was for the greater glory of Cardassia! And
if you spineless scum had to be ground under, so much the better. All
that mattered was Cardassia. I loved my homeland. That's what justified
my actions, that's what gave me my strength. <br>

to me by Gul Dukat. <br>
SISKO: According to this, Gul Darhe'el died in his sleep six years ago.
Cause of death, massive coleibric haemorrhage. <br>
KIRA: Commander, I guarantee you that's a forged document. I think it's
pretty clear what's going on here. The Cardassians are trying trick us
into letting him go. <br>
SISKO: I wouldn't put it past our friend Gul Dukat. <br>
ODO: Nor would I. However <br>
KIRA: The man in there confessed he is Gul Darhe'el. <br>
ODO: Major, the man in there has Kalla-Nohra Syndrome. <br>
KIRA: Of course he does. <br>
ODO: According to the evidence I've been sent, Gul Darhe'el never
contracted that condition. <br>
KIRA: More evidence from our trustworthy Gul Dukat. <br>
SISKO: What've you got, Constable? <br>
ODO: Darhe'el's progress reports from Gallitep show that when the
mining accident occurred, he was back on Cardassia being awarded the
Proficient Service Medallion. <br>
SISKO: If he wasn't at Gallitep on the day of the accident, then he
couldn't have contracted Kalla-Nohra. <br>
ODO: Correct. But the man we're holding does have it. <br>
KIRA: I can't believe I'm listening to this. <br>
ODO: I'm afraid there's more, Major. I inquired about his last two
weeks on Kora Two. He resigned his position at the military academy,
put all his affairs in order, and even provided handsomely for his
housekeeper, I understand <br>
KIRA: All right, all right. So like any criminals, he wanted to move on
before somebody traced his whereabouts. <br>
ODO: He specifically requested passage on a vessel that was scheduled
to stop here, at a Bajoran station. A rather unusual request for a
Cardassian war criminal. <br>
SISKO: Unless he wanted to be captured. <br>
KIRA: Wait a minute. Let's be clear about one thing. This evidence may
raise some interesting questions. Nevertheless, Darhe'el is going to be
sent back to Bajor to stand trial for the atrocities he committed. <br>
SISKO: Major, that is still to be determined. <br>
KIRA: Then go talk to him. If you still have any doubts, just listen to
what he has to say. He was there. He did it. He'll tell you about it. <br>
(Bashir enters) <br>
BASHIR: Constable, I've checked on Marritza's medical record. <br>
SISKO: What have we got? <br>
BASHIR: He's been under treatment for Kalla-Nohra Syndrome, of course,
and a few other minor ailments, most relating to his age. It's all
pretty standard, actually, except for one thing. <br>
ODO: Which is? <br>
BASHIR: Five years ago, after arriving on Kora Two, he started taking
massive doses of a dermatiraelian plastiscine, which is a dermal
regenerative agent used to maintain skin resilience after cosmetic
alteration. <br>
KIRA: You're saying he changed his face to look like Gul Darhe'el. <br>
BASHIR: It certainly appears that way.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: How are you feeling? <br>
MARRITZA: I was starting to get a little bored, but seeing you again
brightens my day. <br>
KIRA: I was referring to your Kalla-Nohra Syndrome. Would you like see
Doctor Bashir? <br>
MARRITZA: Oh, so that's it. You want to see me writhe around on the
floor in pain. A Cardassian would never put on such a deplorable
display in front of a Bajoran. You just don't understand us at all. <br>
KIRA: I'm beginning to understand a great deal about you. One thing
does puzzle me. <br>
MARRITZA: And what would that be? <br>
KIRA: How you contracted Kalla-Nohra syndrome. <br>
MARRITZA: Did you think that the mining accident only affected the
Bajoran labourers, and not their Cardassian masters? That would be very
nice. <br>
KIRA: So you're saying you were at Gallitep when that mining accident
occurred? <br>
MARRITZA: Of course. Why are we going over this again? <br>
KIRA: Because your own progress reports shows that you were back on
Cardassia at the time of the accident. <br>

KIRA: Receiving your Proficient Service Medallion. <br>
MARRITZA: The reports are wrong. <br>

KIRA: Then let me help you. Five years ago when you first got to Kora
Two <br>
MARRITZA: All right, that's enough. Your presence no longer amuses me.
Get out. <br>
KIRA: Why did you have your face altered? <br>
MARRITZA: Security, get this woman out of here! <br>
KIRA: Why are you pretending to be Gul Darhe'el? <br>
MARRITZA: Why don't you ask me something intelligent, as for instance
how I did I feel when we were withdrawing from Bajor? The answer is, I
was furious! The thought of leaving any survivors behind was repulsive
to me. So while our useless office clerks were packing their precious
files, I ordered my overseers to begin slaughtering the labourers. <br>
KIRA: If you felt that way about your filing clerks, why did you take
Marritza's name? <br>
MARRITZA: My plan was to do nothing less than kill every Bajoran in the
camp! And to this day, my one regret is that I was not able to
accomplish this honourable goal. <br>
KIRA: You're Marritza, aren't you? <br>
MARRITZA: You mistake me for that bug? That whimpering nothing? Oh, you
stupid Bajoran girl, don't you know who I am? I'm your nemesis, I'm
your nightmare. I'm the Butcher of Gallitep. <br>
KIRA: The Butcher of Gallitep died six years ago. You're Aamin
Marritza, his filing clerk. <br>
MARRITZA: That's not true. I am alive. I'll always be alive. It's
Marritza who's dead. Marritza, who was only good for cowering under his
bunk and weeping like a woman. Who, every night, covered his ears
because he couldn't bear to hear the screaming for mercy of the
Bajorans. <br>
(He breaks down in tears) <br>
MARRITZA: I covered my ears every night. I couldn't bear to hear those
horrible screams. You have no idea what it's like to be a coward, to
see these horrors and do nothing. Marritza's dead. He deserves to be
dead. <br>
(Kira releases the cell forcefield) <br>
MARRITZA: What are you doing? <br>
KIRA: I'm letting you go. <br>
MARRITZA: Security? Get in here! <br>
KIRA: You didn't commit those crimes, and you couldn't stop them. You
were only one man. <br>
MARRITZA: No, don't you see? I have to be punished. We all have to be
punished. Major, you have to go out and tell them I'm Gul Darhe'el.
It's the only way. <br>
KIRA: Why are you doing this? <br>
MARRITZA: For Cardassia. Cardassia will only survive if it stands in
front of Bajor and admits the truth. My trial will force Cardassia to
acknowledge its guilt. And we're guilty, all of us. My death is
necessary. <br>
KIRA: What you're asking for is another murder. Enough good people have
already died. I won't help kill another.
