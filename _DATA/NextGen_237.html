<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JELLICO: Gul Lemec, I assure you that what the
Federation wants above all, is the preservation of peace. <br>
LEMEC: Then how do you explain the fact that a Federation team launched
an unprovoked assault on Cardassian territory less than fourteen hours
ago? <br>
JELLICO: I don't know what you're talking about. <br>
LEMEC: Then let me explain. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Lieutenant Worf,
and Doctor Beverly Crusher landed on Celtris Three, attacked one of our
outposts in a brutal assault, and killed over fifty five men, women and
children. <br>
JELLICO: What evidence do you have of that? <br>
LEMEC: We have all the evidence we need. We have Captain Picard. <br>
RIKER: Is he alive? <br>
LEMEC: The Cardassian Union has yet to decided how it will respond to
this latest provocation. But rest assured, we will respond. <br>
(the Cardassians leave) <br>
RIKER: Is there any truth in what he's saying? <br>
JELLICO: Captain Picard and the others were sent to investigate reports
of a metagenic weapon on Celtris Three. It's possible that they may
have been captured. But if they did escape, they'll head for the Lyshan
system. The Enterprise is supposed to meet them there in eight hours.
Will, I want you to take a shuttlecraft and head for the rendezvous
point. The Enterprise will have to remain here until the endgame with
Gul Lemec is played out. <br>

MADRED: Captain Picard. <br>
PICARD: I demand to see a neutral representative as required by the
Federation-Cardassian peace treaty. <br>
(Madred removes the blindfold and the guards leave) <br>
MADRED: We have already sent a message to Tohvun Three, the nearest
neutral planet. They assure us they will dispatch someone immediately.
Will you allow me to remove your restraints? (Picard holds up his
hands.) I understand that you are a student of archaeology. Did you
know that Cardassia boasts some of the most ancient and splendid ruins
in the entire galaxy? <br>
PICARD: I know that the burial vaults of the First Hebitian
civilisation are said to be magnificent. <br>
MADRED: Apparently when they were first unearthed two hundred years
ago, they were. The burial vaults contained unimaginably beautiful
artefacts made of jevonite, a rare, breathtaking stone. But most of
those objects are gone. <br>
PICARD: What happened to them? <br>
MADRED: What happens to impoverished societies. The tombs were
plundered, priceless treasures stolen, a few were preserved in museums
but even those were eventually sold in order to pay for our war
efforts. <br>
PICARD: That war cost you hundreds of thousands of lives. It depleted
your food supplies, left your population weakened and miserable and yet
you risk another war. <br>
MADRED: Let's not waste time arguing about issues we can't resolve.
Would you care to tour the Hebitian burial vaults? <br>
PICARD: What I would like is to be returned to my ship. <br>
MADRED: My dear Captain, you are a criminal. You have been apprehended
invading one of our secret facilities. The least
that will happen is for you to stand trial and be punished. But I am
offering you the opportunity for that experience to be civilised. <br>
PICARD: What is the price of that opportunity? <br>
MADRED: Cooperation. We need to know the Federation's defence strategy
for Minos Korva. <br>
PICARD: You've injected me with drugs. Surely you must realise that
I've already answered truthfully every question you've put to me. <br>
MADRED: Captain, we have gone to great lengths to lure you here because
we know that in the event of an invasion, the Enterprise will be the
command ship for the sector encompassing Minos Korva. <br>
PICARD: Then it seems you have more knowledge of the situation than I. <br>
(two guards come in and take hold of Picard. He struggles.) <br>
MADRED: Wasted energy, Captain. You might come to wish you hadn't
expended it in such a futile effort. <br>
PICARD: Torture is expressly forbidden by the terms of the Seldonis
Four convention governing treatment of prisoners of war. <br>
(a metal piece is lowered from the ceiling, and Madred takes a knife
from his desk) <br>
MADRED: Are you in good health? Do you have any physical ailments I
should know about? (the knife) Beautiful, isn't it? The stone is
jevonite. And now you know why it is so highly prized. From this point
on, you will enjoy no privilege of rank, no privileges of person. From
now on, I will refer to you only as human. You have no other identity. <br>
(Madred cuts Picard's clothes off and leaves them around his ankles.
Naked, his hands are manacled and attacked to the metal piece above his
head. Then the piece is raised so Picard is hanging just above the
floor. In other words, a form of crucifixion.) <br>

JELLICO: I know you were close to him, Will, but we don't even know if
he's still alive. Under the circumstances, a rescue mission would be
foolhardy. <br>
RIKER: Shouldn't we assume that he is alive until it's been proved
otherwise? We cannot just abandon him. <br>

MADRED: Thirsty? I would imagine so. Well, It's time to move on. <br>
PICARD: I've told you all that I know. <br>
MADRED: Yes, I'm sure you have. (he turns on four spotlights behind his

PICARD: I see four lights. <br>
MADRED: No, there are five. Are you quite sure? <br>
PICARD: There are four lights. <br>
MADRED: Perhaps you're aware of the incision on your chest. While you
were under the influence of our drugs, you were implanted with a small
device. It's a remarkable invention. By entering commands in this PADD,
I can produce pain in any part of your body at various levels of
severity. Forgive me. I don't enjoy this but I must demonstrate. It
will make everything clearer. <br>
(Picard falls to his knees in agony) <br>
MADRED: Surprising, isn't it? Most people feel at first that they can
steel themselves against it but they're completely unprepared for the
intensity of the pain. That was the lowest possible setting. <br>
PICARD: I know nothing about Minos Korva. <br>
MADRED: But I've told you that I believe you. I didn't ask you about
Minos Korva. I asked how many lights you see. <br>

LEMEC: The Selonis Convention applies to prisoners of war, which means
you would have to acknowledge that he was captured during a mission
authorised by the Federation. Are you willing to make such an
admission? <br>
JELLICO: No. <br>
LEMEC: Then he will be treated as a terrorist. <br>
JELLICO: It's not my concern. <br>
LEMEC: There is, of course, an alternative. <br>
JELLICO: I'm listening. <br>
LEMEC: If the Federation agreed to a complete and immediate withdrawal
from this sector, then we would be disposed to release Captain Picard
and forget about this incident. <br>
JELLICO: I'll have to discuss this with my superiors. <br>
LEMEC: Of course. You have seven hours. <br>
(the Cardassians leave) <br>
TROI: What are you going to do? <br>
JELLICO: Send a message to Admiral Necheyev. I recommend that she
reject Lemec's proposal and deploy additional starships along the
border. <br>
RIKER: What about Captain Picard? <br>
(Jellico shakes his head) <br>
RIKER: I'm not suggesting you trade an entire star system for one man's
life, but you've got to acknowledge that these were Federation orders
and he is a prisoner of war. <br>
JELLICO: No. <br>
RIKER: He will have the protection of the Seldonis Convention. <br>
JELLICO: That would play right into Gul Lemec's hand. He's just waiting
for some sign of weakness on our part before he starts making more
demands. <br>

life as a negotiating tactic. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Data is now wearing command red and three pips) <br>
JELLICO: They went to a lot of trouble to lure a Federation team to
that planet. Why? <br>
DATA: It is possible that the Cardassians were specifically interested
in capturing Captain Picard. <br>
LAFORGE: Why do you say that? <br>
DATA: The metagenic weapon they were supposedly developing used a
theta-band subspace delivery system. Captain Picard is one of only
three Starfleet Captains with extensive experience in theta-band
devices. The other two are no longer in Starfleet. <br>
JELLICO: So they tailored a fake weapon to lure Picard. But why? They
must've known we'd change all his access codes and security protocols. <br>
LAFORGE: Maybe they were interested in something that he did in the
past. Something that happened while he was Captain of the Enterprise. <br>
JELLICO: Or something he was going to do in the future. In case of a
Cardassian attack, the Enterprise will be assigned as Command ship for
this sector. If the Cardassians got wind of that <br>
LAFORGE: They might have assumed Captain Picard would know those
defence plans. <br>
DATA: If your theory is correct, the Cardassians may be planning an
attack somewhere in this sector. <br>
JELLICO: The question is, where? Geordi, I want you to conduct a
discreet scan of Gul Lemec's ship. Look for anything unusual, anything
that might indicate where they've been lately. <br>

Orra. Now that she's separated from her mother, she depends on you. <br>
JIL ORRA: I will, father. Do humans have mothers and fathers? <br>

the way they're able to sneak into your heart. I must admit, I was
completely unprepared for the power she had over me from the moment she
was born. <br>
PICARD: I'm surprised that you let her come in here. <br>
MADRED: Why? <br>
PICARD: To expose a child to this. To someone who is suffering. To see
that it is you that inflict that suffering. <br>
MADRED: From the time Jil Orra could crawl she's been taught about the
enemies of the Cardassians, and that enemies deserve their fate. <br>
PICARD: When children learn to devalue others, they can devalue anyone,
including their parents. <br>
MADRED: What a blind, narrow view you have. What an arrogant man you
are. What do you know of Cardassian history? <br>
PICARD: I know that once you were a peaceful people with a rich
spiritual life. <br>
MADRED: And what did peace and spirituality get us? People starved by
the millions. Bodies went unburied. Disease was rampant. Suffering was
unimaginable. <br>
PICARD: Since the military took over hundreds of thousands more have
died. <br>
MADRED: But we are feeding the people. We acquired territory during the
wars. We developed new resources. We initiated a rebuilding programme.
We have mandated agricultural programmes. That is what the military has
done for Cardassia. And because of that, my daughter will never worry
about going hungry. <br>

LAFORGE: It looks like they had some minor hull degradation along their
warp nacelles. The distribution pattern indicates a recent exposure to
a molecular dispersion field. <br>
JELLICO: Where could they have run into a dispersion field? <br>
LAFORGE: The McAllister C Five nebula's just across the border. It's
approximately seven light years from Federation space. <br>
JELLICO: Could there be Cardassian ships inside the McAllister nebula? <br>
LAFORGE: It's possible, but they wouldn't be able to stay in there for
very long. The particle flux in the nebula would begin to break down a
ship's hull just after seventy two hours. <br>
JELLICO: Is there a Federation system near the McAllister nebula that
might interest the Cardassians? <br>
LAFORGE: Minos Korva is only eleven light years from the nebula, and
the Cardassians tried to annex it during the war. <br>

at the sight of live taspar. I remember the first time I ate a live
taspar. I was six years old and living on the streets of Lakat. There
was a band of children, four, five, six years old, some even smaller,
desperately trying to survive. We were thin, scrawny little animals,
constantly hungry, always cold. We slept together in doorways, like
packs of wild gettles, for warmth. Once, I found a nest. Taspars had
mated and built a nest in the eave of a burnt-out building and I found
three eggs in it. It was like finding treasure. I cracked one open on
the spot and ate it, very much as you just did. I planned to save the
other two. They would keep me alive for another week. But of
course, an older boy saw them and wanted them, and he got them. But he
had to break my arm to do it. <br>
PICARD: Must be rewarding to you to repay others for all those years of
misery. <br>
MADRED: What do you mean? <br>

information. It is ultimately self-defeating as a means of control. One
wonders that it's still practiced. <br>

RIKER: Not at all. <br>
JELLICO: Musician. <br>
RIKER: Yes. <br>
JELLICO: Classical? Contemporary? <br>
RIKER: Jazz. <br>
JELLICO: Ah. <br>
RIKER: Is there something I can do for you, Captain? <br>
JELLICO: Are you aware of our plans to attack the Cardassian invasion
fleet? <br>
RIKER: Yes, sir. I understand you've been talking to every shuttle
pilot on board. <br>
JELLICO: Let's drop the ranks for a moment. I don't like you. I think
you're insubordinate, arrogant. wilful, and I don't think you're a
particularly good first officer. But you are also the best pilot on the
ship. <br>
RIKER: Well, now that the ranks are dropped, Captain, I don't like you,
either. You are arrogant and closed-minded. You need to control
everything and everyone. You don't provide an atmosphere of trust, and
you don't inspire these people to go out of their way for you. You've
get everybody wound up so tight there's no joy in anything. I don't
think you're a particularly good Captain. <br>
JELLICO: I won't order you to fly this mission. I'm here to ask. <br>
RIKER: Then ask me. <br>
JELLICO: Will you pilot the shuttle, Commander? <br>
RIKER: Yes. <br>
(Jellico starts to leave) <br>
RIKER: You're welcome.

LAFORGE: The proximity detector is working. We should be able to read

ships has a mine on its belly, my finger's on the button, and you're in
a very bad position. <br>

eject its primary phaser coil before setting course for the nearest
Cardassian base. <br>

control pad. He starts to smash it against the desk as Madred enters.) <br>
MADRED: That won't help. I have many more. <br>
PICARD: Still, it felt good. <br>
MADRED: Enjoy your good feelings while you can. There may not be many
more of them. I've just received word. There's been a battle. The
Enterprise is burning in space. The invasion of Minos Korva has been
successful. <br>
PICARD: I don't believe you. <br>
MADRED: There's no need for any further information from you. Our
troops were successful in spite of your refusal to help me. You might
have saved yourself a great deal of torment by yielding at the
beginning. <br>
PICARD: I want to see neutral representative. <br>
MADRED: There is no such person. The word will be that you perished
with your crew. No one will ever know that you are here with us, as you
will be for a long, long time. You do, however, have a choice. You can
live out your life in misery, held here, subject to my whims, or you
can live in comfort with good food and warm clothing, women as you
desire them, allowed to pursue your studies of philosophy and history.
I would enjoy debating with you. You have a keen mind. It's up to you.
A life of ease, of reflection and intellectual challenge, or this. <br>
PICARD: What must I do? <br>
MADRED: Nothing, really. Tell me how many lights you see. How many? How
many lights? This is your last chance. The guards are coming. Don't be
a stubborn fool. How many? <br>

LEMEC: You told me he would be ready to go. <br>
MADRED: We had some unfinished business. <br>

care of you. <br>

four. <br>

Anything at all. But more than that, I believed that I could see five
