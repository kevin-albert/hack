Captain's log, stardate 46461.3. We have arrived at a communication
relay station near the Klingon border, where we are scheduled to
deliver supplies. However, the station has not responded to repeated
hails. </font>

CRUSHER: What's that noise? <br>
LAFORGE: They must've left an audio monitoring system on. We're hearing
a few thousand subspace messages. I'll try and shut it off. Got it. <br>
(peace descends, revealing a banging sound) <br>
RIKER: Geordi, what's that? <br>
LAFORGE: I don't know. Sounds like a loose panel or something. I think
it's coming from this service duct over here. <br>
(he pulls a piece of equipment away from the wall to reveal) <br>
RIKER: Here's your loose panel. <br>
(the sound is of a wagging tail hitting the metal. woof!) <br>
LAFORGE: Hey, pooch. hey, pooch, come on out of there. Come on. Come
on. Hey, pooch, what are you doing in there?<br>
WORF: Commander, the shuttlecraft is gone. There is no one on board. <br>
CRUSHER: Commander? <br>
RIKER: What is it? <br>
CRUSHER: Cellular residue. I believe these are the remains of one of
our lieutenants. <br>
(Worf is cutting the deck plate out with his phaser) <br>
CRUSHER: All of the blood traces I found match those of Lieutenant
Aquiel Uhnari. I'll assume those are her remains but I'll need to take
the
deck plate back to Sickbay just to be sure. <br>
RIKER: It would take a powerful weapon to do that. <br>
CRUSHER: I'll have a better idea once I've analysed the deck plate. <br>
RIKER: If that is Uhnari, where's Rocha? <br>
CRUSHER: The station's shuttle's gone. Maybe he took it. <br>
RIKER: Before Uhnari died or after? <br>
WORF: We're ready, Commander. <br>
RIKER: Did you have any luck downloading the station logs? <br>
LAFORGE: Not yet. I can't get past these security lock-outs, and I
think I know why. All encrypted subspace messages are sent through this
channel. Take a look at this signal notation. <br>
RIKER: It's out of sequence. <br>
LAFORGE: Looks like somebody tried to by pass the access protocols and
break into the coded messages. It caused the security lockouts to
freeze right up. <br>
RIKER: Are there any messages missing? <br>
LAFORGE: I won't know until I get into the files. <br>
RIKER: Looks like you've made a friend. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah. <br>
RIKER: We're going to back to the ship. Let me know as soon as you have
something. <br>
LAFORGE: I'm going to try accessing the logs from another console. <br>

interface. <br>
(woof! The dog is on a bed. There is a display stand with a few items
on it) <br>
LAFORGE: What is it, pup? What's the matter? Something over here? (a
curved gold thing with blue stones) This doesn't look like it belongs
to you. Ah, This what you want, huh? (a bone-shaped chew) There you go.
Computer, run station logs in sequence. <br>
AQUIEL [OC]: Station log, stardate 46458.3. Today we configured the
relay controller grid. It was the last primary system we had to
overhaul. We are scheduled to recalibrate and align the antennae
systems in the next three days. <br>
LAFORGE: Computer, access visual output. <br>
AQUIEL [OC]: Sent in my third request for a message delay buffer. Until
it arrives, Lieutenant Rocha and I have rigged a memory module to
compensate. It better work, or about a half million subspace messages
are going to end up drifting through space. Computer, open Uhnari
correspondence file. <br>
LAFORGE: Computer, access correspondence files, Lieutenant Aquiel
Uhnari. <br>
AQUIEL [OC]: Hello, Shiana. Sorry I haven't talked to you in a while
but I've been dealing with the new Lieutenant, Rocha. So far he's been
rude, arrogant and condescending, and he's only been here two days.
This might be a long year. <br>
LAFORGE: Come on, Lieutenant. Stick with me. <br>
AQUIEL [OC]: I had the dream again. Mother's calling out my name. She's
somewhere in the house. I get to the top of the hill all right, but
then the house is slanted. I'm still walking uphill. I can't find her.
Doors everywhere and they all look the same.

with to metal of the deck plate. We're trying to micro-vaporise the
metal in order to get a clear DNA sample. <br>
PICARD: Do you have any idea what killed her? <br>
CRUSHER: Well this is just a guess, but from the molecular deposition
on the plating I'd say it was a high-level phaser blast. <br>
RIKER: Could it have been a Klingon disruptor? <br>
CRUSHER: Possibly. <br>
RIKER: Geordi's found evidence that the encrypted messages have been
tampered with, and we are close to Klingon space. <br>
PICARD: There hasn't been a Klingon raid against the Federation for
more than seven years. We can't risk a diplomatic incident until we
have more evidence. <br>
CRUSHER: And there's still the question of what happened to Lieutenant
Rocha. <br>
PICARD: Get Rocha's personnel file from Starfleet Command, and ask
Starbase two twelve to help us find that shuttle. <br>
RIKER: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Keep me apprised, Doctor.

LAFORGE: All right, let's try this again. Come on, this should be
working. The phase inducters are aligned. Come on, Lieutenant, I know
you're in here somewhere. Computer me run a subsystem diagnostic, with
a frequency range of ten to one hundred megahertz. <br>
COMPUTER: Diagnostic cycle will be complete in twenty seconds. <br>
LAFORGE: Iced coffee? <br>
(the replicator produces his drink and the dog barks) <br>
LAFORGE: What is it, girl? <br>
(he's finally got an image - of a young dark-skinned alien woman) <br>
AQUIEL [on monitor]: Hello, Shiana. By the time you get this the
Batarael will be over. This is the first time I haven't been there.
I've been wondering, who's singing the Horath in my place. (sings)
Jomiael hahnalia ma marou nitalia. Rumael tavariel fatra di va Jomiael.
(next letter) I had that dream again. The one where Mother is
screaming. I climb the hill to our house but I can't get to her.
Shiana, this time I ran away. I was so scared I ran back down the hill.
I think I know why I've been having the dreams about danger. It's
because of what's been happening with that Klingon. He's getting more
aggressive all the time. Not just the usual threat. <br>
(Geordi rewinds the message) <br>
AQUIEL [on monitor]: It's because of what's been happening with that
Klingon. He's getting more aggressive all the time. Not just the usual
threat. Morag actually locked his disruptors to the station this time.
I don't think there'll be any trouble. It just brings up those feelings
of panic, of wanting to run, wanting to get away from danger. Shiana, I
couldn't say this to anyone but you, but the panic? It's the same thing
I used to feel whenever Father got angry, when I knew he was going to
punish me. Only now, I'm out here in space, and there's no place to
run.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: There are three references to a Commander
Morag, a Klingon officer who patrols this section of the border.
Apparently he would pass the station every few days and harass them. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps this Morag was the one who was interested in obtaining
the encrypted messages. <br>
LAFORGE: Could be. She didn't say. But I do have several more days of
logs left to watch. I'm hoping to learn more. <br>
PICARD: Very well. In the meantime, I'll speak with the Klingon
Governor about Commander Morag.

your outpost? <br>
PICARD: I'm merely saying that I'm following up on evidence that my
officers discovered on board. <br>
TORAK [on viewscreen]: Evidence. So you are making an accusation. The
Klingon Empire will not stand for these kinds of lies. <br>
PICARD: Governor Torak, I apologise. I can see that you honestly didn't
know what happened aboard the station. I will just have to take this
matter up with Gowron. I'm really sorry that we bothered you. <br>
TORAK [on viewscreen]: Gowron won't bother with such a minor incident. <br>
PICARD: Well, ordinarily he wouldn't, but of course I was his Arbiter
of Succession. I'm sure that he will be happy to come here and
investigate this matter. You needn't worry about it any longer. <br>
TORAK [on viewscreen]: Gowron will come here? <br>
PICARD: Oh, yes. So once again, thank you for your help. Oh, I will be
sure to mention your name to Gowron when I speak to him. <br>
TORAK [on viewscreen]: I will investigate this further, Picard. You
need not bother Gowron with this matter. <br>

AQUIEL [on monitor]: Shiana, you always said I'd look great with a wig,
so here it is. What do you think? <br>
LAFORGE: Definitely not you. <br>
AQUIEL [on monitor]: (taking the huge construction off) Okay, maybe I'm
getting a little crazy. You would too, if you were stuck on a relay
station in the middle of nowhere with no one for company except an
egomaniac like Keith Rocha. I took a big risk today. I countermanded an
order he gave. I agreed to handle the comm. traffic for Relay Station
one nine four while they shut down for maintenance. Rocha said we
couldn't handle the additional signal load, but I think he's wrong.
When he finds out he'll be furious. It's days like this I wish I was
home. You know what I miss most? Muskan seed punch. Real Muskan seed
punch. You can get it from the replicator, but it's not the same. I'd
give anything for some of the punch Mother used to make with chunks of
the seeds still in it. (noises off) Keith, is that you? Keith?

LAFORGE: How could she read this stuff? <br>
RIKER: How's it going? <br>
LAFORGE: I've managed to access all of Lieutenant Uhnari's logs. I'm
still looking for Lieutenant Rocha's. Whatever happened to the
encrypted messages had a cascade effect on the whole storage system. I
can't find his files anywhere. I'm running a level three diagnostic
now. <br>
RIKER: Maybe Rocha didn't make the official logs. Uhnari could have
been responsible for them. <br>
LAFORGE: I don't think so. Aquiel was the junior officer here. <br>
RIKER: Aquiel? <br>
LAFORGE: Lieutenant Uhnari. I've been up all night watching her
personal logs. I guess I'm starting to feel like I know her. <br>
RIKER: What was she like? <br>
LAFORGE: Well she was Hahliian. She had one sister named Shiana, she
drank muskan seed punch. She had a quirky sense of humour. She liked to
sing. She had questionable taste in literature. <br>

not kill the woman. Now I will prove it to you. ghoS! <br>
(a Klingon escorts a woman into the room) <br>
TORAK: This is Lieutenant Aquiel Uhnari. <br>
(soon after) <br>
AQUIEL: We were running a level two diagnostic of the message buffer,
Nothing special. Rocha had been on edge all morning, but he'd been
irritable ever since he got there, so I didn't think anything of it. We
were halfway through the procedure when suddenly he attacked me. He
grabbed me, threw me against a bulkhead. I yelled at him to stop but he
wouldn't listen. He took me by the throat. I broke free and tried to
get to the weapons locker. I'm not sure what happened next but somehow
I got aboard the shuttle and left. <br>
TORAK: We found her on our side of the border heading toward Sector two
five two zero. She is lucky my patrol ship did not destroy her vessel
on sight. <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant, why didn't you contact Starfleet? Let them know
what happened on board the station? <br>
AQUIEL: I don't know, sir. Maybe I passed out. I'm not even sure how
long I was in the shuttle before the Klingons picked me up. <br>
LAFORGE: Forty six hours. You've been gone forty six hours. <br>
CRUSHER: We presumed you were dead. Your blood stains were found at the
murder scene. <br>
AQUIEL: I must have cut my head when he pushed me against the bulkhead.
<br>
WORF: Then the remains we found must be those of Lieutenant Rocha. <br>
CRUSHER: I can't confirm that. Until we're able to separate the
cellular residue from the
deck plate, I won't be able to do a clear DNA scan. <br>
RIKER: You said you were trying to get to the weapons locker. Is there
a possibility
that you did? <br>
AQUIEL: No, I didn't. <br>
RIKER: You're sure? <br>
AQUIEL: I don't remember exactly what happened to me after I was
attacked. I'm sorry. It's as if all my memories were drained out of me.
<br>
LAFORGE: Your logs said that a Commander Morag had been harassing you.
Did you let him or any other Klingon aboard the station? <br>
AQUIEL: Absolutely not. <br>
WORF: If that is true, then Morag or some other Klingon must have
boarded the station after she left. We found traces of Klingon DNA on
the station. <br>
TORAK: You still try to blame us. <br>
WORF: Have the courage to admit your mistakes. Or are you a lo'Be Vos? <br>
TORAK: At least I do not wear the uniform of the P'tak! <br>
PICARD: Governor, we are merely exploring all the possibilities.
Lieutenant Uhnari's logs reported that Commander Morag had been
harassing the station. <br>
TORAK: He was doing his job. <br>
PICARD: If he was only doing his job, then I'm sure you won't mind if
we spoke with him. <br>
TORAK: Very well. In the interests of diplomacy, I will allow you to
speak to Morag. But my patience has limits. <br>
