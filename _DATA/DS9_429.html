Personal log, stardate 47329.4. I finally realise why I've had trouble
sleeping the last few nights. Yesterday was the fourth anniversary of
the massacre at Wolf three five nine. The fourth anniversary of
Jennifer's death.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO [OC]: I'm not sure what bothers me more. The
date itself, or the fact that it almost passed unnoticed. <br>
(Sisko is staring at a 3D chess set) <br>
JAKE: Dad what are you doing up? <br>
SISKO: I was about to ask you the same thing. <br>
JAKE: I had a weird dream. <br>
SISKO: Get some hot chocolate and tell me about it. <br>
JAKE: Nah, it's nothing. <br>
SISKO: Come on. Tell me about this weird dream. <br>
JAKE: It's stupid. <br>
SISKO: Maybe so, but the thing about dreams is, if you talk about them,
they kind of go away faster. <br>
JAKE: Okay, but don't laugh. <br>
SISKO: I promise. <br>
JAKE: I don't know. I was on the station somewhere. I'm not sure where.
And I was trying to get back here but I couldn't find my way. Every
time I saw a familiar corridor, it kind of led into some other
direction. See, I told you it was stupid. <br>
SISKO: You got me interested. <br>
JAKE: Well then, I guess I got a little scared and started looking for
you, but I couldn't find you. Somehow I ended up in Ops but you weren't
in your office. And then it was like the floor started sloping and I
couldn't keep my balance and all I wanted to do was find you. <br>
SISKO: And here I am. <br>
JAKE: Dad, I love you. <br>
SISKO: I love you too. <br>
JAKE: I have a calculus test in the morning. <br>
SISKO: Then you'd better get some sleep. <br>
JAKE: Yeah. Dad? I miss her. <br>
SISKO: Me too.

woman in red behind him.) <br>
FENNA: Beautiful, aren't they? I don't think I've seen the stars shine
so brightly. <br>
SISKO: The Bajorans call that constellation the Runners. I can never
figure out if they're running toward something or away from something. <br>
FENNA: Does that matter? Sometimes it just feels good to run. <br>
SISKO: I never thought about it that way. I'm Benjamin Sisko, Commander
of this station. <br>
FENNA: I'm Fenna. I'm sorry. You must be very busy. I didn't mean to
bother you. <br>
SISKO: You're not bothering me at all. <br>
FENNA: Good. <br>
(They walk) <br>
FENNA: Commander of the station. That must be very exciting. All those
ships coming and going. Every day must bring something new. <br>
SISKO: It has its moments. In some ways, though, I prefer this time the
best, when everything's quiet and <br>
FENNA: And you can feel a kind of anticipation in the air like
something wonderful's going to happen but you don't know what it is. I
guess that sounds kind of silly, doesn't it? <br>
SISKO: Not at all. That's one of the great things about this station.
You never know what's going to happen next, or who you're going to
meet. <br>
FENNA: I like it here. I wish I could stay longer. <br>
SISKO: Where are you going? <br>
FENNA: I'm not really sure. I guess I'll just keep going, like the
Runners. <br>
SISKO: I tell you what. Before you run any farther, why don't I show
you around the station? If you have the time. <br>

SISKO: Good morning, Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: Morning, Commander. <br>
SISKO: Is this maintenance or repair? <br>
O'BRIEN: Right now it's maintenance, but five'll get you ten it'll be a
repair by the time I'm through. <br>
SISKO: Admit it, Chief. If you were on a station where everything
worked, you'd be miserable. <br>
O'BRIEN: You may be right, sir. (sparks) But I'd be willing to give it
a try. <br>
SISKO: Good morning, Major. Computer, one chiraltan tea, with a double
twist of lemon. Something wrong? <br>
KIRA: No, nothing. <br>
SISKO: If something's bothering you, Major, I want to hear it. <br>
KIRA: It's just that every morning for the last year, I've seen you
walk in here and start your day with a raktajino. <br>
SISKO: I love raktajino. <br>
KIRA: I know. You never even talk to anyone until you've had your first
cup. <br>
SISKO: I'm not awake until I've had my first cup. <br>
KIRA: So how come you're drinking chiraltan tea? <br>
SISKO: I, er, I just felt like having something different. That is all
right with you, isn't it, Major? <br>
KIRA: Of course. You can drink whatever you like. <br>
SISKO: Thank you, Major. I appreciate your support. <br>
DAX [OC]: Dax to Sisko. <br>
SISKO: Go ahead, Lieutenant. <br>
DAX [OC]: Professor Seyetik and I are in the science lab, if you'd like
to meet him. <br>
SISKO: On my way. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Lieutenant, where's our guest? <br>
DAX: Inside the flux generator. <br>
SISKO: What? What's he doing in there? He could be killed. <br>
DAX: Well, that's what I tried to tell him. <br>
SISKO: And he went in anyway. <br>
DAX: Benjamin, have you ever met a terraformer? <br>
SISKO: No. What's that got to do with it? <br>
DAX: You can't tell a terraformer anything. It's an amazing talent
bringing dead worlds to life, but humility and common sense aren't part
of the job description. <br>
SISKO: Oh. <br>
(A big man comes out of the strobing light of the generator in a
protective suit) <br>
SEYETIK: There you go, Lieutenant. That should increase your generator
output by at least five percent. You must be Commander Sisko. Gideon
Seyetik. Great pleasure to meet you, sir. <br>
(He's got grey hair and a beard, and a big smile) <br>
SISKO: Professor. I'm a great admirer of your work. <br>
SEYETIK: Good. A man of intelligence and taste. I can see we're going
to get along famously. <br>
SISKO: My son and I visited Blue Horizon on the way to Deep Space Nine.
I must say I was impressed. <br>
SEYETIK: Of course you were. I created the place and even I'm
impressed. How did you like Da Vinci Falls? <br>
SISKO: We didn't get to see them. We were only on the surface for a few
hours. <br>
SEYETIK: Oh, Commander, you missed Blue Horizon's crowning glory.
Imagine water cascading off cliffs the height of Mount Everest,
thundering through continuous rainbows, straight into an ocean the
colour of sapphire wine. I'm going to have to take you there one day.
By God, I wouldn't mind seeing it again myself. <br>
SISKO: I may take you up on that. <br>
SEYETIK: Good, good. But first, Epsilon one nineteen. <br>
SISKO: Yes, I understand the initial surveys look promising. <br>
SEYETIK: Promising? They look magnificent. Imagine, reigniting a dead
sun. Bringing new life to an entire solar system. Next to that,
terraforming planets will seem like child's play. <br>
DAX: Let's hope it works. Right now, it's a promising theory. <br>
SEYETIK: Of course it'll work. I never fail. Well, I did once, but I
found it didn't agree with me. So I swore never to do it again and I
never break my word. You should be glad you're coming with me,
Lieutenant. This'll be my crowning achievement. Giving birth to a star.
Even I will have a hard time topping that one. </font></p>

piece of Andorian tuber root go to waste, are you? <br>
SISKO: Why do you ask? <br>
DAX: Because it's delicious. May I? <br>
SISKO: Be my guest. <br>
DAX: I'm going to need the extra calories to keep up with Seyetik. The
man works almost as much as he talks. Benjamin? <br>
SISKO: What? <br>
DAX: Are you looking for someone? <br>
SISKO: I'm sorry, what were you saying? <br>
DAX: Nothing important. I have to meet with Chief O'Brien. We're
boosting the maximum speed of Seyetik's ship to warp nine point five.
If his experiment fails and that sun goes supernova, we're going to
need to get out of there fast. <br>
SISKO: I'll see you in Ops. </font></p>

SISKO: I was just thinking about you. <br>
FENNA: Were you really? I've been thinking about you, too. <br>
SISKO: Where did you disappear to last night? <br>
FENNA: I had to go. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to rush away like that.
Does your invitation still stand? To show me around the station? <br>
SISKO: What would you like to see? <br>
FENNA: Everything. <br>
SISKO: Everything? That's going to take some time. <br>

FENNA: You must come here all the time. <br>
SISKO: Not really. But when I do, a ship is usually blocking the view. <br>
FENNA: We should have brought a picnic basket. <br>
SISKO: Here? <br>
FENNA: What better place? <br>
SISKO: Well, I guess there is tomorrow. <br>
FENNA: Is that an invitation? <br>
SISKO: Sounded like one to me. <br>
FENNA: Then I accept. <br>
SISKO: Good. There's plenty left to see. In fact, I doubt that we can
see it all in one evening. <br>
FENNA: Then you can show me the rest after our picnic tomorrow. <br>
SISKO: Do you always do that? <br>
FENNA: Do what? <br>
SISKO: Say exactly the right thing. <br>
FENNA: No one's ever told me that before. <br>
SISKO: There you go again. So, tell me all about yourself. <br>

food? Those are worms. And Altrina vomited all over the table. It was
pretty disgusting. <br>
SISKO: That's nice, Jake. <br>
JAKE: Nice? She threw up. <br>
SISKO: Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I was thinking about something else.
<br>
JAKE: Dad, are you in love? <br>
SISKO: What? <br>
JAKE: You know, with a woman. You're showing all three of the signs. <br>
SISKO: Signs? <br>
JAKE: The ones that Nog told me about. Loss of appetite, daydreaming,
smiling all the time. <br>
SISKO: You've been talking to Nog about women again? <br>
JAKE: Look, I just want you to know that if you're in love, it's all
right with me. <br>

JAKE: What's she like? <br>
SISKO: She's really interesting. <br>
JAKE: Interesting, huh? So when do I get to meet her? <br>
SISKO: I think it might be a little early to do that. <br>
JAKE: Why? She likes you too, doesn't she? <br>

ODO: Above all, stay alert. If the subspace transmission I received is
correct and Villus Thed is en route to the station, I want to be
notified the moment he arrives. Keep him under constant surveillance,
but remember, he's a short-range telepath, so stay at least five metres
away from him at all times. That's all. <br>

skin, dark hair. And the last time I saw her, she was wearing, she was

DAX: Come on, Benjamin. I saw you with her last night on the Promenade.
What's her name? <br>
SISKO: Fenna. But believe me, Dax, there is nothing to talk about. <br>
DAX: You used to tell Curzon everything. <br>
SISKO: Not everything. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Seyetik's quarters]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SEYETIK: A great terraformer needs the green thumb
of a gardener, the eye of a painter and the soul of a poet. And of
course it doesn't hurt to be a raging egomaniac. <br>
KIRA: Which makes you eminently qualified. <br>
SEYETIK: Of course. <br>
BASHIR: Terraforming is amazing enough, but I don't understand how you
intend to re-ignite a dead sun. <br>
SEYETIK: Basically I'll use a remote-piloted shuttlepod to deliver
proto-matter into the dead star. This will cause a cascade effect which
will transform the star's carbon and oxygen into elemental hydrogen.
Then we just stand back and watch the fireworks. <br>
DAX: Of course, if it doesn't work it might be the last thing we ever
see. <br>
SEYETIK: Come now, Lieutenant. Nothing of worth was ever created by a
pessimist. <br>
SISKO: I don't know about that. Van Gogh, Beckett, Y'Raka. I wouldn't
exactly call them optimists. <br>
SEYETIK: Precisely, and look at their work. Dark and dreary and dismal.
Art should be an affirmation of life. For example, take my own work in
the field. <br>
BASHIR: I once saw an exhibit of your paintings at the Central Gallery
on Ligobis Ten. They were certainly memorable. I don't think I've ever
seen such huge canvasses. <br>
SEYETIK: Doctor, nobody ever accused me of understatement. <br>
DAX: Certainly not anyone who's ever read your autobiography. <br>
SEYETIK: Nine volumes and counting. You know, I always said I wanted to
write as many books as I've had marriages. Which reminds me, wait till
you taste the food my wife has created for you. None of that replicated
nonsense you're used to. No, every dish was prepared entirely by
Nidell's own sweet hands. <br>
KIRA: I can't wait to meet her. <br>
SEYETIK: And so you shall. She should be just about ready. I'll go and
get her. <br>
(Seyetik leaves) <br>
KIRA: Commander, you think he'd notice if we weren't here when he got
back. <br>
SISKO: Don't even think about it, Major. I've had dinner with about two
dozen Bajoran ministers. I think you owe me this one. Besides, Seyetik
is one of the Federation's greatest minds. <br>
KIRA: I know. He told me. <br>
BASHIR: I for one find him remarkable entertaining. <br>
(Seyetik enters) <br>
SEYETIK: Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to meet my wife and my
inspiration. Nidell. <br>
(Fenna's identical twin) <br>
DAX: Now we have something to talk about. <br>
(After dinner) <br>
BASHIR: I can't eat another bite. <br>
O'BRIEN: That was delicious. Do you think I could have the recipe? <br>
NIDELL: You'll have to ask Gideon. It's his creation. <br>
SEYETIK: Well, it took me years to perfect it. The secret, you see, is
to sear the kalo roots slightly before layering them over the slices of
roasted waroon. <br>
SISKO: She acts like she doesn't recognise me. <br>
SEYETIK: (under the dialogue) The most important thing is the broth.
One litre of clear Rumall stock. A tumbler and a half of Gremish, two
clusters of Vulcan redspice. <br>
DAX: It is the same woman, isn't it? <br>
SISKO: She looks the same. <br>
SEYETIK: Half a dozen humat pods, and a dash of ice salt. Then you
reduce it in a Andorian boiler, cook it exactly five hundred degrees
Kelvin and then just pepper to taste. Any questions? <br>
O'BRIEN: Maybe you should write that down. <br>
SEYETIK: Of course. No trouble at all. Now, I think we should continue
this conversation in the other room. We shall be more comfortable
there. <br>
(Everyone leaves except Sisko and Nidell. She starts clearing the
plates.) <br>
NIDELL: Commander, can I help you with something? <br>
SISKO: I hope so. It would have been a lot easier if you'd told me you
were married. <br>
NIDELL: I don't understand. <br>
SISKO: Yesterday, on the Promenade. You had plenty of opportunity. <br>
NIDELL: Commander, I don't know what you're talking about. I've never
met you before tonight. <br>
SISKO: I suppose you never told me that your name was Fenna? Would you
like to talk about this? <br>

found the woman I was looking for. <br>
ODO: Did you? And where was she, if you don't mind my asking? <br>
SISKO: Aboard the Prometheus. <br>
ODO: The Prometheus? Are you sure? <br>
SISKO: Yes, we just left there a few minutes ago. <br>
ODO: That's impossible. <br>
SISKO: What do you mean? <br>

drive on the Prometheus purring like a kitten. It'll do nine point six
in a pinch but I wouldn't take it any faster. <br>
DAX: I thought the theoretical maximum for those engines was warp nine
point five? <br>
O'BRIEN: It was. <br>
SEYETIK: Must I remind you, Lieutenant, some of us only have one
lifetime. <br>
DAX: I'll be right there. <br>
O'BRIEN: Good luck, Lieutenant. Commander. <br>
(O'Brien leaves as Sisko arrives) <br>
DAX: Come to see us off, Benjamin? <br>
SISKO: Not exactly. I'm going with you. After all, how often do you get
to see a star reborn. <br>
DAX: Do you really think this is a good idea? <br>
SISKO: I need answers, Dax, and the key to Fenna's disappearance could
be on that ship.

PIERSALL: Have you finished loading the protomatter device into the
shuttlepod? <br>
DAX: All set. The containment fields are holding fine, remote guidance
systems are fully operational. <br>
(Sisko and Seyetik enter) <br>
SEYETIK: I'm telling you, Commander, by the time I was through with New
Halana, it was a veritable paradise. How are we doing, Mister Piersall?
<br>
PIERSALL: We'll be initiating preliminary scans in a few hours. <br>
SEYETIK: Let me know when we get there. <br>
SISKO: Well, Professor, you must be eager to get started. What did you
call this? Your crowning achievement. <br>
SEYETIK: Don't remind me. Commander, my entire life has been a series
of escalating triumphs. It's what I live for, knowing that no matter
what I achieve, there's always another triumph waiting for me. <br>
SISKO: And now? <br>
SEYETIK: Are you familiar with the Klingon poet G'trok? <br>
SISKO: A little. The Fall of Kang is required reading at the Academy. <br>
SEYETIK: So honour the valiant who die 'neath your sword. <br>
SISKO: But pity the warrior who slays all his foes. <br>
SEYETIK: Yes, well, a bit obvious perhaps, but true nonetheless. So,
what were we talking about? <br>
SISKO: You. <br>
SEYETIK: Of course. My favourite subject. Where was I? <br>
SISKO: You had just finished terraforming New Halana. <br>
SEYETIK: Ah, of course. Well, you can imagine how grateful the Halanans
were. Endless parades and receptions. Got to be a bit of a bore
actually. But then I met Nidell. She was the daughter of a local
dignitary. She was utterly infatuated with me from the very start. I
can't say I blame her, actually. The first time she saw me, I was
surrounded by crowds of people, unveiling a statue they'd commissioned
in my honour. I could tell from the start she was something special.
You know, she'd never been
off world before she met me. I promised to show her the galaxy. I'd
have given it to her if I could've. <br>
SISKO: She must love you very much. <br>
SEYETIK: She does, Commander. Don't ask me why, but she does.

SEYETIK: Help her. She won't wake up. <br>
DAX: She's in shock. Her respiration is shallow, her heartbeat
irregular and falling. Her blood pressure's dropping. Benjamin, she's
dying. <br>
SEYETIK: You've got to do something! <br>
DAX: I don't know that I can. <br>
SEYETIK: Fenna. I should have known. But you can't be here. Nidell
promised me you'd never come back. <br>
FENNA: I don't know what you're talking about. <br>
SEYETIK: Just look at her. <br>
FENNA: She looks like me. <br>
SEYETIK: Of course she looks like you. She is you. The real you. <br>
SISKO: Professor, what the hell is going on here? <br>
SEYETIK: That thing over there isn't real. She's an illusion, created
by my wife's unconscious mind. <br>
FENNA: That's not true! Benjamin, you know that he's lying. <br>
SEYETIK: Nidell is a psychoprojective telepath. Fenna's just another
one of her projections. <br>
SISKO: Lieutenant? <br>
DAX: I've never seen readings like these. Her occipital lobe is giving
off enormous amounts of energy. I don't see how she can survive more
than an hour or two like this. <br>
SEYETIK: She's dying. You've got to something. <br>
DAX: There's nothing I can do. <br>
SISKO: Get Fenna to my quarters, Dax, and notify Doctor. <br>
SEYETIK: No! <br>
SISKO: Get her out of here, Dax. <br>
FENNA: Benjamin, I want to stay with you <br>
SISKO: It'll be all right, Fenna. I just want to talk to Professor
Seyetik here. <br>
(Fenna and Dax leave) <br>
SISKO: All right, Professor, if what you're saying is true, Nidell's
psychoprojective abilities are killing her and I need to know why. <br>
SEYETIK: Nidell doesn't even know this is happening. In times of deep
emotional distress Halanans sometimes lose control of these abilities.
My wife is very emotionally distraught. This happened once before,
three years ago on Terosa Prime. It nearly killed her then. She swore
to me it'd never happen again. <br>
SISKO: Obviously it has. <br>
SEYETIK: You may have noticed, Commander, that I tend to invoke strong
emotions from people, particularly my wives. Oh, they all start out
loving me, but a few years of togetherness soon cures them of that. My
others all had the good sense to leave me. <br>
SISKO: Why can't Nidell? What keeps her with you. <br>
SEYETIK: Halanans mate for life. She can never leave me, no matter how
much she might want to.

woman before. I don't know why he's saying those things about me but
they're lies. I'm as real as you are. <br>
SISKO: Oh, how I want to believe that. But can you tell me where you
came from? How you got to the station? Can you tell me a single memory
of your life before we met on the Promenade? <br>
FENNA: Benjamin, I'm so frightened. <br>
SISKO: Nidell's dying, Fenna. She only has a few hours. <br>
FENNA: What happens to me if she dies? <br>
SISKO: You no longer exist without her. But you can save her, give her
back the life she gave to you. <br>
FENNA: I don't know how. <br>
SISKO: You can go back to her. I've seen you do it three times. <br>
FENNA: But even if she lives, then I die, and everything you and I have
dies with me. <br>
SISKO: Fenna, what we have is a dream. I wouldn't trade it for
anything, but it's still just a dream. Nidell's dream. <br>
FENNA: And she won't remember any of it, will she? <br>
SISKO: There's no way to be sure. <br>
FENNA: I love you, Benjamin, and I always will. <br>
(Their passionate embrace is interrupted) <br>
DAX [OC]: Commander, you'd better come to the Bridge right away. <br>
SISKO: What is it? <br>

to go to all this trouble without an audience. <br>
PIERSALL: Professor, you'll be killed. What do you think you're doing? <br>
SEYETIK [on viewscreen]: Making history. You might want to record this
for posterity and all that. <br>
DAX: He's about sixty seconds from impact. <br>

SISKO: Gideon, you don't have to do this. We've found a way to save
Nidell. <br>
SEYETIK [on viewscreen]: I had a feeling you would, Commander. This is
the only way I can really set her free. I owe her that.
Besides, this'll be my crowning achievement. Remember The Fall of Kang.
Well, this is one warrior who refuses to be pitied. <br>
PIERSALL: What's he talking about? <br>
SISKO: Klingon poetry. <br>
DAX: Thirty seconds from impact. <br>
SISKO: Gideon, I want you to turn the shuttlepod around now. That's an

gravity well of the star. <br>
SISKO: Engage the tractor beam. <br>
PIERSALL: He disabled it before he left. <br>
SEYETIK [on viewscreen]: Commander, when this is over, you'll find a
case among my personal belongings. There's something in there you need
to find. <br>
SISKO: What is it? <br>
(The signal is starting to break up) <br>
SEYETIK [on viewscreen]: My obituary. I wrote it myself. After all, I
couldn't leave such an important document to some stranger.
Do me a favour and see to it that it's sent to the Daystrom Institute
for publication. Which reminds me, I didn't get a chance to update it
before I left. Let the record state, 'He sacrificed himself on the
altar of science.' <br>
DAX: Ten seconds. <br>
SISKO: I'll be sure they get it. <br>
SEYETIK [on viewscreen]: I'm sure I can count on you. <br>
DAX: Five seconds. <br>

You'll never see anything like this again. Let there be light! <br>
