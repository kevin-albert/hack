Captain's personal log, stardate 51247.5. It's been a week since our
return to Deep Space Nine, but the mood of celebration continues. We're
still at war, and the station's been designated Headquarters for the
Ninth Fleet. That, plus our strategic position guarding the wormhole,
makes DS Nine one of the most tempting targets in the entire quadrant.
But for now at least, the war seems very far away.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Sisko has just been watching the busy Promenade
from the upper level. Morn kissed a woman, and a crewwoman smiled up at
Sisko.) <br>
SISKO: Morning. Good morning. Morning, Major. <br>
KIRA: Good morning, Captain. <br>
SISKO: Do you know how much I missed hearing you say that. <br>
KIRA: Do you know how much I hated saying, Good morning, Dukat. <br>
SISKO: I can imagine. What's on the agenda? <br>
KIRA: USS Potemkin has completed her repairs and is rejoining the fleet
later today. Exeter, Sutherland and Akagi have submitted resupply
requests, and there are about a thousand messages from Starfleet
Command awaiting your eyes only attention. <br>
SISKO: Anything else? <br>
KIRA: General Martok is waiting in your office. <br>
SISKO: Ah. I'll start with the General. <br>
KIRA: Thought you would. <br>
SISKO: Have I mentioned that it's good to be home? <br>
KIRA: Once or twice.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARTOK: You knew about this, didn't you? <br>
SISKO: I had a pretty good idea. <br>
MARTOK: And you did nothing to stop it? <br>
SISKO: No. In fact, I recommended you for the position myself. Allow me
to offer my congratulations to the new Supreme Commander of the Ninth
Fleet. <br>
MARTOK: Do you have any idea how much paperwork a Supreme Commander has
to do? <br>
SISKO: You're welcome. May I arrange quarters for you on the station? <br>
MARTOK: No, I'll keep my flag aboard the Rotarran. It may be cramped,
but at least I'll feel like I'm still in the war. By the way, I'd like
Worf to continue functioning as my principal Intelligence Officer. <br>
SISKO: I don't see any problem with that. He's the only officer I know
who can never get enough work. <br>
MARTOK: At least if he's busy he'll stop going on about this wedding of
his. There were times aboard the Rotarran he nearly drove me mad. Until
his son arrived, it was all he could talk about. Then Alexander became
all he could talk about. The man is nothing if not
single-minded. <br>
SISKO: I haven't met Worf's son yet. What's he like? <br>
MARTOK: He's a fine boy. Dedicated, eager. He has the heart of his
father, but he's not the best soldier I've ever seen.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALEXANDER: But when he ordered me to bring the
system back online I thought he was still talking about the hydrostatic
system, so <br>
DAX: You didn't engage the pumps while the check valves were open? <br>
WORF: He did. <br>
ALEXANDER: I flooded the entire deck with superheated hydraulic fluid.
It took me three days to clean it up, but I swear it still smells like
burnt dog hair in there. <br>
DAX: Remind me to keep you away from the Defiant. You're a menace. <br>
ALEXANDER: The Rotarran's crew actually thinks of me as a good luck
charm. You know, the more mistakes I make, the safer they feel. I hope
the Ya'Vang's crew feels the same way. <br>
WORF: The Ya'Vang? <br>
ALEXANDER: I got new orders this morning. The battle cruiser Ya'Vang
took heavy losses in their last engagement so most of the Rotarran's
crew are being transferred there at the end of the week, including me.
More bloodwine? <br>
DAX: Why not? <br>
WORF: No, not for me. <br>
(Alexander leaves the table with Dax's mug.) <br>
QUARK: Handsome young man. He must get his looks from his mother's
side. <br>
WORF: What do you want? <br>
QUARK: Have you had a chance to reconsider my offer? <br>
WORF: We are not getting married in this bar. The ceremony will take
place on the Klingon homeworld after the war. <br>
DAX: Worf, let's do it here. This week, before Alexander leaves. <br>
QUARK: Perfect. I'll handle all the arrangements. <br>
WORF: Wait. I thought we had agreed. <br>
DAX: We did, but I would hate for Alexander to miss his father's
wedding. It would mean so much to him, and besides, it may be a long
time before you see him again. <br>
(Alexander returns with the drinks.) <br>
ALEXANDER: What's going on? <br>
WORF: Our wedding plans have changed. We are getting married here on
Deep Space Nine. And I want you to be my Tawi'Yan. <br>
DAX: Sword-bearer. It's sort of like a best man. <br>
ALEXANDER: Me? Really? Oh, that's great! <br>
(He throws out his arms and hits a waiter's tray which crashes onto a
table.) <br>
QUARK: I'll put that on your tab.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Turbolift]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAX: it doesn't leave much time to make all the
arrangements, but fortunately there isn't that much left to do. Worf's
been planning the ceremony for the last three months. He has everything
figured out, right down to the colour of my shoes. <br>
KIRA: No offence, Jadzia, but it seems like this wedding is all about
what Worf wants. Habitat ring, section fifty one gamma. What about you?
<br>
DAX: A traditional Klingon wedding with all the trimmings is something
Worf's been thinking about since he was a boy. It probably has
something to do with being raised by human parents. In any case, when
it comes to Klingon tradition, Worf is very sentimental. <br>
KIRA: Worf? <br>
DAX: All men are sentimental. They just cover it up with scowls and
clenched jaws. There are times when Worf literally gets misty-eyed
talking about Klingon rituals.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: So that's why you're letting him make the
plans for the wedding? <br>
DAX: Mostly, but the truth is, I've gone through five Trill ceremonies
three as a bride, two as a groom, and I'm a little bored with it. <br>
(Odo swerves down a side corridor.) <br>
DAX: Is it my imagination, or did Odo just try and avoid us? <br>
KIRA: I didn't notice. We've been avoiding each other ever since the
Dominion left the station. I think we're both afraid of talking about
what happened during the occupation. <br>
DAX: What do you mean? <br>
KIRA: To tell you the truth, it's nothing I want to talk about right
now either. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Smaller than the wardroom, with just a table,
chairs and big wall screen.) <br>
WORF: Thank you for coming. As you probably know by now, Jadzia and I
will be married here on the station in six days. <br>
BASHIR: There's nothing more romantic than a wedding on DS Nine in
springtime. <br>
O'BRIEN: When the neutrinos are in bloom. <br>
WORF: By tradition, the Klingon man spends the four nights before his
wedding on a mental and spiritual journey. It is called Kal'Hyah, the
path of clarity. And he is accompanied by his closest male friends. <br>
MARTOK: You cannot imagine the experience that awaits us. Four long
nights filled with song and fellowship. A time of unbridled pleasures. <br>
O'BRIEN: Are we talking about a bachelor party? <br>
WORF: It is a similar ritual. <br>
BASHIR: That's good enough for me. <br>
O'BRIEN: Me too. <br>
SISKO: Count me in. <br>
WORF: We will meet in the holosuite tomorrow night at twenty one
hundred hours. <br>
MARTOK: I advise you all to get plenty of rest. <br>
BASHIR: Four nights at a Klingon bachelor party. Just think of the
possibilities. <br>
O'BRIEN: Thank God Keiko's not here. <br>
(O'Brien and Bashir leave.) <br>
SISKO: I wonder what Dax will be doing while we're travelling down
Kal'Hyah? <br>
MARTOK: She will be taking a different journey with my wife. <br>
SISKO: Your wife?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARTOK: By marrying Worf, Dax will be joining the
House of Martok. Since the Mistress of a Great House must approve all
marriages, Sirella will spend the next four days evaluating Jadzia. <br>
(The airlock opens and a stately Klingon woman comes out.) <br>
MARTOK: My Lady. <br>
SIRELLA: You've put on weight and your hair is going grey. <br>
MARTOK: My deterioration is proceeding apace. <br>
SIRELLA: I thought you would be in your grave by now. <br>
MARTOK: I shall endeavour to die this year, if possible. Allow me to
present Captain Benjamin Sisko, Commander of Deep Space Nine. Captain,
may I present the Mistress of the House of Martok, my wife and the
mother of my children, Sirella, daughter of Linkasa. <br>
SISKO: Welcome to Deep Space Nine. <br>
SIRELLA: Thank you, Captain. Where is she? <br>
MARTOK: Jadzia's quarters are in the Habitat ring, section twenty five
alpha. Shall I escort you? It's quite far away. <br>
SIRELLA: I'll find my way. If you'll excuse me. <br>
(Yup, they're deeply in love. I'm thinking Benedick and Beatrice from <a href="http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/muchscenes.html" target="_blank"> Much Ado About
Nothing</a>.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: Are these real var'Hama candles? <br>
DAX: Yes, Worf. I travelled to Kronos, I captured three targs in the
Hamar Mountains, made the ritual sacrifice at dawn, came back to the
station, asked Quark to boil their shoulders into tallow. Then I spent
two days molding them into candles with my own hands. <br>
WORF: I was just asking. <br>
DAX: You were criticising. Again. Relax. She's not going to reject a
prospective daughter because the var'Hama candles in her welcoming
display were replicated. <br>
(Doorbell) <br>
DAX: Come in. <br>
(Sirella enters.) <br>
DAX: Tuq son bosh mok A'Beh Sirella koh. E'Gagh vet moh. <br>
SIRELLA: What is he doing here? <br>
WORF: I meant no disrespect. <br>
SIRELLA: Then leave.
(Worf leaves.) <br>
SIRELLA: Your worthiness to join our House will now be judged according
to the traditions of my family. <br>
DAX: I am prepared, my lady. <br>
SIRELLA: I doubt that. A Klingon woman would find it difficult to gain
my favour. For an alien, it will most likely be impossible. <br>
DAX: I like a challenge. <br>
SIRELLA: I will not have my authority challenged by you. <br>
DAX: That's not what I meant. <br>
SIRELLA: If you cannot say what you mean, say nothing at all. The
evaluation will begin tomorrow morning. Have the traditional meal
prepared before I arrive. And in the future, if you cannot trouble
yourself to make real var'Hama candles, try not to use such obvious
fakes.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: You never told me that your wife was opposed
to this marriage. <br>
MARTOK: Sirella is a woman of strong convictions. She believes that by
bringing aliens into our families we risk losing our identity as
Klingons. <br>
WORF: That is a prejudiced, xenophobic view. <br>
MARTOK: We are Klingons, Worf. We don't embrace other cultures, we
conquer them. If someone wishes to join us, they must honour our
traditions and prove themselves worthy of wearing the crest of a great
House. <br>
WORF: Jadzia is worthy. <br>
MARTOK: Of course she is. She is an honourable woman and a formidable
warrior. <br>
WORF: You should say that to Sirella. <br>
MARTOK: That's not such a good idea. I don't want her to think that I'm
interfering in her domain. <br>
WORF: Perhaps I should speak with her. Coming from me, it would not
seem like a challenge to her authority. <br>
MARTOK: I wouldn't do that if I were you. <br>
WORF: Why? <br>
MARTOK: Well, the truth is, she doesn't like you that much either. <br>
WORF: Me. <br>
MARTOK: Don't let that bother you I had every right to bring you into
the family and she's accepted the fact that there's nothing she can do
about it. <br>
WORF: How comforting. <br>
MARTOK: And they say that you have no sense of humour.

O'BRIEN: Well, it can't be all fun and games. I'm sure there has to be
some sort of ritual we have to go through before the party begins.
There is going to be a party, isn't there? <br>
ALEXANDER: You're asking me? I can barely say my name in Klingon. <br>
MARTOK: Prepare yourselves, my friends, for a journey you won't soon
forget. <br>
WORF: These are Ma'Stakas. <br>
(Worf hands out staves with big balls on the end.) <br>
BASHIR: What do we do with them? <br>
MARTOK: At the conclusion of the wedding ceremony, you will use them to
attack Worf and Dax. <br>
O'BRIEN: Obviously. Don't you know anything? <br>
WORF: The tradition dates back to the wedding of Kahless and Lukara,
who were nearly killed by Molor's troops moments after they were
married. Until the ceremony, you should keep them with you at all
times. <br>
SISKO: I trust that this combat is non-lethal? <br>
MARTOK: It is a symbolic attack only. <br>
(Alexander has found the buffet table.) <br>
WORF: The food is not to be eaten. <br>
ALEXANDER: Then what is it for? <br>
WORF: It is here to tempt us into breaking our fast. <br>
SISKO: Fast? <br>
WORF: There are six trials we must face on the path to Kal'Hyah. This
is the first, deprivation. We now begin a fast that will continue until
the day of the wedding. <br>
BASHIR: That's four days away. <br>
MARTOK: It is a short time, I know, but we must make the best of it. <br>
SISKO: What are the other five trials? <br>
WORF: Blood, pain, sacrifice, anguish and death. <br>

is poor and the placement of the braziers on their pedestals is sloppy.

SIRELLA: A Klingon woman would not complain. <br>
DAX: You wouldn't make a Klingon woman do it three times in a row. <br>
SIRELLA: I wouldn't have to. She'd have done it correctly the first
time. End this now, Jadzia. Go back to your own people. They will
tolerate your weaknesses and your failings in a way that a Klingon
family never will. In our House, you would always be an alien, an
outsider. At best, you'd be an object of pity. But you'd never be
accepted, never an equal, because you can never truly be one of us. <br>

DAX: But the second Dynasty ended when General K'Trelan assassinated
Emperor Reclaw. For the next ten years, the Empire was ruled by a
Council elected by the people. Modern-day Klingon historians refer to
this as The Dark Time, but it's interesting to note that this first and
only experiment in Klingon democracy actually produced several reforms
that <br>
SIRELLA: You are straying from the saga. <br>
DAX: Am I? <br>
SIRELLA: Your task is to recite the complete chronicle of the women in
my family. <br>
DAX: I just thought I'd provide you with a broader historical
perspective along the way. <br>
SIRELLA: I am familiar with Klingon history. Now, return to the story
of my twenty third maternal grandmother, Shenara, daughter of Emperor
Reclaw in the Second Dynasty. <br>
DAX: Well, that's where we run into a little bit of a problem. You see,
I did some research and when Emperor Reclaw was killed all the members
of the Imperial Family were also put to death. Including Shenara. When
the Third Dynasty was founded ten years later, a new group of Klingons
were given the titles and the names of the original Imperial Family to
create the illusion of an unbroken line. So the woman that you think of
as your twenty third maternal grandmother isn't related to you at all.
Your real ancestor's name was Karana, a concubine living outside the
Imperial stables. <br>
SIRELLA: My grandmother's name was Shenara. <br>
DAX: That may be what's been passed down from generation to generation,
but it has no basis in fact. But who cares about facts? The chronicle
says that you have imperial blood in your veins and that's exactly what
we'll telling everyone. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Leeta is dancing on a tabletop and the drum beat
is insistent. Kira and Nog are doing a Ferengi dance which is like cats
pouncing. Odo enters with two deputies.) <br>
ODO: I have been getting complaints about the noise. Someone even
mentioned a fight? <br>
KIRA: Oh, there was a scuffle between Morn and one of the Bolians, but
they worked it out. <br>
(Morn and the Bolian are doing a chest-butting dance.) <br>
ODO: How long will this party continue? <br>
KIRA: This party will continue until further notice, on the personal
authority of the station's First Officer, who just happens to be me. <br>
ODO: You're in a good mood. <br>
KIRA: Yeah, well, it's a good party. <br>
ODO: Well. <br>
KIRA: Odo. Odo, I think we have a lot to talk about. <br>
ODO: I agree. <br>
KIRA: So let's talk. <br>
ODO: Now? <br>
KIRA: Don't you think we've put it off long enough? <br>
ODO: (to the deputies) Enjoy yourselves. <br>
KIRA: Let's find someplace a little quieter. <br>
(Another fire dance has finished.) <br>
DAX: Thanks for the show. <br>
ATOA: Thanks for getting me the day off. <br>
DAX: Captain Shelby owed me a favour. Actually, he owed me several. In
fact, how would you like to have another two days off? <br>
ATOA: Two? What do I have to do? <br>
DAX: Not much. Just give me something fun to look at for the rest of
the evening. <br>
ATOA: Anything else? <br>
DAX: I'll let you know. <br>
SIRELLA: You! Leave her or I'll cut your head off and hang it from my
belt. <br>
DAX: I'll take care of this. You weren't invited. <br>
SIRELLA: It is time for the Bre'Nan ritual. <br>
DAX: I'm busy. <br>
SIRELLA: Busy acting like a Risian slut. <br>
DAX: I'm only going to ask you to leave once. <br>
SIRELLA: You will come with me now and perform the Bre'Nan ritual to my
satisfaction or I will cancel your wedding. <br>
DAX: Toruk-DOH! <br>
(Sirella draws her dagger but Dax disarms her and hits her.) <br>
NOG: Ladies, please! <br>
(Dax pushes Nog aside.) <br>
SIRELLA: Mok'Ta vor, kash a'VEH!<br>
(Sirella spits and leaves) <br>
DAX: Why is everyone standing around? The party's just getting started.
Play something. <br>
(Dax dances with Nog as Quark and Jake look at each other. Next
morning, Dax steps carefully over the wreckage.) <br>
DAX: Double raktajino, extra sweet. <br>
(Atoa and Morn are behind a couch.) <br>
ATOA: What time is it? <br>
DAX: Ten thirty hours. <br>
ATOA: Come on. <br>
DAX: Wrong door. <br>
(Atoa and Morn totter to the main door. It opens to reveal Worf.) <br>
ATOA: Excuse me, sir. <br>
(Atoa and Morn leave.) <br>
WORF: Jadzia, we need to <br>
(Dax gestures shush and sips her coffee.) <br>
DAX: You're mad. <br>
WORF: I am concerned. <br>
DAX: Yeah, well, I'm hung over. Can we talk later? <br>
WORF: We have a very serious problem. Sirella has cancelled the
wedding. <br>
DAX: She doesn't waste any time, does she? <br>
WORF: She said you attacked her. <br>
DAX: She pulled a knife.

DAX: So I won't get invited to the family picnics. I'll live. <br>
WORF: I cannot believe how you're taking this so lightly. <br>
DAX: Do you hear that? <br>
WORF: What? <br>
DAX: It sounds like voices. <br>

DAX: You could say that. It's ten thirty. <br>

ODO: So am I. <br>
KIRA: It was a great party. <br>
DAX: Thanks. <br>
(Kira and Odo leave. Dax goes back to bed.) <br>
WORF: We must deal with the situation now. <br>
DAX: Stop yelling. My head hurts. <br>
WORF: You must go to Sirella and beg her forgiveness. <br>
DAX: I don't beg. <br>
WORF: You are allowing your pride blind you. <br>
DAX: Look who's talking. You want me to go crawling to some old hag
just so you can have your traditional Klingon wedding. <br>
WORF: This is about more than just tradition. You and I have embarked
on a spiritual journey, one that will bind us together through this
life and into the next. You cannot turn back now. <br>
DAX: Maybe you're on a spiritual journey, Worf, but I just want to get
married. So why don't you go back to sweating and bleeding with your
friends in the holosuite and when you're done, meet me in Benjamin's
office and he'll perform the ceremony. <br>
WORF: If that is your attitude, perhaps Sirella was right about you.
There should be no wedding. <br>
DAX: That's fine with me.

BASHIR: What's going on? <br>
QUARK: Haven't you heard? The wedding's off. <br>
O'BRIEN: Off? Why? <br>
QUARK: She says it's because he's a pigheaded, stubborn man who puts
tradition before everything else. He says it's because she's a
frivolous, emotional woman who refuses to take him or his culture
seriously. You can see the problem. <br>
O'BRIEN: They're both right. <br>
QUARK: Exactly. <br>
BASHIR: Well, there's only one thing for it. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: Enter. <br>
MARTOK: Worf, you've made a grave error. <br>
WORF: Perhaps. <br>
MARTOK: Do you still love her? <br>
WORF: Of course. However, in this case, that may not be enough. Anyone
can see that we are hopelessly mismatched. She is a Trill, I am a
Klingon. She has had five marriages, this would be my first. When she
is laughing, I am sombre. When I am happy, she is crying. She plays
tongo with the Ferengi bartender. I can barely stand him. She mocks
everything, while I take everything seriously. She is nothing like the
woman I thought I would marry. <br>
MARTOK: We are not accorded the luxury of choosing the women we fall in
love with. Do you think Sirella is anything like the woman I thought
that I'd marry? She is a prideful, arrogant, mercurial woman who shares
my bed far too infrequently for my taste. And yet I love her deeply. We
Klingons often tout our prowess in battle, our desire for honour and
glory above all else. But how hollow is the sound of victory without
someone to share it with. Honour gives little comfort to a man alone in
his home and in his heart.

QUARK: One double Altair sandwich, no mustard, two bowls of linguini,
Bajoran shrimp and extra cheese. One loaf of mapa bread. <br>
BASHIR: Quark, where's the kava juice? <br>
QUARK: They're still squeezing the roots. Unless you want replicated? <br>

O'BRIEN: The wedding's been called off. <br>
SISKO: It's back on. <br>
MARTOK: Worf is apologising to Jadzia at this very moment. <br>
SISKO: Quark, take it all away. No food for those on the path to
Kal'Hyah. <br>
QUARK: No refunds for those on the path to Kal'Hyah as well. Sorry. <br>

ALEXANDER: Father, what happened? <br>
WORF: She refused to not change her mind. The wedding is still off. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Dax is displacing her anger by rearranging items
on a shelf.) <br>
DAX: Come in. Save your breath. Worf went too far and now it's over. Do
you know what he wanted me to do? He wanted me to go crawling on my
hands and knees to Sirella to beg her forgiveness. Beg her! Me! I was
once the Federation Ambassador to the Klingon Empire. I negotiated the
Khitomer Accords before Worf was even born. <br>
SISKO: Curzon negotiated the Accords. And I've got news for you, old
man. You're not Curzon anymore. <br>
DAX: And what the hell is that supposed to mean? <br>
SISKO: It means that you can't expect Sirella to treat you like Curzon
just because you carry his memories. To her, you're just a young woman
who decided to marry into her family. If it means you have to bow down
and kiss her boots, that's exactly what you have to do. And you knew
that. The moment you decided to marry Worf, you knew that sooner or
later you'd have to bow down and show her the respect that she's due. <br>
DAX: This is Worf's fault. Worf and his traditional Klingon wedding. <br>
SISKO: Well, he may have let this wedding business go to his head, but
you are three hundred fifty six years old. Compared to you, Worf is
just a kid. And if you can't abide by Klingon traditions, then you
never should have let yourself fall in love with him in the first
place. And you are in love with him. <br>
DAX: I wasn't looking to fall in love. I was perfectly happy by myself.
I had friends, a career, adventure. Then one day this Klingon with a
bad attitude walked into my life and the next thing I know, I'm getting
married. After three hundred fifty six years and seven lifetimes, I
still lead with my heart. <br>
SISKO: You know, that is what I have always loved about you. And I
think that's why Worf loves you, too. <br>
DAX: Whatever happened to that young, callow Ensign I used to know? The
one who used to turn to me for advice all the time? You know, the one
with hair? <br>
SISKO: I grew up. <br>
DAX: I guess it's time I grew up, too.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The decorations are back and kettledrums are
booming from the upper level. The lighting is deep red. Sirella walks
onto a stage lit by four braziers.) <br>
SIRELLA: With fire and steel did the gods forge the Klingon heart. So
fiercely did it beat, so loud was the sound, that the gods cried out,
'On this day we have brought forth the strongest heart in all the
heavens. None can stand before it without trembling at its strength.'
But then the Klingon heart weakened, its steady rhythm faltered and the
gods said, 'Why have you weakened so? We have made you the strongest in
all of creation. And the heart said <br>
WORF: I am alone. <br>
SIRELLA: And the gods knew that they had erred. So they went back to
their forge and brought forth another heart. <br>
(Enter Dax in her red leather wedding dress and broad smile. Alexander
brings two bat'leths.) <br>
SIRELLA: But the second heart beat stronger than the first, and the
first was jealous of its power. <br>
(Worf and Dax cross bat'leths, and she puts hers against his neck.) <br>
SIRELLA: Fortunately, the second heart was tempered by wisdom. <br>
DAX: If we join together, no force can stop us. <br>
(They give the bat'leths back to Alexander.) <br>
SIRELLA: And when the two hearts began to beat together, they filled
the heavens with a terrible sound. For the first time, the gods knew
fear. They tried to flee, but it was too late. The Klingon hearts
destroyed the gods who created them and turned the heavens to ashes. To
this very day, no one can oppose the beating of two Klingon hearts. Not
even me. Worf, son of Mogh, does your heart beat only for this woman? <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
SIRELLA: And will you swear to join with her and stand with her against
all who oppose you? <br>
WORF: I swear. <br>
SIRELLA: Jadzia, daughter of Kela, does your heart beat only for this
man? <br>
DAX: Yes. <br>
SIRELLA: And do you swear to join with him and stand with him against
all who would oppose you? <br>
DAX: I swear. <br>
SIRELLA: Then let all present here today know that this man and this
woman are married. <br>
(Worf kisses his bride.) <br>
BASHIR: Now? <br>
MARTOK: Not yet. <br>
(Sirella embraces Worf.) <br>
BASHIR: Now? <br>
MARTOK: Patience. <br>
(Dax curtseys to Sirella.) <br>
DAX: My lady. <br>
SIRELLA: Welcome to the House of Martok, my daughter. <br>
(Sirella and Dax embrace.) <br>
MARTOK: Now, Doctor! <br>
