CHAKOTAY: (native American with a tattoo) Damage report.<br>
TUVOK: (Vulcan) Shields at sixty percent.<br>
TORRES: (human-Klingon woman) A fuel line has ruptured. Attempting to
compensate. Damn it! We're barely maintaining impulse. I can't get any
more out of it.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Be creative!<br>
TORRES: How am I supposed to be creative with a thirty nine year old
rebuilt engine?<br>
GUL EVEK [on viewscreen]: Maquis ship, this is Gul Evek of the
Cardassian Fourth Order. Cut your engines and prepare to surrender or
we will d<br>

CHAKOTAY: Initiating evasive pattern omega. Mark.<br>
TUVOK: Shields at fifty percent.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I need more power if we're going to make it to the Badlands. <br>
TORRES: Take the weapons offline. We'll transfer all power to the
engines. <br>
TUVOK: Considering the circumstances, I question that proposal at this
time. <br>
TORRES: What does it matter? We're not making a dent in their shields
anyway! You wanted creative. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok, shut down all the phaser banks. If you can give me
another thirty seconds at full impulse, I'll get us into the Badlands. <br>
TUVOK: Phasers offline. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Throw the last photons at them and then give me the power
from the torpedo system.<br>
TUVOK: Acknowledged. Firing photons.<br>
(Two torpedoes explode against the Cardassian ship.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Are you reading any plasma storms ahead?<br>
TUVOK: One. Co-ordinates one seven one, mark four three.<br>
CHAKOTAY: That's where I'm going. <br>
TUVOK: Plasma storm density increasing by fourteen percent. Twenty.
Twenty five. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Hold on!<br>
(The little ship dodges around the plasma streamers.) <br>
TUVOK: The Cardassian ship is not reducing power. They're following us
in.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Gul Evek must feel daring today.<br>
TUVOK: They've taken a hit on their port blade. They're sending out a
distress signal on all Cardassian frequencies.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Can you plot a course through these plasma fields, Mister
Tuvok?<br>
TUVOK: The storm's activity is typically widespread in this vicinity. I
can plot a course, but I'm afraid it will require an indirect route.<br>
CHAKOTAY: We can use a time to make some repairs. What was that?<br>
TUVOK: Curious. We've just passed through some kind of coherent tetryon
beam.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Source?<br>
TUVOK: Unknown. Now there appears to be a massive displacement wave
moving toward us.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Another storm?<br>
TUVOK: It's not a plasma phenomenon. At current speeds, it will
intercept us in less than thirty seconds.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Anything left in those impulse generators, B'Elanna?<br>
TORRES: We'll find out.<br>
TUVOK: Still exceeding our speed.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Maximum power.<br>
TUVOK: Wave is continuing to accelerate. It will intercept us in eight
seconds. Five. <br>

JANEWAY: Tom Paris? Kathryn Janeway. I served with your father on the
Al-Batani. I wonder if we could go somewhere and talk.<br>
PARIS: About what?<br>
JANEWAY: About a job we'd like you to do for us.<br>
PARIS: I'm already doing a job for the Federation.<br>
JANEWAY: I've been told the Rehab Commission is very pleased with your
work. They've given me their approval to discuss this matter with you.<br>
PARIS: Well then, I guess I'm yours.<br>
(Walking through the trees.) <br>
JANEWAY: Your father taught me a great deal. I was his science officer
during the Orias expedition.<br>
PARIS: You must be good. My father only accepts the best and the
brightest.<br>
JANEWAY: I'm leaving on a mission to find a Maquis ship that
disappeared in the Badlands a week ago.<br>
PARIS: I wouldn't if I were you.<br>
JANEWAY: Really?<br>
PARIS: I've never seen a Federation starship that could manoeuvre
through the plasma storms.<br>
JANEWAY: You've never seen Voyager. We'd like you to come along.<br>
PARIS: You'd like me to lead you to my former colleagues. I was only
with the Maquis a few weeks before I was captured, Captain. I don't
know where most of their hiding places are.<br>
JANEWAY: You know the territory better than anyone we've got.<br>
PARIS: What's so important about this particular Maquis ship?<br>
JANEWAY: My Chief of Security was on board, undercover. He was supposed
to report in twice during the last six days. He didn't.<br>
PARIS: Maybe it's just your Chief of Security who's disappeared.<br>
JANEWAY: Maybe. That ship was under the command of another former
Starfleet officer, named Chakotay. I understand you knew him.<br>
PARIS: That's right.<br>
JANEWAY: The two of you didn't get along too well, I'm told. <br>
PARIS: Chakotay will tell you he left Starfleet on principle, to defend
his home colony from the Cardassians. I, on the other hand, was forced
to resign. He considered me a mercenary, willing to fight for anyone
who'd pay my bar bill. Trouble is, he was right. I have no problem
helping you track down my friends in the Maquis, Captain. All I need to
know from you is what's in it for me.<br>
JANEWAY: You help us find that ship, we help you at your next outmeet
review.<br>
PARIS: Ah ha.<br>
JANEWAY: Officially, you'd be a Starfleet observer during the mission.<br>
PARIS: Observer? Oh hell, I'm the best pilot you could have.<br>
JANEWAY: You'll be an observer. When it's over, you're cut loose.<br>

PARIS: Stadi, you're changing my mind about Betazoids. <br>
STADI: Good. <br>
PARIS: Oh, that wasn't a compliment. Until today I always considered
your people warm and sensual. <br>
STADI: I can be warm and sensual. <br>
PARIS: Just not to me. <br>
STADI: Do you always fly at women at warp speed, Mister Paris? <br>
PARIS: Only when they're in visual range. <br>
STADI: That's our ship. That's Voyager. <br>
(It is docked at an upper pylon.) <br>
STADI: Intrepid class. Sustainable cruise velocity of warp factor nine
point nine seven five. Fifteen decks. Crew complement of one hundred
and forty one. Bio-neural circuitry.<br>
PARIS: Bio-neural?<br>
STADI: Some of the traditional circuitry has been replaced by gel packs
that contain bio-neural cells. They organise information more
efficiently, speed up response time. <br>

very proud, my boy. You know, on an occasion like this <br>

QUARK: Interested?<br>

a memento of your first mission.<br>
KIM: And you happen to have several to choose from?<br>
QUARK: I do carry a select line of unique artefacts and gem stones
indigenous to this region. Why, quite recently, I acquired these Lobi

QUARK: Here I am, trying to be a cordial host, knowing how much a young
officer's parents would appreciate a token of his love on the eve of a
dangerous mission, and what do I get for my trouble? Scurrilous
insults. Well, somebody's going to hear about this. What's your name,
son?<br>
KIM: My name?<br>
QUARK: You have one, I presume?<br>
KIM: Kim, Harry Kim. But I <br>
QUARK: And who was it at the Academy who warned you about Ferengi?<br>
KIM: You know, I think a memento for my parents would be a great idea.<br>
QUARK: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. <br>
KIM: Really. What are these? It would make a great pendant for my
mother. <br>
QUARK: Or cufflinks for your father. <br>
KIM: Cufflinks. Great idea. <br>
QUARK: They're not for sale. Now, inform your commanding officer that
the Federation Council can expect an official query. <br>
KIM: How much for the entire tray?<br>
QUARK: Cash or credit?<br>
PARIS: (in uniform) Dazzling, aren't they? As bright as a Koladan
diamond.<br>
QUARK: Brighter.<br>
PARIS: Hard to believe you can find them on any planet in the system.<br>
QUARK: That's an exaggeration.<br>
PARIS: You know, there's a shop at the Volnar Colony that sells a dozen
assorted shapes for one Cardassian lek. How much are you selling these
for?<br>
QUARK: We were just about to negotiate the price.<br>

mouth shut and I was home free. But I couldn't. The ghosts of those
three dead officers came to me in the middle of the night and taught me
the true meaning of Christmas. So I confessed. Worst mistake I ever
made but not my last. After they cashiered me out of Starfleet, I went
out looking for a fight and found the Maquis. And on my first
assignment, I was caught.<br>

ship, and we have charts of the plasma storm activity the day it
disappeared. With a little help, we might be able to approximate its

sir. I am Captain Janeway's Chief of Security.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Were you going to deliver us into their waiting hands, Vulcan?<br>
TUVOK: My mission was to accumulate information on Maquis activities,
and then deliver you into their waiting hands. That is correct.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I see you had help.<br>
PARIS: It's good to see you too, Chakotay.<br>
CHAKOTAY: At least the Vulcan was doing his duty as a Starfleet
officer. But you, you betrayed us for what? Freedom from prison?
Latinum? What was your price this time?<br>
JANEWAY: You are speaking to a member of my crew. I expect you to treat
him with the same respect as you would have me treat a member of yours.
Now, we have a lot to accomplish, and I suggest we all concentrate on
finding our people and getting ourselves back home.<br>
TUVOK: Based on my initial reconnaissance, Captain, I am convinced we
are dealing with a single entity in the array. I would suggest he
scanned our computers in order to select a comfortable holographic
environment. In effect, a waiting room to pacify us prior to biometric
assessment.<br>
PARIS: An examination?<br>
TUVOK: It is the most logical explanation. Why else would he have
released us unharmed?<br>

Transporter Room two. We're going back. We'll divide into teams. Mister
Tuvok, while Chakotay and I are looking for Torres and Kim, your job is
to find out as much about this array as you can. It brought us here. We
have to assume it can send us home. Agreed? (Chakotay nods.) Mister
Rollins, maintain Red alert. Keep us on constant transporter locks.<br>

CARETAKER: You? I've searched the galaxy with methods beyond your
comprehension. No, there's nothing you can do.<br>
JANEWAY: You've taken us seventy thousand light years from our home. We
have no way back unless you send us, and we won't leave without the

They're getting faster. <br>
JANEWAY: Faster. <br>
TUVOK: The interval between each pulse has decreased by point four
seven seconds since we arrived. I can offer no explanation.<br>
JANEWAY: That's only one of the mysteries we're dealing with, Mister
Tuvok. Take a look at this. <br>
(A scan of the planet on her desk monitor.) <br>
JANEWAY: It's virtually a desert. Not one ocean, not one river. It has
all the basic characteristics of an M-class planet except there are no
nucleogenic particles in the atmosphere.<br>
TUVOK: That would mean the planet is incapable of producing rain.<br>
JANEWAY: I've studied thousands of M-class planets. I've never seen an
atmosphere without nucleogenics. There must have been some kind of
extraordinary environmental disaster. As soon as repairs are complete,

played clarinet in the Julliard Youth Symphony?<br>

know any of them. I have to, I have to take more time to do that. It's
a fine crew and I've got to get them home.<br>

in the galaxy, and brought here against your will.<br>

don't know if it'll help. It's a medicine. There are people who have
broken from tradition and left the city. Their colony grows fruits and
vegetables. They discovered quite by accident that the moss that grows
on certain fruit trees has healing properties. I'm sorry for what has
happened to you.<br>

can get to the surface and find our own people.<br>

NURSE: The Caretaker's been behaving strangely for the past several
months. Abducting people, increasing the power supply.<br>
KIM: Power supply.<br>
NURSE: He's tripled the energy he sends us. They say we have enough
stored now to run the city for five years.<br>
KIM: Nobody knows why?<br>
NURSE: When we ask, we're told to trust the Caretaker's decisions. One
person I knew did get to the surface. We never saw her again.<br>
KIM: How?<br>
NURSE: The ancient tunnels that brought us here still exist. Over the
years, small breaches in security barriers have appeared just large
enough for someone to get through. But it still requires digging
through metres of rock to get out.<br>

CHAKOTAY: If the array is the Ocampa's sole source of energy, why would
the Caretaker seal the conduits?<br>
TUVOK: He would seal them if he no longer intended to use them, to
protect the Ocampa from their enemies. Captain, there is now enough
evidence to form a reasonable hypothesis. I believe that the Caretaker
is dying.<br>
JANEWAY: Explain.<br>
TUVOK: First, he increases the energy supply to provide the city with a
surplus to last at least five years. Then he seals the conduits. The
logical conclusion is that he does not intend to continue his role as
Caretaker.<br>
CHAKOTAY: That doesn't necessarily mean he's dying. He could be leaving.<br>
TUVOK: Doubtful. Not after a millennium of providing for these people.
I believe that the Caretaker owes something to the Ocampa. I believe
the debt that can never repaid is very likely a debt to them. In
addition, there were his frequent references to running out of time. I
think he knew his death was imminent.<br>

JANEWAY: I can and I will. End transmission.<br>
KIM: They're increasing fire, Captain. Shields are holding.<br>
JANEWAY: Move us four hundred kilometres from the Array, Mister Paris.<br>
PARIS: Yes, ma'am.<br>
TORRES: What do you think you're doing? That Array is the only way we
have to get back home.<br>
JANEWAY: I'm aware everyone has families and loved ones at homes they
want to get back to. So do I. But I'm not willing to trade the lives of
the Ocampa for our convenience. We'll have to find another way home.<br>
TORRES: What other way home is there? Who is she to be making these
decisions for all of us?<br>
CHAKOTAY: She's the Captain.<br>
TUVOK: The tricobalt devices are ready.<br>
PARIS: We're in position.<br>
JANEWAY: Fire. <br>
(Two blue torpedoes strike the Array. Mega-KaBOOM as it falls apart.) <br>
KIM: The lead Kazon ship is hailing us. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. <br>
JABIN [on viewscreen]: You have made an enemy today. <br>
TUVOK: They are withdrawing, Captain. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Come in.<br>
PARIS: You asked to see me, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Paris, you have a problem. I've invited Chakotay and
the other Maquis to become part of this crew. It seemed the only
reasonable thing to do under the circumstances.<br>
PARIS: Will you provide a bodyguard for me, Captain?<br>
JANEWAY: It seems you already have one.<br>
PARIS: I do?<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Chakotay said something about his life belonging to
you? He'll be taking responsibility for your safety.<br>
PARIS: I think I'm going to enjoy this.<br>
JANEWAY: Don't be so sure. He'll also be my First Officer. Everyone
aboard this ship will report to him, including the lieutenant assigned
to conn.<br>
PARIS: Me?<br>
JANEWAY: I've entered into the ship's log on this date that I'm
granting a field commission of lieutenant to Thomas Eugene Paris.
Congratulations.<br>
PARIS: Er, for the first time in my life I don't know what to say.<br>
JANEWAY: You've earned this, Tom. I'm only sorry your father won't know.<br>
PARIS: Oh, he'll know. When we get back.<br>
(Paris leaves and Neelix and Kes come running across the Bridge.)<br>
NEELIX: Ah, Captain! We were just coming to see you.<br>
JANEWAY: We supplied your ship with water, Neelix. It's ready to go.<br>
NEELIX: Well, you see, that's what we wanted to discuss. We'd like to
go with you.<br>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry. This isn't a passenger ship.<br>
KES: Of course not. We won't be passengers.<br>
NEELIX: We'd be valuable colleagues.<br>
JANEWAY: Colleagues?<br>
NEELIX: Whatever you need is what I have to offer. You need a guide?
I'm your guide. You need supplies? I know where to procure them. I have
friends among races you don't even know exist. You need a cook? Oh, you
haven't lived until you've tasted my angla'bosque. It will be my job to
anticipate your needs before you know you have them. And I anticipate
your first need will be me.<br>
KES: Captain, we both want very much to be a part of your journey. <br>

(Chakotay and Torres are in Starfleet uniform. So is Ayala.) <br>
JANEWAY: We're alone in an uncharted part of the galaxy. We have
already made some friends here, and some enemies. We have no idea of
the dangers we're going to face, but one thing is clear. Both crews are
going to have to work together if we're to survive. That's why
Commander Chakotay and I have agreed that this should be one crew. A
Starfleet crew. And as the only Starfleet vessel assigned to the Delta
Quadrant, we'll continue to follow our directive to seek out new worlds
and explore space. But our primary goal is clear. Even at maximum
speeds, it would take seventy five years to reach the Federation, but
I'm not willing to settle for that. There's another entity like the
Caretaker out there somewhere who has the ability to get us there a lot
faster. We'll be looking for her, and we'll be looking for wormholes,
spatial rifts, or new technologies to help us. Somewhere along this
journey, we'll find a way back. Mister Paris, set a course for home.<br>
PARIS: Aye, Captain.<br>
