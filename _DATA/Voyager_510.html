<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(A younger black-haired Devore man is sitting at her desk.)<br>KASHYK:
Good morning, Captain. I took the liberty of playing this music
throughout your ship. I thought it might help your crew relax.
Sometimes these inspections can be stressful. <br>
JANEWAY: How thoughtful. <br>
KASHYK: I've replicated some coffee. Black, as usual? <br>
JANEWAY: Black. <br>
KASHYK: Prax here still refuses to try it but then, he's a man of few
pleasures. <br>(Prax and his guard leave.)<br>KASHYK: Captain, Please, make yourself at home. </font></p>

You've been routing power through your transporter system. Why? <br>
TORRES: It's a routine diagnostic. We've been having trouble with our
imaging scanners. <br>
PRAX: The problem is in the primary energising coils. Focus your
efforts there. <br>
TORRES: Thanks for the tip. </font></p>

PRAX: You are not a telepath. <br>
SEVEN: No. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Ready

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Kashyk admires an old microscope.)<br>KASHYK:
Remarkable. How old is this? <br>
JANEWAY: About six hundred years. My grandfather gave it to me when I
was a child. <br>
KASHYK: It seems you have a long-standing obsession with exploration,
Captain. I, on the other hand, have much more in common with this
ancient soldier. <br>
JANEWAY: He's from Earth's classical period. It produced some of our
greatest artists as well. <br>
KASHYK: Your culture has many contradictions. Violence and beauty,
science and faith, all somehow mingled harmoniously. Like the
counterpoint of this music. Mahler. Symphony Number One, am I correct? <br>
JANEWAY: You're getting to know my musical database better than I do. <br>
KASHYK: I've had time to review it since our last encounter. <br>
JANEWAY: Tell me, are all of your inspections this personal? <br>
KASHYK: I'm just trying to get to know you, Captain. There's no reason
for us to be adversaries. I could be your friend, and right now you
could certainly use one. <br>
JANEWAY: Really? Why is that? <br>
KASHYK: Your predicament? I don't expect it's been easy. Thousands of
light years from home, navigating by strange stars, trespassing in
other people's space, ignoring their laws. <br>
JANEWAY: We're just trying to get back to Earth, Inspector. <br>
KASHYK: Through the Devore Imperium? <br>
JANEWAY: It's tough to avoid. <br>
KASHYK: Still, most people make the effort. We don't exactly embrace
outsiders. <br>
JANEWAY: Gaharay? <br>
KASHYK: It means strangers. Which brings me to a matter that could
threaten our friendship. I've examined your crew manifest from our last
inspection. Commander Tuvok, Ensign Vorik. Vulcans. Ensigns Suder and
Jurot. Betazoids. All telepaths, and yet for some reason you neglected
to mention them. <br>
JANEWAY: For a very simple reason. They're dead. Tuvok, Vorik, and
Jurot died in a shuttle crash about two months ago. Suder was killed in
a conflict with a species called the Kazon. <br>
KASHYK: That's fortunate, for you I mean. If I'd known you were
harbouring telepaths I would have had to arrest you for breaking our
cardinal protocol. <br>
JANEWAY: They were valued members of my crew, Inspector, not criminals.
<br>
KASHYK: Perhaps. Captain do you trust me? <br>
JANEWAY: Not for a second. <br>
KASHYK: Exactly, and why should you? Trust has to be earned. It's
gradual. And yet it's the foundation of every relationship,
professional and personal. It's also a concept alien to the telepathic
races. Why take someone at their word when you can simply read their
mind? <br>(Prax enters.)<br>
PRAX: We've completed our inspection. There are no telepaths aboard.
However, their sensor logs indicate they deviated from their assigned
course on two occasions. <br>
JANEWAY: In both cases, to avoid ion storms. <br>
PRAX: Imperative thirty two, codicil six twenty six. All Gaharay
vehicles that deviate from prescribed flight vectors will be impounded,
their crews detained and relocated. <br>
KASHYK: Prax, it's clear the Captain didn't intend to break protocol. I
expect we can overlook these infractions. <br>
PRAX: Sir? (Kashyk gives him a &nbsp;Look.) Yes, sir. <br>
KASHYK: Captain, I'm a reasonable man, and you've been cooperative, but
consider this a reminder. You have a long trip through Devore space and
good friends can be an asset. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll keep it in mind. </font></p>

behind in your Cargo bay. <br>

better. Kir, we just received an encoded message from the transport vessel. <br>

degradation. I've repaired most of the damage but unfortunately the
effect is cumulative. <br>
KIR: Meaning? <br>
TUVOK: If we continue to go into transporter suspension, some of us may
not survive. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Bridge to Captain Janeway. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> SEVEN:
The new coordinates are here, within a Mutara-class nebula two point
three six light years from our current position. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's definitely out of the way. Less chance of being
discovered, but it'll take two more days to get there. <br>
JANEWAY: Two days. That increases the chances that we'll run into
another inspection. <br>
TUVOK: Given the frequency of patrols in that area, it's likely we'll
be stopped at least once. <br>
JANEWAY: Just what the Doctor didn't order. Tuvok, Seven, I want you to
lay in a course that'll attract as little attention as possible. Avoid
their colonies, space stations, tourist attractions, if they have any. </font></p>

The Ogre of Fire's Castle hovered over the forest like a great black
spaceship, turning day into night. Flotter and Trevis knew they had to
find a way to keep the Ogre from burning the forest down, but his
castle, it was higher than the tallest tree. It seemed hopeless, until
they discovered <br>(A boy speaks up.)<br>

they're telling a story. <br>
ADAR: I'm sorry. <br>
NEELIX: It's all right. <br>(Janeway enters.) <br>NEELIX: Why don't you all go play by yourselves for a
while. We'll finish the story later. <br>
JANEWAY: How are they doing? <br>
NEELIX: Oh, fine, more or less. They don't understand what all the fuss
is about, but they're telepaths, Captain. If the parents are concerned
or fearful the children feel it, too. You did the right thing. If we
hadn't taken them off that freighter, they'd be in a detention centre by
now. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, we're going to make sure that doesn't happen. Is the
kitchen still open or are you just serving stories? <br>

KASHYK [on viewscreen]: It's urgent that we speak. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Ready

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Kashyk is out of uniform.)<br>JANEWAY: It's all right, Ensign. I submitted to your previous
inspections because you outgunned me, but I don't see of your warships
nearby. I have no intention of cooperating. <br>
KASHYK: I'm not here to search Voyager. <br>
JANEWAY: Then what do you want, Inspector? <br>
KASHYK: Call me Kashyk, please. I never liked that title. In fact, I've
left it behind. <br>
JANEWAY: Did somebody offer you a promotion, or are you just having a
bad day? <br>
KASHYK: I'm defecting, and I need your help. <br>
JANEWAY: Me? <br>
KASHYK: I've come to ask asylum. Safe passage out of Devore space
before I end up in a detention centre myself. <br>
JANEWAY: Now, why would I risk the safety of my crew by harbouring a
defector? <br>
KASHYK: Because of what I'm about to tell you. If you continue on your
present course, you'll be intercepted by a squadron of my warships.
Voyager will be seized, your crew imprisoned or worse. The nebula is a
trap, Captain, to catch vessels smuggling telepaths. <br>
JANEWAY: You've inspected my ship three times. You know we aren't
smuggling telepaths or anyone else. <br>
KASHYK: What I know is that you have twelve refugees aboard right now.
That you rescued them from a freighter three weeks ago, and that you've
been concealing them in Cargo Bay one using your transporters. I could
have exposed them at any time, but I wanted them to escape as much as
you do. I can still protect them, but only if you take me with you. My
people know about the wormhole. It's only a matter of time before they
find it. You have no choice, Captain. I'm your only hope. </font></p>

JANEWAY: This is our rendezvous point, inside this nebula.
Unfortunately the transport vessel we're supposed to meet is no longer
there. Inspector. <br>(Kashyk magnifies another part of the nebula.)<br>
TUVOK: A Devore warship. <br>
JANEWAY: One of a dozen positioned throughout the nebula. All invisible
to our sensors until Kashyk showed me how to compensate for their
refractive shielding. <br>
SEVEN: Your soldiers intercepted the transport ship? <br>
KASHYK: Over a week ago. We were the ones who changed the rendezvous
coordinates. Two vessels carrying refugees have already been seized.
Voyager would have been next. <br>
JANEWAY: All right Inspector, you helped us avoid this ambush. What
now? <br>
KASHYK: We'll have to get your passengers to the wormhole on our own.
These are the schedules and routes of our patrols, along with tactical
data on our shield and weapons configurations. Enough to ensure that
you avoid another inspection. <br>
JANEWAY: How long before you're missed? <br>
KASHYK: Well, I took two weeks leave. Enough time, I hope, to find the
wormhole and get your passengers safely through it and myself, as well. <br>
TUVOK: Your data is useful, but it doesn't guarantee our success. <br>
KASHYK: No, for that you'll need my guidance and some luck. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll have to take this up with the Brenari. See what they
think of their new benefactor. I'll let you know what they decide. I'll
have to insist you remain under guard. No hard feelings. <br>
KASHYK: No hard feelings. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIR:
It's unusual, but not unheard of. There have been sympathisers before.
Kashyk may be telling the truth. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe you should just read his thoughts. <br>
KIR: Devore soldiers undergo years of mental training to prevent that. <br>
TUVOK: He might be telling the truth, but he also might be using us to
find the wormhole. <br>
CHAKOTAY: So what do we do, throw him in the Brig? <br>
JANEWAY: No, we take him up on his offer to help, see how it plays out.
But I want round the clock security. We need to watch his every
movement. That leaves us with our next question. How do we find the
wormhole? <br>
KIR: I've given it some thought. There's a scientist named Torat. He's
from a nearby system. He's rumoured to know more about the wormhole
than anyone. He might help us, for a price. <br>
JANEWAY: A price? <br>
KIR: His species power their ships with a fluidic alloy that's
difficult to find. <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps we can replicate it. <br>
KIR: I have some data on it's composition. <br>

Torat's planet, try to track him down. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Until today, you were part of a government responsible for
persecuting thousands of innocent people. Why the sudden change of
heart? <br>
KASHYK: There's nothing sudden about it. I've been looking for a way to
escape for years. Voyager was the perfect opportunity. <br>
JANEWAY: How so? <br>
KASHYK: Well, what are you suggesting? I ask a Brenari vessel for
assistance? They'd throw me out an airlock. Besides, you're something
of a humanitarian, Captain. I've read your database. I know all about
Starfleet philosophy. Unless you left those ideals behind in the Alpha Quadrant? <br>
JANEWAY: I certainly don't grant asylum to every person I meet.
Especially ones who ransack my ship and terrorise my crew. You're
asking me to believe you're someone else, and that's a leap of faith
I'm not ready to make. <br>
KASHYK: You're turning me away. <br>
JANEWAY: No. No, I'm going to give you safe passage to the wormhole in
return for your help in getting us there, but I'm also imposing some
restrictions. You'll have your own quarters but limited access to
Voyager's systems and your whereabouts will be monitored at all times. <br>
KASHYK: I'm used to being surrounded by armed guards. Makes me feel
secure. <br>
JANEWAY: Only this time they answer to me. Consider them a reminder
that Voyager is my ship. <br>

such a need to align yourselves with monolithic organisations? <br>

you care to raise if you would just slow down and talk. <br>

JANEWAY: Twenty centilitres of mercurium isochromate. No impurities,
and this is just a sample. We've synthesised enough to power your ship
for a year. <br>
TORAT: It doesn't matter. I've never heard of this wormhole you're
looking for, or these so-called refugees. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, they've heard of you. <br>
TORAT: Well, no doubt. My research is famous. <br>
JANEWAY: Think of all the stars you could research once you've infused
your propulsion system with this. <br>
TORAT: There's no point in bribing me. <br>
KASHYK: He's right. He couldn't help us if he wanted to. <br>
TORAT: What do you mean by that? <br>
KASHYK: I doubt you'd know a wormhole from a dark matter inversion. <br>
JANEWAY: Professor Kashyk is another expert I've retained to help us
with this matter. I'm afraid he's not as impressed with your work as I
am. In fact, he discouraged me from seeking you out. <br>
TORAT: Professor Kashyk? Never heard of you. <br>
KASHYK: Not surprising, considering you toil in scientific obscurity. <br>
TORAT: Obscurity! I've discovered over sixty astronomical phenomena! <br>
KASHYK: Not worth the sensors they were recorded on. <br>
JANEWAY: There's no need to insult the man. Just because he doesn't
know how to find an interspatial flexure. <br>
TORAT: Interspatial flexure? Why didn't you say so in the first place?
He said wormhole, a layman's term that that covers any number of
phenomena. I am familiar with a certain anomaly that could be
categorised as an interspatial flexure. <br>
KASHYK: Where is it? <br>
TORAT: Actually, a better question would be, where is it now? It's
really quite interesting. The aperture of the phenomenon, which I prefer
to call an intermittent cyclical vortex, is unfixed. It manifests
infrequently for only brief periods of time and in varying locations. I
can give you the last four locations. Perhaps you can extrapolate the

KASHYK: I'm thinking. <br>
JANEWAY: Think harder. Four wormhole appearances less than twenty
light years apart. There's no pattern. <br>
KASHYK: Did you apply a fractal coefficient? <br>
JANEWAY: Didn't work. <br>
KASHYK: Neutrino flux parameters? Statistical algorithms? <br>
JANEWAY: Every one I could find. This wormhole defies analysis. Maybe
Torat was right. We're just out of our league. <br>
KASHYK: It's not like you to give up. Think harder. <br>
JANEWAY: How do you predict a random occurrence? <br>
KASHYK: You follow your instincts. Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: Counterpoint. It's in all great music. Parallel melodies
playing against one another. We've been looking at the obvious,
frequency, location, timing, but each of those parameters could have a
counterpoint in subspace. <br>
KASHYK: If we could run an algorithm based on subspace harmonics, it
might reveal our pattern. <br>
JANEWAY: Computer, run a subspatial transkinetic analysis on the
wormhole data. <br>
COMPUTER: Analysis in progress. <br>
JANEWAY: This'll take a minute. <br>
KASHYK: I'm going to miss this coffee of yours. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, I will give you the recipe. <br>
KASHYK: Thank you. <br>
JANEWAY: You don't sound too happy about leaving. <br>
KASHYK: The Brenari aren't about to embrace a former Inspector. I'll be
feared, hated for what I represent. <br>
JANEWAY: Anxiety doesn't become you, Inspector. Try to relax a little. <br>
KASHYK: I suppose you liked me better in uniform. <br>
JANEWAY: I haven't decided whether I like you at all. <br>(He looks at a series of coloured lights visible through the window.)<br>
KASHYK: We call them the Kolyan Kolyar. Infinite Spirals. <br>
JANEWAY: Beautiful. <br>
KASHYK: As a boy, I spent years gazing at these lights. This is the
last time I'll ever see them. <br>
JANEWAY: We have something similar back on Earth. The Aurora Borealis. <br>
KASHYK: Which you too may never see again. I suppose we're both
refugees, in a way. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm still counting on getting this ship home. <br>
KASHYK: Are you sure you'll be welcome when you do? I came across
something else in your database. The Prime Directive. <br>
JANEWAY: The Federation's cardinal protocol. <br>
KASHYK: It seems you violated it when you rescued these telepaths. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, let's just say I usually go with my instincts and sort
it out later at the Board of Inquiry. Those Admirals and I were on a
first name basis, you know. You're risking a lot, too. Why? <br>
KASHYK: Three months ago my teams were inspecting a plasma refining
vessel. We found a family of telepaths hiding in one of the extraction
tanks. There was a child, very young. She'd been inside it for days,
barely able to breathe. When I lifted her out and set her down on the
deck, she thanked me. I sent her to a relocation centre with the others,
knowing full well what would happen to her. After that, I could think
of nothing else, and when I couldn't stand it any longer. You're my
deliverance, Captain. <br>
COMPUTER: Analysis complete. <br>
JANEWAY: It worked. It looks like it'll appear in about three days,
less than eight light years from here. <br>
KASHYK: The Tehara system. <br>
JANEWAY: Is that a problem? <br>
KASHYK: There's an automated sensor array between here and Tehara. <br>
JANEWAY: Can we go around it? <br>
KASHYK: We'd never make it in time. We'll have to find a way to avoid
detection. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's do it in the morning. We've done enough for tonight. Are
you saying goodbye? There will be other spirals. <br>
KASHYK: They've just never looked quite so beautiful before. Could be
the company I'm keeping. <br>
JANEWAY: Or the polarisation axis of the windows. <br>
KASHYK: That must be it. </font></p>

JANEWAY: How often does this array emit a scanning pulse? <br>
KASHYK: Every forty seconds. <br>
JANEWAY: Range? <br>
KASHYK: Ten light years. The pulse is designed to track warp fields and
impulse signatures. If we lower our power output to beneath it's
detection threshold <br>
JANEWAY: We could drift past undetected. <br>
KASHYK: It's worth a try. <br>(They arrive at Kashyk's quarters.)<br>
JANEWAY: Well, good night. <br>
KASHYK: Captain, why don't you join me? I've been looking forward to
trying your replicator. Well, I'm sure that I can come up with something
to toast the evening. We've accomplished quite a bit today. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm afraid that won't be possible. I had your replicator taken
offline. <br>
KASHYK: In case I decided to replicate a weapon. <br>
JANEWAY: A safety precaution. You understand. <br>
KASHYK: Better than anyone. <br>

that you follow my orders. <br>

against two. If I stay your best chance of escape will be lost. <br>
JANEWAY: I could confine you to quarters. I was planning on asking you
to stay with us once we got through the wormhole. I wouldn't mind
having someone around who appreciates a bit of Tchaikovsky now and
then. <br>

our protocols for Captain Janeway. <br>(Prax leaves.) <br>

bow. We've determined that a photon torpedo properly calibrated will
force open the threshold long enough for Voyager to get through. <br>
