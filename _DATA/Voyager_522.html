Good morning. <br>
JANEWAY: Morning. <br>
NEELIX: Requisition reports for the week. <br>
JANEWAY: Thanks. <br>
NEELIX: What can you tell me about the Great Wall of China? <br>
JANEWAY: Pardon? <br>
NEELIX: The Great Wall of China, on Earth. Who built it? <br>
JANEWAY: The Chinese. <br>
NEELIX: What for? <br>
JANEWAY: Why does anybody build a wall? To keep people out.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Deck one. <br>
NEELIX: In fact it was the first Q'in emperor who connected the walls
built by a previous dynasty. He did it to prevent an invasion by nomads
to the north. How big is it? <br>
JANEWAY: I have a feeling you're going to tell me. <br>
NEELIX: Twenty four hundred kilometres long, median width three point
eight metres. Before the twenty second century, it was one of the only
manmade objects that could be seen from Earth's orbit with the naked
eye. <br>(Untrue. http://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/workinginspace/great_wall.html)<br>

my homeworld.

Mister Paris and I have been exchanging a little cross-cultural trivia.
He's become quite an expert on Talaxian geography. <br>
JANEWAY: All right, here's one for you. What can you tell me about the
Millennium Gate? <br>
NEELIX: The Millennium Gate. Constructed in the 21st century in the
United States of America. It was another one of the objects that could
be seen from orbit. Er, three point two kilometres at the base, one
kilometre in height, surface covered with highly reflective solar
panels. A self-contained ecosystem. <br>
JANEWAY: It became a model for the first colony on Mars. Did you know
that one of my ancestors built it? <br>
NEELIX: Really? <br>
JANEWAY: Not with a hammer and nails, but with words and a lot of
courage. Shannon O'Donnel, one of the first woman astronauts. She was
the driving force behind the project. <br>
NEELIX: That's something to be proud of. <br>
JANEWAY: We were always told stories about her at family gatherings.
The first of a long line of Janeway explorers. <br>
NEELIX: Tell me more. I want something to stump Mister Paris with. <br>
JANEWAY: Where to begin? <br>
NEELIX: The Millennium Gate. How did she get involved with that? <br>
JANEWAY: Well, at that time, she was still in the space programme, but
she'd also become something of an entrepreneur. I believe she was asked
to join the project by the governor of Indiana. He wanted her expertise
on recyclic life support systems. The way my aunt Martha, tells it they
flew her in on a private aircraft.

HENRY: Yes, that's right. Till six o'clock. Can we be of assistance? <br>

SHANNON: Hi. So, you're trying to get them to stop building this
Millennium whatever-it-is? <br>
JASON: The Millennium Gate. The world's first self-sustaining civic
environment. <br>
HENRY: That's what the propaganda calls it. It's nothing but hype. It's
actually a glorified shopping mall. They've talked all of my neighbours
into selling their businesses. Only one thing stands in their way. <br>

HENRY: The City Fathers made it easy for them. Free building permits,
deferred taxes, new roads, so the invaders, they return the favour.
They have offered us twenty percent above the market price for our
properties. You know what the catch is? We've all got to sell. <br>
SHANNON: Everybody must love you. <br>
HENRY: People I knew when I was growing up, family, friends, it seems
like they've all just turned against me. If this were Roman times,
they'd feed me to the lions. <br>
SHANNON: To the good old days. <br>
HENRY: You know, I was born in the wrong millennium. <br>

plans for the Millennium Eve? <br>

asleep. <br>
HENRY: Life of the party. <br>
SHANNON: Oh, don't tell me you've bought into all that hype again? <br>
HENRY: Oh, maybe just a little. <br>
SHANNON: Last year, when 2000 arrived? Everyone was convinced it was
the dawn of a new era. But when the world didn't end and the flying
saucers didn't land and the Y2K bug didn't turn off a single light
bulb, you'd think everybody would have realised it was a number on a
calendar. But, oh, no, they had to listen to all those hucksters who
told them the real millennium was 2001. So this New Year's Eve will be
as boring as last year. <br>
HENRY: Come to think about it, I have sold an awful lot of doomsday
books. <br>
SHANNON: See what I mean? <br>
HENRY: So, what's in Florida? <br>
SHANNON: I have a cousin down there. I'll stay with her for a while
until I can get back on my feet. <br>
HENRY: If you don't mind my asking, did you lose your job? <br>
SHANNON: I'm in a transitional period. <br>
HENRY: From what to what. <br>
SHANNON: From what I was doing to what I'm going to do. Your son tells
me that your bookstore's belonged in your family for generations. That
you've never done anything else. <br>
HENRY: Yes, that's right. <br>
SHANNON: You know, I'm just the opposite. I love to see places I've
never been, try new things. I'm kind of an explorer. <br>

like a sailing ship. <br>

SHANNON: Come on, there's got to be somebody. <br>
JASON: Dad. I mean, he's a pain sometimes, but he's pretty cool. (phone
rings) Alexandria Books, may I help you? That's all right. First call
in three days and it's a wrong number.<br>(The television Countdown to Midnight films Henry returning to the store with 12:10:50 to go.)<br>HENRY:

JASON: Hey, Dad you're famous. <br>(A picture of his confrontation with Moss is on the newspaper front page.)<br>
SHANNON: Local business owner topples Gate. <br>
HENRY: Let it fall. Any customers this morning? <br>
JASON: No one here but us galliforms. <br>
SHANNON: That's chickens for the non-scientists in the crowd. <br>
HENRY: You two are dangerous together. Portage Creek will thank us one
day. You don't sacrifice history for a shopping mall. <br>
SHANNON: It's a little more than that, Henry. <br>
HENRY: I beg your pardon? <br>
SHANNON: I said, it's not just a mall. <br>
HENRY: Have you read the promotional literature? Over six hundred
retail spaces available. Franchise potential. <br>
SHANNON: There's a commercial dimension to the project, but that's not
its only function. <br>
HENRY: What's your point? <br>
SHANNON: I've learned a few details about the Millennium Gate. It's a
self-sustaining city, an experimental biosphere. It's never been done
before. <br>
HENRY: What's wrong with the biosphere we're living in now? <br>
SHANNON: Nothing. <br>
HENRY: Exactly. <br>
SHANNON: But this project will help scientists learn more about our
environment. Possibly even recreate it on other worlds. <br>
HENRY: Other worlds? Don't we have enough problems on the one we're on?
<br>
SHANNON: Yeah. Which is why I'd like to get the hell off it one day. <br>
HENRY: I think you're taking this exploring a little too far. <br>
SHANNON: And you're so afraid of change you can barely walk out that
front door. The Millennium Gate has a lot of potential, Henry. You just
can't see it. All you can see are these books. You're living in the
past. <br>

SHANNON: Having a beer, anyway. <br>
HENRY: Moss. <br>
SHANNON: He offered me a job. <br>
HENRY: Doing what? <br>
SHANNON: Consulting engineer. <br>
HENRY: On the Millennium Gate? <br>
SHANNON: I said I'd think about it. <br>
HENRY: And he said, get Janeway to sign on the dotted line and you're
hired? <br>
SHANNON: That's one way of looking at it. <br>
HENRY: And when I say no, then what? You're going to go with them,
right? To Canton, Ohio, or the Third Circle of Hell, or wherever it is
they decide to build this damn thing. <br>
SHANNON: I can't keep living out of my car. <br>
HENRY: You don't have to. Stay here. <br>
SHANNON: No. <br>
HENRY: Why not? <br>
SHANNON: Because I can't. <br>
HENRY: That's not a reason. <br>
SHANNON: Because I don't want to! You've been really nice to me, Henry,
but I can't get stuck here. <br>
HENRY: Stuck? Like me? <br>
SHANNON: I didn't say that. You can live however you want to. <br>
HENRY: And so can you. <br>(Henry holds out the bag and Shannon puts her laptop into it.)<br>
JASON: What's going on? <br>
HENRY: We're helping our guest resume her journey. <br>
JASON: But I thought you were staying here for a while. <br>
SHANNON: Something came up. <br>
HENRY: We can manage by ourselves. I guess saying goodbye isn't that
difficult after all. <br>(Jason runs after Shannon.)<br>HENRY: Jason. Jason, where you going? <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM: It
was around 2210. My uncle Jack was on a deep space mission to Beta
Capricus. <br>
PARIS: That's when deep space meant the next star over. <br>
KIM: And that was when they still had to go into stasis. So, Jack put
his crew under as soon as they left orbit, and piloted the ship by
himself for six months. <br>
NEELIX: No contact with anybody along the way? <br>
KIM: There wasn't anybody along the way. Not back then. The transmitter
wasn't even subspace. It took weeks to get a message back to Earth. <br>
SEVEN: I would prefer stasis. <br>
PARIS: Me too. That long alone, I'd probably go a little batty. <br>
KIM: So, six months to Beta Capricus and when they finally arrive,
there's nothing there. <br>
NEELIX: No planets? <br>
KIM: No. No star, no nothing. It turns out Beta Capricus was just an EM echo of a distant galaxy. <br>
SEVEN: What was his course of action? <br>
KIM: What else could he do? He turned the ship around and headed home. <br>
JANEWAY: And the crew? <br>
KIM: He figured there was no reason to bother them. There's nothing to
see, nothing to do. So six months later he gets back to Earth, brings
everybody out of stasis, and they wake up wondering why they haven't
left orbit. <br>(Doorbell) <br>JANEWAY: Come in. <br>
EMH: Oh. I didn't realise you were in a briefing.&nbsp;<br>
JANEWAY: Not at all. We're talking about our family histories. <br>
EMH: Oh. This can wait. May I join you? <br>
JANEWAY: Please. <br>
EMH: I, too, come from a distinguished line. <br>
PARIS: His cousin's an electric shaver. <br>
EMH: Hardly. My programme was compiled from the most advanced
holo-matrices in the Federation. My cousin was a prize-winning chess
programme. <br>
SEVEN: Ensign Paris, you have yet to elaborate on your family origins. <br>
PARIS: Well, they were a pretty ordinary bunch, salt of the earth type
people. Farmers, mostly. Some planetary colonists. Ah, but there was
one. He was a pilot. He flew the first orbital glider over the lower
Martian plateau. <br>
NEELIX: Mars? Your ancestor must have known the Captain's.<br>JANEWAY: She did work on all the early Mars projects. Looks like we go
way back, Mister Paris. <br>
PARIS: What was her name? <br>
JANEWAY: Shannon O'Donnel. <br>
PARIS: O'Donnel. I don't think so. <br>
JANEWAY: What do you mean? <br>
PARIS: Well, I know all the Mars projects from the 1970s on. Unmanned,
manned, who's who. There were no O'Donnels in any of them. <br>(Janeway has found the newspaper article.)<br>JANEWAY:
Come in. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Ship's status report. <br>
JANEWAY: Let me guess. The holographic engineer is having problems with
her programme. Neelix, the Cardassian cook, is low on supplies. Seven
of Twelve is regenerating and Captain Chakotay is doing just fine. Just
wondering how they'll piece together our lives a few hundred years from
now. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Depends on how big the pieces are. <br>
JANEWAY: A PADD here, a Captain's log there, maybe a couple of holodeck
programmes. It won't be as much to go on as we might think. I've gone
through dozens of histories written about twenty first century Earth,
all of them biased in one way or another. The Vulcans describe First
Contact with a savagely illogical race. Ferengi talk about Wall Street
as if it were holy ground. The Bolians express dismay at the low
quality of human plumbing. And human historians? Exact same story.
Every culture saw it a different way. So I go back to the raw material.
Birth certificates, death certificates, marriage certificates, census
surveys, voter registration forms, housing records, medical,
employment, court records. It's all fragmented and incomplete. <br>
CHAKOTAY: So, did she exist? <br>
JANEWAY: Her name was Shannon O'Donnel. She did train to be an
astronaut, but she didn't finish. She was an engineer, but never worked
on the Mars missions. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Did she work on the Millennium Gate? <br>
JANEWAY: Only as a consultant. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What about all the opposition you spoke of? You said she
fought to get the project underway. <br>
JANEWAY: There was no opposition. In fact, the Millennium Gate was
greeted with open arms by the local population. Except for one man. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Henry Janeway. <br>
JANEWAY: She married him, and changed her name. But she certainly never
changed history. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Don't be too hard on her. She may not have known she was
supposed to live up to your expectations. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, I'll get over it. The question is, when we get back to
Earth, how will I break the news to Aunt Martha?

Portage Creek is concerned. It's a shame how one ignorant man can stand

not here. (Moss gives Shannon a business card.)<br>MOSS: My associate in Canton. I'll tell him you're on the way.
