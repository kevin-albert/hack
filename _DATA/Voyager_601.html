log: stardate 53049.2. We've docked at the Markonian outpost and agreed
to mutual visits, so I'm allowing shore leave to anyone who wants it.

security issues aside, I'm looking forward to a cultural exchange, and
making some new friends. </font></p>

ends as they flap around.)<br>CHAKOTAY:
Captain? <br>(There is a large plant on her desk, others by the window and many more bits and pieces scattered around the room.) <br>
JANEWAY: I'll be right with you. The station manager didn't tell me the
vines were prehensile. I went to put some water in the pot and it
grabbed me. <br>
CHAKOTAY: This is a gift from the Kinbori delegation. I don't know its
name, only that it's used in one of their sacred games and it's very
heavy. <br>
JANEWAY: Put it down anywhere. Thank the Kinbori for me and give them a
token of our esteem. <br>(She hands Chakotay a book.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: I already gave them a Voyager medallion. They seemed
appreciative. <br>
JANEWAY: Come in. Doesn't it look like Christmas morning in here,
Commander? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You have to admit the generosity of our guests is very
impressive. <br>
TUVOK: As is their proclivity for criminal behaviour. This morning's
security report. <br>
JANEWAY: A broken ODN line, some missing personal items, a damaged
scanner relay. All in all, not that bad. <br>
TUVOK: There is a second page to the report. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh. Some of these incidents are a little more serious but, on
balance, I still think we did the right thing. <br>
TUVOK: There is a third page. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Come on, Tuvok. After all the xenophobic races we've run
into, don't you find it just a little refreshing to meet some people
who value openness and freedom? <br>
JANEWAY: Well as far as I'm concerned, opening the ship has been a
fascinating experience and an unqualified success. I'm very pleased. <br>

with it, I was overwhelmed with images, memories, sounds. <br>
TORRES: Sounds like a perfectly natural reaction to me. That was part
your old unimatrix, right? Well, isn't it at least possible that what
you experienced was simply nostalgia? You know, sentimental feelings
about the past. <br>

worked in Engineering. <br>

access these memory files again. Initiate the prescribed maintenance

SEVEN: Not at first. But when they attempted to access my memory files
I was momentarily linked with them. Two of Nine. Three of Nine. Four of
Nine. We were all members of the same Unimatrix. <br>

SEVEN: No. <br>
JANEWAY: How long have they been disconnected from the Collective? <br>
EMH: Three or four months. However, they are still connected to each
other. Somehow, the left parietal lobes of their brains have been
transformed into organic interlink nodes. They've become linked
together into a sort of Collective Triad. <br>

escaped. <br>

need to know how the link was created, but our memories are <br>

JANEWAY: I see. Perhaps you could explain to me how this friendly game
turned into a street brawl? <br>
PARIS: Well, Harry and I wanted to explore the station. We wanted
to broaden our understanding of alien cultures and, er <br>
JANEWAY: Skip the recruiting speech. You were looking for a bar. Then
what? <br>
KIM: Well, we found one, and we met a pair of Kinbori who told us about
this game they play with these big, odd-looking rackets. <br>
JANEWAY: You mean one of those? <br>
BOTH: Yeah! <br>
PARIS: In any case, they challenged us to a game and we accepted, but I
guess we weren't quite aware of all the rules. <br>
JANEWAY: Because you'd been drinking. <br>
PARIS: Yes, ma'am. You see, we thought it was a version of tennis, but
as soon as we hit the first volley this Kinbori jumps over the net and
starts attacking us with his racket. <br>
KIM: So we figured we were supposed to fight back. <br>
PARIS: Yeah. <br>
KIM: And then, er, well, things got a little out of hand. <br>
JANEWAY: A little out of hand? Seven Voyager crewmen, including two
bridge officers, along with thirteen Kinbori and one Morphinian café
owner, all arrested. The charges range from disorderly conduct to
assault on a security officer. <br>
KIM: That last one's not true. <br>
JANEWAY: Thank you, Mister Kim. I'll note that exception in my log.
You're both confined to quarters until further notice, after you report
to Sickbay. That's all. Well, did you win? <br>
PARIS: Oh yes, ma'am. <br>
KIM: We kicked their rackets. <br>
JANEWAY: Good. Dismissed. <br>(Paris and Kim leaves, Seven enters.)<br>JANEWAY: Any progress? <br>
SEVEN: I've determined that we all have exactly the same gap in our
memories. It seems unlikely that it would be a coincidence. <br>
JANEWAY: So you believe the Collective deliberately wiped your
recollections of the reassimilation process? <br>
SEVEN: It is the most likely explanation. <br>
JANEWAY: But? <br>
SEVEN: The Collective would not care that four drones remember being
reassimilated. <br>
JANEWAY: Something must have happened during the process. Something
they wanted to hide from you. Let's look at this from a different
perspective. Why would the Collective lock them into a neural triad in
the first place? <br>
SEVEN: I don't know. There is no advantage to having three drones
linked together in this manner. <br>
JANEWAY: They obviously did it for some reason. And I get the feeling
that if we can answer that question, the rest should fall into place.
But I wish we could find a way to close the gaps in your memories. <br>
SEVEN: There is a way. <br>
JANEWAY: I assume there's a reason you didn't mention it before now? <br>
SEVEN: It would involve linking my neural interface to theirs.
Together, we may be able to restore the missing data. However, I would
again be part of a group mind. <br>
JANEWAY: You're not eager to revisit that experience, hmm? <br>
SEVEN: There's also the possibility that I could become trapped in the
neural link. <br>
JANEWAY: Turning the triad into a quartet. I won't ask you to take that
kind of risk. <br>
SEVEN: I do feel compelled to help them, but I am uncertain as to the
correct course of action. <br>
JANEWAY: Let me ask you something. Do you think of these people as
family? <br>
SEVEN: Is it relevant? <br>
JANEWAY: There's an old saying. Blood is thicker than water. It means
that the ties of family run deeper than any other kind of relationship.
We'll often do things for members of our family we'd never dream of
doing for anyone else.

SEVEN OF NINE: We are Borg. Our primary function is to serve the Collective. <br>
TWO OF NINE: Not anymore. <br>(Two smashes the communications beacon.)<br>
SEVEN OF NINE: Error. Input failure. <br>
TWO OF NINE: They may know what planet we're on, but without the beacon
it'll be far more difficult to locate us. <br>
THREE OF NINE: If we can remodulate our cortical implants, we might be
able to elude their sensors. <br>
TWO OF NINE: We must leave this place. <br>
SEVEN OF NINE: This discussion is in violation of all established protocols. <br>
THREE OF NINE: You stay here and be reassimilated if you want to. I
won't. <br>(They
leave Seven alone. She paces around as the camp fire dies. Later, she
finds Four and stuns him. Then she inserts tubules into him.)<br>FOUR OF
NINE: What are you doing? <br>
SEVEN OF NINE: The nanoprobes will create new interlink nodes in your left
hemisphere. Resistance is futile. <br>(A
few moments later, he gets up and follows her. They find Two, and Seven
does the same to him. They finally catch up to Three.)<br>THREE OF
NINE: I will not comply. I will not comply. <br>(Seven injects her.)<br>
SEVEN OF NINE: State your designations. <br>
TWO OF NINE: Two of Nine. Primary adjunct of Unimatrix zero one. <br>
THREE OF NINE: Three of Nine. Auxiliary processor of Unimatrix zero
one. <br>
FOUR OF NINE: Four of Nine. Secondary adjunct of Unimatrix zero one. <br>
SEVEN OF NINE: What is your primary function? <br>
ALL: To serve the Collective. <br>
SEVEN OF NINE: You will repair the communications beacon.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TWO: It was you. You were responsible. What have you done to us? <br>
THREE: You linked us together. <br>
FOUR: You're responsible for our suffering. <br>
THREE: How could you do it? <br>
TWO: If you didn't want to return to the Collective<br>
THREE: You didn't have to. <br>
SEVEN: You don't understand what happened. <br>(All three shout at her at the same time.)<br>SEVEN:&nbsp;Somebody help me! <br>(Tuvok enters.)<br>
TUVOK: What's happening? <br>
EMH: Somehow they broke their link with Seven. They're malfunctioning.
Help me get them to Sickbay. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH:
When they broke the connection with you, it must have overloaded
their cortical implants. They went into neural shock. <br>
SEVEN: And yet I was undamaged? <br>
EMH: I think I know why. You said you remembered injecting them with
nanoprobes eight years ago. <br>
SEVEN: Yes. It created an interlink between them. It was the only way
to prevent them from escaping the Collective. <br>
EMH: Well, it seems to have had an unfortunate side effect. Their
higher brain functions were somehow tied into the interlink. When they
broke their connection with you in the cargo bay, the shock to their
cognitive systems was too great. <br>
SEVEN: Can you revive them? <br>
EMH: I can remove the microcortical implants. That would break the
link binding them together, but it would also kill them. They'd only
live a matter of weeks. A month at the most. <br>
SEVEN: What are the other options? <br>
EMH: They could be returned to the Borg. If they were reassimilated
into the Collective, they would regain consciousness, and then live out
a normal life span. <br>
SEVEN: As drones. <br>
EMH: As drones. But they'd be alive, Seven. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Astrometrics

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
They have no hope of surviving unless they return to the Collective. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Not exactly a happy ending, is it? <br>
SEVEN: No. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Back on that planet, why do you think you reacted so
differently from the rest of them? Why were you so afraid of becoming
an individual? <br>
SEVEN: When I was first assimilated into the Collective, I was a child.
They were assimilated as adults. When our individual memories began to
resurface<br>
CHAKOTAY: Yours were of being a little girl. A scared little girl. <br>
SEVEN: I let that fear control me. After I saw the drone die in the
swamp, I panicked. I began to envision my own death. Alone, without even
the sound of another drone to comfort me. So I forced them to return. I
infiltrated their left cerebral hemispheres with nanoprobes and created
a new interlink network. One that they couldn't resist. And then I
eliminated the evidence of what I had done. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You were overwhelmed by feelings you couldn't begin to
understand. You're not responsible for that. <br>
SEVEN: Because of what I did, they'll be forced to live the rest of
their lives in the Collective. For that, I am responsible. <br>
CHAKOTAY: There's a difference between surviving and living. They'll
survive in the Collective, but they won't really be alive. You know
that better than any of us. <br>
SEVEN: There is no alternative. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How long would they survive if the Doctor deactivated this
interlink network you created? <br>
SEVEN: A month at most. <br>
CHAKOTAY: A month as an individual, or a lifetime as a drone. Which
option would you choose? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Doctor's office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
Survival is insufficient. <br>
EMH: I beg your pardon? <br>
SEVEN: Eight years ago, I forced them to return to the Collective. I
won't make the same mistake again. They deserve to exist as
individuals. We must terminate the link between them. <br>
EMH: I understand that you feel a certain responsibility for these
patients, but as their physician, so do I. It's my duty to preserve
their lives for as long as possible, even if that means <br>
SEVEN: I will not return them to the Borg. <br>
EMH: Are you thinking of what's best for them, or for you? <br>
SEVEN: Clarify. <br>
EMH: You said it yourself. You made a mistake. And Seven of Nine
doesn't like to make mistakes. She strives for perfection. I want you
to think about the motivation behind your decision. Are you doing
what's right for those three people, or are you trying to alleviate the
guilt you feel over what happened eight years ago? <br>
SEVEN: The damage I did can never be repaired, and my guilt is
irrelevant. I simply want them to experience individuality, as I have.
As you have. At one time, you were confined to this Sickbay. Your
programme was limited to emergency medical protocols. In some ways, you
were not unlike a drone. But you were granted the opportunity to
explore your individuality. You were allowed to expand your programme.
Your mobile emitter gives you freedom of movement. Your thoughts are
your own. If you were told you had to become a drone again, I believe
you would resist. <br>
EMH: Yes. I suppose I would. <br>
SEVEN: They would resist as well. They would choose freedom, no matter
how fleeting. Only you and I can truly understand that. <br>
EMH: Survival is insufficient. </font></p>

FOUR: I had no idea you were going to say that. I don't know
what either of you is thinking. <br>
TWO: I'd forgotten what it was like to be alone with my own
thoughts. I'm leaving. <br>
THREE: Where will you go? <br>
TWO: I want to see the space station, to meet new people. To
fill my life with life again, in the time I have left. <br>(He nods a thank you to Seven, and leaves.)<br>
FOUR: I'm leaving as well. There's an uninhabited planet only a
few light&nbsp;years from here. I'd like to spend my final days in the open
air. <br>(He hugs Three, then turns to Seven.)<br>FOUR: My people don't believe in holding grudges. I wish you well, Seven of
Nine. <br>
SEVEN: Thank you. <br>(Four leaves.)<br>
THREE: It's nice to be on a Federation Starship again. I'd like
to stay aboard Voyager. <br>

you did to us, but I do understand why you did it.
