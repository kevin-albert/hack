SEVEN: Preanimate biomatter. <br>
EMH: Look deeper. <br>
SEVEN: An undeveloped nucleus contained in a cytoplasmic matrix. <br>
EMH: And buried deep inside that nucleus, primitive strands of DNA. The
beginnings of life, Seven. <br>
SEVEN: What's your point? <br>
EMH: When I look at this, I don't see a mere cell. I see the potential
for literature and art, empires and kingdoms. <br>
SEVEN: Perhaps your visual subroutines are malfunctioning. <br>
EMH: Someday, this cytoplasmic matrix may fall into the primordial sea
of a distant world where it could ignite an evolutionary process. Eons
from now, a creature not unlike you could emerge, look up at the stars
and ask, who am I? How did I come to be? It's the miracle of creation,
Seven. Doesn't that excite you? <br>(Shudder!)<br>EMH: Ensign Kim, I asked you to hold us

Where's the photonic? <br>(Seven is more animated, and her voice uses more inflections.)<br>
EMH-SEVEN: You decompiled his matrix. You murdered him.<br>
KIM: Seven? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: I'm sorry. There wasn't enough time. <br>
JARYN: Biogenic material. It could be used to create viral weapons. <br>
RANEK: Confiscate it. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Our Doctor was using these spores to synthesise new
medicines, not weapons. <br>
RANEK: What's this? <br>(Seven has the mobile emitter in her hand.)<br>
EMH-SEVEN: It's my portable regeneration unit. I have a unique
physiology. This device maintains my cybernetic systems. <br>
RANEK: Have&nbsp;this analysed. <br>
LOKIRRIM: Yes, sir. <br>
JARYN: There's no one else aboard. <br>
RANEK: Take them to detention, and secure their ship in the docking
bay. <br>
KIM: You got what you wanted. Let us go. <br>
RANEK: Transporting photonics and manufacturing biogenic weapons are
serious charges.<br>
LOKIRRIM: Let's go. </font></p>

Careful, Ensign, or you'll fracture a metacarpal.<br>
KIM: That'd be the least of our problems. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: The situation is not as desperate as it appears. <br>
KIM: Not as desperate? We're prisoners on an alien ship. Voyager has no
idea we're missing, and the Doctor's been decompiled. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: The reports of my decompilation have been greatly
exaggerated. <br>
KIM: Doc? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Please state the nature of the medical emergency. Seven
downloaded my
programme into her cybernetic matrix. An interesting sensation, to say
the least. <br>
KIM: And now you're in control of Seven's body? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Total control, it seems. <br>
KIM: What about Seven? Is she all right? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: I scanned her before the aliens came aboard.
Physiologically, she's fine. As for her consciousness, I'm assuming it's
submerged, but there's no way to be sure until I vacate her systems and
conduct a neurological exam.<br>
KIM: Then we need the mobile emitter. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: This experience will make a fascinating article for the
Starfleet medical journal. <br>(S/he touches the cell forcefield.) <br>EMH-SEVEN: Ow! <br>
KIM: Careful. That's not your body, remember? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: I know Seven's senses were more acute than the average
humanoid but, I had no idea. What is that? <br>
KIM: What? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: That smell. <br>
KIM: I don't smell anything. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: It could be an airborne toxin. Do you think they're trying
to poison us? <br>(S/he sniffs Kim.)<br>EMH-SEVEN: It's you. <br>
KIM: It's been a busy day. I guess I'm perspiring a little. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: A little? Seven's had a busy day too, and she's come through
it smelling like the proverbial rose.

quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Tuvok is trembling whilst trying to meditate. Paris is doing a medical scan.)<br>PARIS:
Headache, fever, respiratory distress, tremors. It looks like some kind of
virus. <br>
TUVOK: It is not a virus.<br>
PARIS: You want to tell me what's going on? <br>
TUVOK: In the Doctor's database, you'll find a medication under file
theta twelve alpha. Please, replicate it immediately. <br>
PARIS: You know I can't give out medicine without knowing what it's
for. <br>
TUVOK: If you must know, I am suffering from a neurochemical imbalance.
<br>
PARIS: An imbalance. <br>
TUVOK: It is native to my species. <br>
PARIS: Ah. This wouldn't be the kind of imbalance that comes around
once every seven years? <br>
TUVOK: My pon farr is in the early stages. The urges are still
controllable. <br>
PARIS: You never fail to amaze me, Tuvok. A man of your advanced years
still driven by the mating instinct? <br>
TUVOK: Unlike in humans, the Vulcan libido increases with time. <br>
PARIS: Well, I guess there has to be some kind of reward for all that
Vulcan discipline.<br>
TUVOK: The Doctor anticipated my needs and developed a treatment.
Combined with meditation, it will enable me to control the symptoms. <br>
PARIS: Well, if that doesn't work, there's always a cold sonic shower.
I'll tell the captain that you'll be out of commission for a couple of
days. <br>
TUVOK: She will want to know why. <br>
PARIS: Well, according to my tricorder, all we've got here is a mild
case of the Tarkalean flu. <br>
TUVOK: Thank you, Lieutenant. </font></p>

Mmm! I had no idea that eating was such a sensual experience. The
tastes, the textures, feeling it slide down Seven's oesophagus. It's exquisite. <br>
KIM: They're prison rations. My uniform probably tastes better. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: You know, I was thinking. When we get back to Voyager,
perhaps you and Seven could help me modify my physical parameters. <br>
KIM: Why? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: So I can eat, of course, like any other member of the crew. <br>
KIM: There's just one small problem. You don't have a stomach. Where is
the food going to go? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: I believe we can construct a holographic stomach that can
store the food for eventual recycling. <br>
KIM: Maybe we should focus on something more productive, like getting
out of here. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Relax, Ensign. Our shipmates have never let us down before.
I'm sure the captain will clear up this little misunderstanding. In the
meantime, are you going to finish that?<br>(Kim hands over his plate.)<br>
JARYN: You. Come with us. <br>
KIM: I'm the senior officer. If you're going to take someone, take me. <br>
JARYN: My orders were specific. <br>

compliments to the chef. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">LOKIRRIM:
The prisoner, sir. <br>
RANEK: Pulse-phased weapons, duranium-enforced hull. Much more
sophisticated than the typical smuggler's vessel. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: How many ways do you want me to say this? We are not
smugglers, or terrorists. We are explorers. Let us contact our ship.
Our captain will explain everything. <br>
RANEK: If you are innocent, then you won't mind telling me more about
this vessel. For instance, this device. What does it do? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: That's a standard food replicator. <br>
RANEK: Can it be used to create bioweapons? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Not unless you count Mister Neelix's Bolian soufflé. Let me
show you. Computer, one slice of New York cheesecake. This is an old
Earth delicacy. <br>
RANEK: How do I know you're not trying to poison me?<br>
EMH-SEVEN: Oh, please. <br>(S/he takes the fork and samples it. The cheesecake is even more tasty than expected.)<br>EMH-SEVEN: Mmm mmm! Oh, I never imagined. Mmm! <br>
RANEK: Is this the first time you've tried that? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Of course not, but it's just that I usually avoid foods that
are this rich. I do have a figure to maintain. Oh, I'd better get
another for you. Computer, another slice of cheesecake. Here. <br>(S/he hands the half-eaten one to Ranek. He finds it pleasurable, too.)<br>
RANEK: What other foods can that device create?<br>EMH-SEVEN: Hmm. (One banquet later, EMH-Seven is lying on the biobed. They are both drinking alcohol.)<br>EMH-SEVEN:
Oh, during my time with the Collective we assimilated thousands of
cultures from one end of the galaxy to the other. I'll say this for the
Borg, we certainly do travel. Ah, of course, my life didn't truly begin
until I came aboard Voyager, and met the person who changed my
life The only one who truly believed in me, saw my true potential. <br>
RANEK: Your Captain. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Our Doctor. That's right, the photonic. If only you could
have known him. Ruggedly handsome. A sharp wit, a towering intellect.
If he and I hadn't been colleagues. Well, now we'll never know what
heights he could have reached. <br>
RANEK: I hope you understand, I had no choice. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: I was just following orders. I've heard that before. <br>
RANEK: Maybe there's something I could do for you.&nbsp;I'll speak to
my superiors, ask for leniency. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: If I survive that long. <br>
RANEK: What do you mean? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: My cybernetic components are already depolarising. I need my
regener regeneration device. As you can see, my motor functions are
already impaired. <br>
RANEK: All right. If I give this back to you, will you do something for
me? </font></p>

It was so kind of you to escort me. Ah, nice to see you, Ensign. <br>
KIM: Are you drunk? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: It wasn't my fault. Seven's unique physiology is unique. It
doesn't react well to synthehol. <br>
KIM: What happened? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Captain Ranek and I shared a meal aboard the Flyer. He's
really a gentleman, once you get to know him. <br>
KIM: You had a dinner date in Seven's body? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: It wasn't a date. It was a tactical manoeuvre designed to
win the trust of our captors, and it worked. <br>(S/he holds up the mobile emitter.)<br>
KIM: I won't ask what you had to do to get this. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Nothing unladylike, I assure you. They lost their medic to a
recent skirmish, and I offered to take his place. <br>
KIM: Let's download your programme before they change their mind. Hey,
careful where you point those tubules. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Sorry. <br>(She injects the emitter, and the EMH appears.)<br>
KIM: Easy. How do you feel? <br>
SEVEN: Impaired. <br>(Seven is holding her upset stomach.)<br>
EMH: You've had quite a shock to your system. Let me explain what's
happened. <br>
SEVEN: I know exactly what's happened. You've been abusing my body. <br>
EMH: I'm a doctor. <br>
KIM: Shush! <br>
EMH: I would never abuse your body. I was trying to get information.
Sometimes a glass of wine can loosen the tongue. <br>
SEVEN: One glass. That doesn't excuse the other eight. <br>
EMH: Was it that many? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.<br>
KIM: Seven, you were aware of everything? <br>
SEVEN: Painfully. <br>
EMH: I'm afraid the role of spy wasn't written into my programme. I was
forced to improvise. <br>
SEVEN: You improvised your way through an entire cheesecake, as well as
three servings of Ktarian chocolate puffs. Now I have to suffer the
consequences. <br>
EMH: I apologise if I overindulged. I'll be more careful next time. <br>
SEVEN: There won't be a next time. <br>
EMH: I'll be discovered. They'll decompile my programme. <br>
KIM: Shush. I know this is difficult for you, but you're going to have
put up with it until we can get out of here. <br>
SEVEN: How do you propose we do that? <br>
KIM: Maybe you can tap into their comm. system, get a message to
Voyager. <br>
EMH: Deciphering alien computers isn't exactly my forte. <br>
SEVEN: But it is one of mine. If you can get close enough while they're
accessing their systems, I'll be able to observe their command
protocols. <br>
LOKIRRIM [OC]: What's the situation? <br>
JARYN: The Captain wants the female prisoner in the medical bay. <br>
SEVEN: We should proceed. <br>
EMH: You're saving my life. I want you to know how grateful I am. <br>
SEVEN: Try to remember that the next time you're tempted to
overindulge.<br>(She re-assimilates his programme.)

The photonic's viral weapon attacks the cerebral cortex. Within days,
the victim suffers complete synaptic failure. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Well, if we can't stop the virus, we may be able to slow its
progress. We need to
synthesise a neural inhibitor. Forgive me, but aren't you the ship's
tactical officer? <br>
JARYN: Tactical officer, medic, engineer. We've lost nearly a third of
our crew to the photonics. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: You certainly know your way around a medical bay. You
may have missed your true calling. <br>
JARYN: Actually, Emmik always thought I'd become a teacher. He used to
call me the little professor. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Who's Emmik? <br>
JARYN: The photonic who helped raise my brother and me. He knew more
about treating scrapes and bruises than any organic Doctor I ever met. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Sounds like someone I'd enjoy meeting. <br>
JARYN: Maybe. Before he joined the insurgency. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Why did he do that? <br>
JARYN: I ask myself that question every day. We never treated him like
a servant, but he turned against us anyway. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Is it possible he felt subjugated? <br>
JARYN: I don't see how. He lived his own life, pursued his own
interests. He was part of our family. At least I thought he was. We
should get back to the patient. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: It could take up to a day to determine if the inhibitor is
working. <br>
JARYN: Thank you. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Don't thank me, thank my ship's doctor. He taught me
everything I know about medicine. And remember, he was a photonic.
Actually, you have a lot in common with him. He was something of a
Jack of all trades, too. I suspect you'd have gotten along famously.
I'm certain he would've taken a liking to you.

EMH-SEVEN: Oh, I promised a friend I'd go easy on the synthehol. Do you
hear that? It's identical to the rhythm produced by the eight-chambered
Ktarian heart. <br>
RANEK: Is something wrong? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Rapid pulse, respiratory distress. You may be having a
reaction to the pulsar's radiation. We should get you to the medical
bay. <br>
RANEK: No, I'm not going to the medical bay. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: You starship captains are all alike. You can stare down the
barrel of a phaser cannon but you can't stomach a simple medical exam. <br>
RANEK: I don't need an exam to know what I'm suffering from. <br>(He&nbsp;kisses
her. S/he pushes him away forcefully.) <br>RANEK: I'm sorry. I thought. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: You were wrong.<br>
RANEK: I didn't mean to offend you. It's just I've never met a woman
like you before. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: That's because there are no women like me.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JARYN:
Is something wrong? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Ranek summoned me to the bridge under the pretext of a
little stargazing. What he really wanted was to use my face as a tongue
depressor. <br>
JARYN: I'm surprised to hear that. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: It was completely inappropriate. That kind of behaviour
would get a Starfleet captain reassigned to a garbage scow.<br>
JARYN: I'm not defending what he did, but you have to understand we've
been out here for a long time. It's difficult to hide your feelings
especially when you work closely with someone you're attracted to. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: You have, have feelings for him? I've known lotharios like
Ranek. Trust me, you don't want anything to do with him. You need
someone who, who can appreciate your many talents. Someone overflowing
with intelligence and compassion, someone capable. Ow! <br>(EMH-Seven pulls a neck muscle.)<br>
JARYN: It looks like a spasm in the trapezius. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: I had no idea it could be so excruciating. <br>
JARYN: That's what happens when you work so long without rest. Our last
medic showed me a technique that might help. I, I'll try it, if you
like. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Please, anything. <br>(Jaryn massages her shoulders.) <br>EMH-SEVEN: Oh, that, that feels
wonderful. <br>(S/he suddenly moves away.) <br>
JARYN: Oh, did I hurt you?<br>
EMH-SEVEN: No, no, no, no, no, no. <br>
JARYN: Well then, what's wrong? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: There's something you don't know about me. Something I have
to tell you. <br>
JARYN: It's all right. I know.<br>
EMH-SEVEN: You do? How could you?<br>
JARYN: Your cybernetic implants? Your portable regenerator? <br>
EMH-SEVEN: You're not going to tell anyone, are you? <br>
JARYN: I would never say anything to the crew. But Ranek knows. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: He does?<br>
JARYN: Of course. It was apparent the moment we scanned you. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: I can't believe you didn't say anything. <br>
JARYN: It wouldn't have been appropriate. You're part Borg. It's
nothing to be ashamed of. <br>

seizure before the guard would let me see you. <br>
EMH-SEVEN: Calm down. Seven and I have been making progress. <br>(The EMH is downloaded into the mobile emitter.)<br>
KIM: Did you get a look at their computer? <br>
SEVEN: During the one brief moment when the Doctor wasn't indulging
himself. <br>
EMH: I think I've shown considerable restraint, under the circumstances.
<br>
SEVEN: Kissing Ranek on the bridge. Is that your idea of restraint? <br>
KIM: Kissing? <br>
EMH: Not that it's any of your business, but if you must know Ranek
kissed me.<br>
SEVEN: And the massage you got from Lieutenant Jaryn? <br>
EMH: Entirely therapeutic.<br>
SEVEN: You became sexually aroused in my body. <br>
EMH: When did it become a crime to enjoy a sensation or two? Of course,
you'd be the last person to understand that. <br>
SEVEN: What do you mean? <br>
EMH: The whole world is full of experiences and sensations, but you
insist on denying yourself. Instead of replicating caviar, you choose
nutritional supplement thirteen alpha. <br>
SEVEN: Caviar is an indulgence. <br>
EMH: Indulgences are what make life worth living. <br>
KIM: Shush. <br>
EMH: These last few days have been a revelation. Feeling your lungs
fill with air, the surge of adrenaline through your veins. Until I
spent a day in your skin, I never knew what I was missing. <br>
SEVEN: You may have been better off not knowing. <br>
EMH: We're quite a pair. Me trapped by the limitations of photons and
forcefields, you by a drone's obsession with efficiency. You'd make an
excellent hologram. <br>
KIM: All right, listen. You can argue all you want when we get back to
Voyager, but that's not going to happen unless we come up with a plan.
Did you learn anything about their comm. system? <br>
SEVEN: It can only be accessed from the bridge, but I saw Ranek enter
his command codes. <br>
KIM: If we can get those codes to Voyager, they may be able to disable
the shields and beam us out. <br>
EMH: How are we going to do that? <br>
SEVEN: The subspace transceiver on the Flyer. <br>
KIM: Can you get aboard? <br>

dereliction of duty. My illness is still in the early stages. I can

Tarkalean Flu was seven years ago. As soon as this is over, the holodeck

really ought to be in bed. This is my grandmother's recipe, guaranteed
to cure even the most stubborn flu. Now, Smell that? <br>
TUVOK: I don't smell anything. <br>
NEELIX: Exactly. I prepared it just the way you like it. No herbs or
spices of any kind. It's practically tasteless. <br>
