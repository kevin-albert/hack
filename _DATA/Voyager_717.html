waiting for the light. Then, a single photon flares into existence,
then another, and soon thousands more. Optronic pathways connect,
subroutines emerge from the chaos, and a holographic consciousness is
born. (To illustrate this, an image of the EMH is built up bit by bit. He is wearing a satin smoking jacket. Very Noel Coward.)<br>EMH [OC]:&nbsp;I awaken into this world fully programmed yet completely

Francisco? <br>
ADMIRAL PARIS [on screen]: Cold and rainy as usual. <br>
JANEWAY: It sounds delightful. Lieutenant Barclay, my congratulations
on establishing the first trans-galactic comm. link. You've earned a
place in the history books. <br>
BARCLAY [on screen]: I can't take all of the credit, Captain. It was
Harry and Seven who suggested bouncing a tachyon beam off of the
quantum singularity. <br>
KIM: Just be sure to thank us when you accept the Daystrom prize. <br>
ADMIRAL PARIS [on screen]: I wish we had more time for small talk but
the singularity only stays in alignment for eleven minutes a day. <br>
JANEWAY: Eleven minutes are better than none, Admiral. We appreciate
all your work, Reg. <br>

determine how to allocate the comm. time. <br>

gift for you and your crew. (Their image shrinks into the bottom right corner of the screen, to reveal planet Earth.)<br>

too much cloud cover over North America today. <br>

a difficult choice. <br>(Red alert. Something goes bang. Paris steps out of the office.)<br>

PARIS: Please state the nature of the medical emergency. <br>
CREWMAN: Our doctor's dead. We've got wounded. They're both badly hurt.
Who should we treat first? <br>
PARIS: Second degree plasma burns. He's got an aortic rupture. Get him
to the surgical bay now. (A hunky Bajoran man with a long pony tail and
tattoo over his cheek, helps an injured person in. The tattoo
incorporates a snake and a Bajoran symbol.)<br>

the others first. <br>

treat him now. <br>

first. So, if you'll excuse me <br>(Katanay puts up a forcefield to stop him.)<br>

you're Torrey and I am Lieutenant Marseilles. <br>TORRES: Oh, now that's creative. <br>

PARIS: He thinks he's written a masterpiece. I didn't know what to tell
him. <br>
KIM: If this gets distributed, people are going to assume this is about
us. What are our families going to think? <br>
TORRES: This is a Starfleet ship. No one will believe we actually go
around shooting injured crewmen. <br>
PARIS: People may not take the programme literally, but they might
wonder if there's some truth to it. I think we should talk to the captain. <br>

you any further similarities are purely coincidental. <br>

EMH: What would you have me write about? Palace intrigue on the Klingon

EMH: No! The Vortex characters are larger than life. They're nothing

EMH: The emitter in my story is nothing like the real one. <br>

small shuttlecraft. <br>
EMH: It's a metaphor. A symbol of the burdens that I live with every
day. Imagine having to take this everywhere you go. It would be a
constant reminder that you're different from everyone else. I wanted
the player to feel the weight of it. Literally. <br>

someone who feels oppressed. Is that how you see yourself, Doctor? <br>

TORRES: Brothers? <br>
EMH: Hundreds of EMH mark ones. Identical to me in every respect
except, they've been condemned to a menial existence. Scrubbing
conduits, mining dilithium. There's a long history of writers drawing
attention to the plight of the oppressed. The Vedek's Song, for example
tells the story of the occupation of Bajor. <br>

should consider how it's going to make your friends feel. <br>
