RIKER: There's an object of some kind closing in on our position. <br>
PICARD: On screen. <br>
DATA: It appears to be an unmanned probe approximately one half metre
in diameter. There are no identifiable armaments. <br>
WORF: Captain, we are being, You are being hailed, by name. <br>
PICARD: Open a channel. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard <br>
WORF: Captain, I am reading a power surge. <br>
RIKER: Shields up. <br>
DATA: The beam appears to contain holographic imaging information. <br>
RIKER: It's trying to project something. <br>
PICARD: Isolate the bandwidth. Let the signal through the shields. <br>
(the image of a Ferengi appears) <br>
PICARD: Bok! <br>
BOK: I trust you remember me, Picard, because I haven't forgotten you
or how you murdered my son. For fifteen years now I've thought about
how to avenge his death but nothing I could do to you could equal what
you did to me, until now. You thought you could hide him from me,
didn't you? But I found out about him. Jason Vigo is as good as dead.
I'm going to kill your son, Picard, just like you killed mine. <br>
(hologram ends) <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, put a tractor beam on that probe. Determine if
it's safe to beam it aboard. I want to know where it came from. Mister
Data, see if there is any mention of a Jason Vigo in Federation
records. You might start with Miranda Vigo. She was born on New Gaul
about fifty years ago. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Number One, contact the Ferengi Government. Find out all you
can about Bok. He was wearing a DaiMon's uniform. If he's regained his
rank, I want to know why.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Come. <br>
RIKER: The Ferengi Government is debating an amendment to the Rules of
Acquisition. It could be a while before we hear from them. Data found
out that the woman you mentioned has a son named Jason. This is the
most recent picture we could find. <br>
PICARD: How old is the boy now? <br>
RIKER: Twenty three. He and his mother left Earth twelve years ago.
They settled on Camor Five. That's all we know. The planet's records
are virtually non-existent. <br>
PICARD: Picard to Bridge. Set a course for the Camor system, warp five.
<br>
HELM [OC]: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Will, I do appreciate your not asking, but I do think that you
have a right to know. There is a possibility that the boy is my son. I
was involved with his mother for a short time about twenty four years
ago. We met through a friend when I was on shore leave on Earth. It was
all very romantic, very intense, probably because we both knew I would
be leaving in two weeks. And we kept in touch for a while, but we never
managed to get together again. <br>
RIKER: She never said anything to you about being pregnant? <br>
PICARD: No, so either Bok is wrong and I'm not the father, or Miranda
decided to raise the child alone, which quite frankly wouldn't surprise
me. She was very independent, very strong willed. <br>
RIKER: She would have to be to get by on Camor Five. <br>
PICARD: But whether he's my son or not, he's in danger. Bok tried to
kill me six years ago, and I don't doubt he will try to make good his
threat against the boy.

RIKER: Anything? <br>
WORF: There are no Ferengi vessels within range of our scanners. <br>
DATA: Captain, I am unable to find any information on Jason Vigo's
current whereabouts. <br>
PICARD: What about his mother? <br>
DATA: No, sir. <br>
PICARD: Miranda was trained as a botanist. She always used to talk
about running a farm one day. Maybe we should concentrate on the
agricultural areas. <br>
DATA: That would significantly narrow our search. The only cultivated
land is on the southern continent, and there are relatively few people
engaged in agricultural activities. <br>
PICARD: There cannot be many non-Camorites among them. Scan for human
life signs. <br>
DATA: I am detecting eight humans. Three are female. However, they are
all too young to be Miranda Vigo. <br>
PICARD: What about males? <br>
DATA: One is an infant. Another is elderly. Two are middle aged. <br>
PICARD: That's seven. You said there were eight. <br>
DATA: I am having difficulty getting a clear reading on the eighth. The
individual appears to be approximately two kilometres beneath the
planet's surface. <br>
PICARD: Male or female? <br>
DATA: Male, between twenty and thirty years old. <br>
RIKER: No one in their right mind would go that far underground alone. <br>
PICARD: Unless he were forced to. <br>
WORF: Captain, I am reading seismic instability in the area. He is in
danger. <br>

JASON: I realise I wasn't supposed to be spelunking that cave, but
don't you have something better to do? <br>

JASON: Oh. Well, I wasn't, so maybe you should just beam me back where
I was? <br>
PICARD: Are you Jason Vigo? <br>
JASON: I, er, I know him. Is he in trouble? <br>
PICARD: In a manner of speaking. Someone has made a threat against his
life. Jason, I'm an old friend of your mother's. I'm here because
you're in danger. <br>
JASON: Why would anybody want to kill me? <br>
PICARD: The person who has made the threat is under the impression that
you are my son. <br>
JASON: Am I? <br>
PICARD: I don't know. <br>
JASON: My mother never told me who my father was. Just that he was in
Starfleet. <br>
PICARD: Maybe we should contact her. <br>
JASON: She died a few years ago. <br>
PICARD: Oh, I'm sorry. Jason, I think it's important that we find out
one way or another. Would you be willing to permit a genetic test? <br>
JASON: If I'm not your son, is this person still going to want to kill
me? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JASON: What's all this? <br>
PICARD: Oh, theses are archaeological fragments that I've collected
over the years. This is a Silvan glyph stone. And
this, this is a Gorlan prayer stick. It's really quite rare. <br>
JASON: Is it valuable? <br>
PICARD: Not really. Only to students of archaeology such as myself.
Though I did have to hand over a bottle of very old Saurian brandy for
it. <br>
JASON: I'd say you got taken. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps, but it's of value to me nonetheless. <br>
JASON: On Camor, something has value if you can eat it or sell it.
Everything else is luxury. <br>
PICARD: Would you like some tea? <br>
JASON: No. Thanks. <br>
PICARD: Something else? <br>
JASON: No. <br>
PICARD: Tea, Earl Grey, hot. I'm sure this whole thing is as much a
surprise to you as it is to me. I really want to be honest with you,
Jason. I only knew your mother for a very short time. I would have
liked to have known her better. It just didn't work out that way. You
look a lot like her, you know. It's the eyes, I think. I would like to
make one thing clear, Jason. Your mother never told me about you. If
she had, I would have been part of your life. <br>
JASON: Maybe that's not what she wanted. I think I'd like to go back to
the surface now. <br>
PICARD: I think it would be better if you stayed on board the
Enterprise until we have resolved this situation with Bok. <br>
JASON: What is the situation with Bok, anyway? Why does he want me
dead? <br>
PICARD: Years ago, I was forced to destroy a starship commanded by his
son. Bok apparently feels that it would be fitting vengeance to kill my
son. <br>
JASON: I can't hide forever. <br>
PICARD: Of course not. We are trying to locate Bok now. I want to
confront him, settle this matter. <br>
JASON: How long is this going to take? <br>
PICARD: I assure you there is no one more eager to put this behind us
than I am. <br>
JASON: Where do I stay? <br>
PICARD: We'll get you some quarters. <br>
JASON: Okay. Let's go. <br>

get to know each other. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: We managed to shut down the probe's power
systems so we could beam it aboard. It's not going to be easy to figure
out where this thing came from. <br>
DATA: Bok took the precaution of encrypting the probe's navigational
systems so that we would be unable to decipher its flight path. <br>
LAFORGE: We ran an analysis of the probe's hull. From the energy
signatures and particle deposits we found, it looks like it travelled
through a dichromic nebula, was exposed to an intensive gravimetric
distortion, and passed within one light year of a class four pulsar. <br>
DATA: Those phenomena are relatively common. We would need to identify
at least one of them specifically in order to postulate a flight path. <br>
PICARD: Understood. <br>
DATA: Captain, incoming message from DaiMon Birta. <br>
PICARD: Put it on screen. Thank you for taking the time to talk to us,
DaiMon. <br>
BIRTA [on viewscreen]: I understand you have a problem. <br>
PICARD: Yes, it concerns DaiMon Bok. <br>
BIRTA [on viewscreen]: Bok is no DaiMon. He was relieved of command six
years ago. He was unstable, dangerous. We had to confine him to Rog
Prison. <br>
PICARD: But he's no longer there? <br>
BIRTA [on viewscreen]: He was able to buy himself out about two years
ago. <br>
PICARD: I see. Do you know his whereabouts now? <br>
BIRTA [on viewscreen]: I understand he was seen in the Dorias cluster
not too long ago. <br>
PICARD: But that cluster consists of more than twenty star systems. <br>
BIRTA [on viewscreen]: You don't have to thank me, Captain. <br>
(transmission ends) <br>
LAFORGE: Believe it or not, Captain, that might've given us the fix we
needed. There's a nebula in the Dorias cluster that matches the same
particle signature we found on the probe. <br>
DATA: There is a class four pulsar three light years from the nebula.
My calculations indicate the probe was launched in the Xendi Kabu
system. <br>
PICARD: Plot a course. Take us out of orbit.

CRUSHER: Keep in mind he's had twenty years to be angry that his father
wasn't there. It's going to take some time to get over those feelings.
But I do think it's possible. <br>

sense is that he's a very independent young man. Perhaps it would be
best if I left him alone. Let him come to me if he wants to. <br>

technology was found to be unreliable, as well as energy intensive. <br>
LAFORGE: In order to transport matter through subspace, you have to put
it into a state of quantum flux. It's very unstable. <br>
PICARD: What range would that kind of transporter have? <br>
DATA: In theory it could operate over several light years. <br>
LAFORGE: That means that the probe that exploded could have been beamed
into position from some point outside sensor range. <br>
DATA: If Bok uses his transporter again, we might be able to trace the
subspace signature and locate his ship. <br>
PICARD: Is there any way we can keep Bok from beaming aboard the
Enterprise again? <br>
LAFORGE: I don't think there is. <br>
PICARD: If he has the ability to beam aboard, he may be able to beam
someone away. <br>
DATA: It is a possibility. <br>
PICARD: I'm concerned that he may try to take Jason. Is there any way
we can protect him? <br>
LAFORGE: You know, we might be able to keep a signal lock on him at all
times. If Bok tries to beam him away, we might be able to hold him
here. <br>
DATA: In order to do so, we would need to tie the ship's subspace field
coils into the transporter system. <br>
PICARD: Make it so. Computer, where is Jason Vigo? <br>
COMPUTER: Jason Vigo is in holodeck four. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Jason is climbing without equipment) <br>
PICARD: (to security) Would you wait outside? <br>
(Rhodes and her companion leave, then Picard climbs to join Jason on a
ledge) <br>
JASON: Not bad. <br>
PICARD: I like climbing. There's something about actually having your
fate in your own hands. <br>
JASON: Yeah, I know. <br>
PICARD: It looks as though we may have found out how to locate Bok's
ship. This could all soon be over. <br>
JASON: You came all the way up here just to tell me that? <br>
PICARD: I thought it would make you feel better. <br>
JASON: Thanks. That was nice of you. <br>
PICARD: Jason, when your mother and I parted, I lost track of her
completely. But I would like to know more about what happened to her,
if you wouldn't mind telling me. <br>
JASON: Like what? <br>
PICARD: Well, how did you end up on Camor? It's an unlikely place for a
woman and child. <br>
JASON: Well, you know how she was. See a stray cat, take it in. See
somebody cold, give them your coat. <br>
PICARD: Yes, that was Miranda, all right. <br>
JASON: She heard about the all children on Camor who'd been orphaned
from the Cardassian war. <br>
PICARD: Oh. I see. <br>
JASON: I was only ten when we went there. I remember her telling me all
about the boys and girls who didn't have anybody to take care of them.
So she got this big house, practically falling apart, then she started
rounding up children. Eventually, there were over forty of us there.
She called it a school. You know, she got up before dawn every day and
went to bed well after midnight. In between she never stopped working.
She taught us all how to read. And she grew vegetables in hardpan to
feed us. And she made sure we knew how to sing. It's important in a
place like Camor. And then one day she was attacked by two men in the
street in broad daylight for the food she was carrying. If she'd just
given it to them, they probably wouldn't have hurt her. But she knew
how important the food was to us. So they killed her. <br>
PICARD: I'm so sorry. <br>
JASON: Don't be sorry for me. My mother made sure that we were all
tough enough to make it. <br>
PICARD: Jason, isn't there some way that I can be a father to you? My
own father and I were estranged. He wanted me to stay home and tend the
vineyards and I wanted to join Starfleet. And he died before we could
come to terms with that. And I've regretted that all of my life. I
don't want the same thing to happen to you and me. <br>
JASON: You don't understand. I'm not anybody you'd want for a son.
Trust me, if you knew anything about me, you wouldn't be trying so
hard. <br>
PICARD: You're so wrong. <br>
JASON: Oh, really? Let me spell it out for you. I've been in trouble
since I was a teenager. I lie, I steal, I use people. I'm a criminal.
That's what your son is. <br>
PICARD: I know. <br>
JASON: You do? <br>
PICARD: Oh, yes, I know all about your troubles with the Camor
authorities. <br>
JASON: You do. <br>
PICARD: It doesn't make any difference, Jason. You're still my son.
And, like it or not, I'm your father. I don't know what that means, but
it means something. There's some connection. <br>
JASON: Yeah. <br>
PICARD: But one thing is clear. You'll never look at your hairline
again in the same way. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Have you been able to locate Bok's ship? <br>
DATA: No, sir. The subspace signature left by his transporter is
decaying more rapidly than predicted. It may not be possible to trace
it. <br>
WORF: Captain, another probe has materialised five hundred kilometres
to starboard. It is sending a transmission. <br>
PICARD: Put it on screen. <br>
BOK [on viewscreen]: This is a very special day, Picard. Fifteen years
ago you took my son away from me. Today, I will take your son away from
you. It will be our anniversary. I wanted you to see him one last time.
<br>

minutes. <br>

we could use a subspace transport from here to get me onto Bok's ship? <br>

see how we're going to get you back. <br>

BOK: What kind of deal? <br>
JASON: Tell my father you killed me. Put a phaser burn on my shirt and
send it to him. He'll think I'm dead. That's what this is about, isn't
it? I got friends on Camor Five that will make it worth your while. <br>
BOK: I understand your desire to live, but I want Picard to see your
body so there will be no doubt. <br>
(Picard beams in) <br>
PICARD: Lower your weapons or Bok is dead. <br>
BOK: Lower yours or your son dies. <br>
PICARD: You know as well as I do, Bok, he's not my son. I know what
you've done. Miranda Vigo is his mother but I am not his father. You
made it appear so because you resequenced his DNA. But your technique
was flawed. He developed a neurological disorder. When my ship's Doctor
investigated it, she discovered what you had done. <br>
TOL: Now he'll never pay the ransom. <br>
BOK: Shut up. <br>
PICARD: There never was a ransom. All he was ever interested in was
vengeance. <br>
TOL: DaiMon, is this true? <br>
PICARD: He's not a DaiMon. He was stripped of command. <br>
BOK: They had no right to do that to me. <br>
PICARD: He lied to you so that you would help him in his plan. The
Enterprise is closing in on your position. If you let the two of us go,
they won't attack you. <br>
BOK: They won't attack us with you on board. <br>
PICARD: They will cripple your vessel and keep you here until the
Ferengi authorities arrive. You've got a lot deal of explaining to do.
Your only hope is to turn Bok over to them and tell them that he
deceived you. <br>
