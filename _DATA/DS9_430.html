<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: You wanted to see me, Commander? <br>
SISKO: Actually, what I'd like to see is next month's duty roster. <br>
KIRA: You'll have it on your desk first thing in the morning. <br>
SISKO: That's what you said yesterday. <br>
KIRA: I know, but I just spent the whole day yesterday <br>
SISKO: Talking to Minister Rozahn about irrigating the Trilar
Peninsula. <br>
KIRA: How did you know? <br>
SISKO: It's hard to keep a secret in Ops, especially when you've been
shouting at a monitor for the last two days. <br>
KIRA: I thought I kept it down to an angry whisper. <br>
SISKO: Let's just say that your voice carries. <br>
KIRA: Every time I talk to one of the ministers I promise myself I'm
not going to lose control. But then they give me some stupid
bureaucratic excuse for why something isn't getting done, and I get so,
so <br>
SISKO: Frustrated. <br>
KIRA: Oh Commander, I am way beyond frustrated. Bajor is in trouble. I
just want to help. <br>
SISKO: I can understand that, and I sympathise. As far as I'm concerned
you can shout at the provisional government all you want to, as long as
it doesn't interfere with your duties here on the station. <br>
KIRA: You're right. I'll get on that report right away. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Ops]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: Major, Quark's been looking for you. He
says it's urgent. <br>
KIRA: Perfect.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The clientele are captivated by a Bajoran playing
a variation on the DS9 theme on a wooden wind instrument. Even the
waiters are caught up in the mood.) <br>
KIRA: I hear you've been trying to get in touch with me. <br>
QUARK: You hear right. Look around you. Does anything seem to be amiss?
<br>
KIRA: The sonata Varani is playing is lovely. Your customers seem to be
enjoying him. <br>
QUARK: Why be modest, Major? They're not just enjoying him. They're
mesmerized by him. <br>
KIRA: So? <br>
QUARK: So while they're being mesmerized, they're not gambling, they're
not eating, they're barely drinking. Profits are down across the board.
<br>
KIRA: He just started yesterday. <br>
QUARK: I monitor my gross income hourly. My hourly figures become my
indicators. My indicators become my projections. And my projections
based on the last twenty six hours show an unprecedented decline in
profits. <br>
KIRA: Stop overreacting. When people hear about how wonderful Varani
is, they'll come beating down your door. <br>
QUARK: What are you basing that projection on? Bajoran intuition? That
and a strip of latinum will get you a couple of spins at the dabo
wheel. <br>
KIRA: You promised me you will try him out for a month. <br>
QUARK: If my projections hold true, in a month I'll be out of business!
<br>
KIRA: Quark, you are going to do this. <br>
QUARK: Why should I? <br>
KIRA: Because I asked you to. <br>
QUARK: Maybe he could play something with a little more bounce to it. <br>
KIRA: Bounce? <br>
QUARK: For a change of pace. <br>
(Varani finishes his piece) <br>
KIRA: That was beautiful. <br>
VARANI: Having my work appreciated again, I've almost forgotten how it
feels. <br>
KIRA: Granted, it's not quite the exhibition halls you're used to. <br>
VARANI: One can't be choosy about performance venues these days. <br>
KIRA: I just spoke with Quark. He likes what you're doing but he's
hoping you'll play a variety of styles. <br>
VARANI: A little less exhibition hall and a little more music hall, is
that it? <br>
KIRA: Something like that. <br>
VARANI: I think I can accommodate him. <br>
GIRL [OC]: Dabo! <br>
MAN [OC]: That's great. <br>
KIRA: I'd love to hear you play in a more appropriate setting. <br>
VARANI: Have you spoken to Minister Bolka about my idea to rebuild the
Jalanda Forum? <br>
KIRA: I mentioned it to him. He's got a lot on his mind. <br>
VARANI: You must keep trying. Bajorans must reclaim their artistic
heritage if they ever hope to regain their sense of self-worth. <br>
KIRA: Next time I talk to the Minister I'll bring it up again, but I
can't promise anything. </font></p>

Quark? <br>
KIRA: That little toad is this far from doing a three sixty out an
airlock. <br>
SISKO: I'm glad to hear everything went okay. <br>
O'BRIEN: Commander, sensors are picking up elevated neutrino readings.
A ship's coming through the wormhole. <br>
SISKO: On screen. <br>
KIRA: Sensors are detecting four lifeforms on board. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm reading a plasma leak in their engine core. <br>
SISKO: Hail them. <br>
KIRA: No response. <br>
O'BRIEN: The reactor's overheating. Life support is barely functioning.
<br>
SISKO: Get them out of there, Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. <br>
(A female and three males are beamed in. They have very dry, flaking
skin.) <br>
SISKO: I'm Commander Sisko of the United Federation of Planets. You've
just been beamed onto a Bajoran space station. We don't mean you any
harm. We're going to bring your ship in. Once it's docked, we'll
diagnose its problems and hopefully fix them. After that, you can be on
your way. I can offer you medical assistance for that wound <br>
TUMAK: (the injured boy) Oo-mata! Oo-mata! Dongo patar meeoto fenta.
Fenta! <br>
HANEEK: (woman) Naga dentana. Dentana. Oobay a-tal? Oobay a-tal.
Keetama sootay. Shalanta Skrreea. Skrreea. <br>
KIRA: Does anyone understand what she's saying? <br>
SISKO: Something must be wrong with the Universal Translator. Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: It's working, Commander, but for some reason it's having a
hard analyzing their language patterns. Their syntax and their
grammatical structure must be completely unlike anything in our
database. <br>
SISKO: We'll have to keep them talking until the computer can establish
a translation matrix. <br>
HANEEK: Ketoh maseeca Skrreea. Tolak mayfessaka. Koo masek. Gadoux
besoolin fenta. Fenta? <br>
KIRA: Keeping them talking shouldn't be much of a problem. <br>
HANEEK: Oobay-a-tal? Fidask setoma meeka? <br>
SISKO: Major, we've got to get them down to the Infirmary. They seem to
be most comfortable with you. Why don't you lead the way? <br>
KIRA: All right. We're going to take a little ride in the turbolift. <br>
HANEEK: Toma. Bessa. <br>
(They follow Kira) <br>
SISKO: Sisko to Odo. <br>
ODO [OC]: Yes, Commander. <br>
SISKO: We're bringing some new arrivals from the Gamma Quadrant down to
the Promenade. Meet us at turbolift nine. <br>
ODO [OC]: I'm on my way.

need to be afraid. Come on, it's all right. <br>
ODO: What seems to be the trouble, Commander? <br>
SISKO: The computer's having a hard time translating their language. <br>
ODO: I can see how that would be a problem. <br>
KIRA: It's okay. Come on. <br>
(The boys start straying to explore) <br>
ODO: Hold on, let's stick together. No wandering off. You just stay put

ODO: I'm afraid you'll have to put that back. <br>
TUMAK: Vala. Vala! <br>
HANEEK: Intaowa! <br>
KIRA: Do you like it? <br>
ODO: Yes, it's very nice but it's not yours. <br>

ODO: And that goes for you, too. <br>
SISKO: Major, perhaps you'd better handle this. <br>
KIRA: All right, let's put those back, both of you. They really need to
put those back. We can go shopping later, but right now it's very
important that we go to the Infirmary, so everyone follow me. We'll all
go together. <br>

BASHIR: Looks like a second degree plasma burn. The dermal regenerator

involve themselves in situations like this. <br>
DAX: Are all your leaders women? <br>
HANEEK: Yes. <br>
BASHIR: All of them? <br>
DAX: You heard her, Julian. <br>
HANEEK: Men are much too emotional to be leaders. They're always
fighting among themselves. It's their favourite thing to do. I'm sorry.
I hope I haven't offended anyone. <br>
(Sisko enters from his office) <br>
SISKO: Sorry to keep you waiting. <br>
DAX: That's all right, Benjamin. Haneek was just telling us how the
Skrreea are a female dominant society. <br>
O'BRIEN: It seems the men are a bit too emotional to become leaders. <br>
HANEEK: Please do not misunderstand. We love our men. Really. <br>
SISKO: Are you one of the leaders of your people, Haneek? <br>
HANEEK: Me? Oh, no. I'm little more than a farmer. I was just lucky. <br>
BASHIR: How so? <br>
HANEEK: I was the first one to find the Eye of the Universe. <br>
DAX: You were looking for the wormhole? <br>
HANEEK: We had heard about a great tunnel being discovered. We knew it
must be the Eye of the Universe that would lead us to Kentanna. <br>
O'BRIEN: Kentanna? <br>
HANEEK: Kentanna is the legendary home of the Skrreeans. It has always
been portrayed in our sacred texts as being just beyond the Eye of the
Universe. A planet of sorrow where the Skrreean will sow seeds of joy. <br>
SISKO: I can't guarantee you'll find Kentanna, but I can promise you
that we'll help you find a home. <br>
We've sent our runabouts to the Gamma Quadrant to make contact with
your ships. <br>
HANEEK: That will be difficult. They're spread out, looking for the
Eye. <br>
ODO: And when we find them, what then? This station only holds seven
thousand people. You're talking about three million Skrreeans. <br>
KIRA: I'm afraid most of your people will have to stay confined to
their ships. <br>
HANEEK: I understand. <br>
SISKO: In the meantime, is there any one person we should be looking
for? A leader or leaders? <br>
HANEEK: Most of our leaders were killed by the T-Rogorans. <br>
BASHIR: The T-Rogorans? Who are they? <br>
HANEEK: For eight centuries my people have lived under their rule.
We've been forced to work as labourers and servants. We were able to
escape when the T-Rogorans were invaded and conquered. <br>
ODO: Who conquered them? <br>
HANEEK: I don't know their name. I only know they were members of
something called the Dominion. </font></p>

HANEEK: Hus-bands? I'm not familiar with that word. They're bonded to
me. <br>
KIRA: Do you sleep with them both? <br>
HANEEK: Of course. Don't you sleep with your males? <br>
KIRA: No, I don't have any males. Not at the moment, anyway. <br>
HANEEK: They're very useful. <br>
KIRA: Yes, I can imagine they are. I just wanted to tell you we found
some of your ships. Several hundred Skrreeans should be arriving at the
station today. We thought it would be a good idea if you were there to
meet them. <br>
HANEEK: Why me? <br>
KIRA: You yourself said most of your leaders were dead. <br>
HANEEK: Yes, that's true, but Kira, I'm just a farmer. <br>
KIRA: You also were the first one through the Eye of the Universe.
That's got to mean something, in some symbolic sort of way. Oh, here.
(hands a package to Haneek) I brought you something. Go ahead, open it.

KIRA: Oh, not at all. Haneek, this is Varani, a great musician. Maybe
the greatest Bajor has ever known. <br>
VARANI: She exaggerates, but that's why I'm so fond of her. Being a
Bajoran, I know what it's like to be displaced. As a token of
friendship, I would like to give you this. <br>

NOG: About what? <br>
JAKE: About you getting in trouble with Odo. <br>
NOG: He was very angry. <br>
JAKE: He was? <br>
NOG: He always gets angry when I get caught. <br>
(Tumak and co are coming towards them. Nog does a 180) <br>
NOG: I just remembered. I have some errands to run for my uncle. <br>
JAKE: You're going to have to face them sooner or later. <br>
TUMAK: That was very funny, what you did. <br>
NOG: You see, Jake? There's a man with a sense of humour. <br>
TUMAK: Nobody's laughing. <br>
JAKE: And luckily nobody got hurt. I think my friend's real sorry for
what he did. Aren't you? <br>
NOG: I suppose. <br>
JAKE: See? What did I tell you? <br>
TUMAK: He doesn't sound sorry to me. <br>

while the other two flatten Nog, who screams. Quark hears it from his
upper level cafe and comes over) <br>
NOG: I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! <br>
QUARK: All right, that's enough. Break it up. I said, break it up! <br>
(Tumak goes for Quark but backs off when Quark hisses at him) <br>
QUARK: It's bad enough you're all hanging around the station without
buying anything. You have to start fighting, too? <br>
TUMAK: I thought we were welcome here. <br>
QUARK: Well make yourselves welcome somewhere else. <br>
TUMAK: You don't want us here. You don't want anything to do with us.
We don't want anything to do with you. Any of you! <br>

Two would make a perfect home for the Skrreea. <br>
KIRA: Draylon Two? Never heard of it. <br>
DAX: It's near Sefalla Prime. It's got definite possibilities. Stable
orbit, temperate climate, and very low surface radiation. <br>
SISKO: Add to that good soil and a long growing season. I think it's
our best bet.

SISKO: I understand. We have some encouraging news. <br>
KIRA: We think we've found a planet for you and your people, one with
excellent potential for resettlement. <br>
HANEEK: We appreciate all your hard work, but I'm afraid it was
unnecessary. You see, we've found Kentanna. <br>
KIRA: You did? <br>
HANEEK: A planet of sorrow, Kira. Don't you see? Kentanna is your
planet. Kentanna is Bajor.

will be there as well. <br>
KIRA: That's right. <br>
VARANI: Please tell her my heart goes out to her and her people. Tell
her how much Bajorans everywhere regret having to refuse their request.
<br>
KIRA: Aren't you being a little premature? <br>
VARANI: Am I? You know what the provisional government's answer is
going to be. <br>
KIRA: These are people who've lost everything, Varani. <br>
VARANI: I know, and I wish there was some way we could help them. But
Bajor is in shambles, Kira. You know that as well as I do. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROZAHN: (a woman) First of all, I want you all to
know that the provisional government has taken the Skrreeans' request
for immigration very seriously. The debate in the Chamber of Ministers
became quite heated at times. Though I suppose you could say that about
all of our debates. <br>
SISKO: But a decision was reached? <br>
ROZAHN: Yes. I was sent here to tell you that the Ministers in accord
with the Vedek Assembly have decided to deny the Skrreeans' request. I
am sorry. <br>
SORAD: Bajor simply cannot absorb three million refugees at this time. <br>
ROZAHN: After what the Cardassians did to our planet, we can barely
take care of our own. <br>
HANEEK: But no one is asking you to take care of us. <br>
SORAD: This decision is not based strictly on Bajoran self-interest.
Such a huge increase in population would prove to be tragic to your
people as well as ours. <br>
HANEEK: But Bajor has more than enough room for us. The plains of the
northwest peninsula are practically uninhabited. The land's ideal for
farming. <br>
ROZAHN: It used to be, before the Cardassians got their hands on it. <br>
HANEEK: Minister Rozahn, the Skrreeans are farmers. Just give us the
land. I guarantee you we can make it thrive again. <br>
ROZAHN: Under ideal circumstances, perhaps you could. But what if the
circumstances aren't ideal? What if we go through another long winter?
What if your crops fail? What if the famine that has been plaguing
Bajor continues to spread? What then? <br>
HANEEK: We're willing to take that risk. <br>
ROZAHN: I'm afraid we aren't. We ran a series of projections to see
whether a Skrreean settlement could survive on the northwest peninsula.
The results were not encouraging. <br>
SISKO: Haneek, I think you should seriously consider Draylon Two as an
alternate to Bajor. The winters are mild, there's plenty of good
farmland. <br>
HANEEK: No! Projections can be wrong. <br>
SORAD: But what if they're not? What is Bajor to do if your people
start dying? <br>
HANEEK: I thought I made that clear. We are not expecting your help. <br>
ROZAHN: Do you really think we could stand by and do nothing? We would
feel obligated to help with food, with clothing, with whatever it would
take. <br>
SORAD: And where would that aid come from? Our resources are already
depleted. To help you would mean depriving our own people. <br>
ROZAHN: I'm afraid the decision of the provisional government is final.
The Skrreea will have to find somewhere else to live. <br>
HANEEK: (to Kira) Please, talk to them. Tell them they're wrong. Help
us. <br>
KIRA: I can't. I'm sorry, Haneek, but they're right. I wish they
weren't. I wish Bajor was Kentanna, but it's not. <br>

the right decision, for both Bajor and the Skrreeans. <br>

tractor him in. <br>

O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. <br>

leave immediately. <br>
KIRA: Open a channel. This is Major Kira Nerys on Deep Space Nine. The
Skrreean vessel has refused to acknowledge our hails. Communications
may be down. You have to let them land. <br>
PILOT [OC]: That's impossible, Major we have strict orders not to allow
any Skrreean vessel to land. <br>
KIRA: The pilot's just a boy. He took the ship without permission It's
barely operational. We're not sure he'll make it back here. <br>

emergency. I want to speak with him now. <br>

SISKO: On screen. <br>
HAZAR [on viewscreen]: What is this about, Commander? <br>
SISKO: It's about the Skrreean vessel that's approaching Bajor. <br>
HAZAR [on viewscreen]: I've already given the order to have it turned
back. <br>
SISKO: That ship is being flown by a child and it's leaking radiation. <br>

we could have made that peninsula bloom again. We'll never know, will
