city built on the usual grid system with travel tubes in mid air, a

OBRIST:
Temporal incursion is complete. All organisms and man-made objects have
been eradicated. <br>
ANNORAX: Probe the continuum. Has our target event been achieved? <br>
OBRIST: Negative. Negative target event. I don't understand, sir. We
spent months making these calculations. <br>
ANNORAX: Time is patient, so we must be patient with it. Eradicating a
single Zahl colony wasn't enough for a total restoration. We have to
work on a larger scale. Take us to the Zahl homeworld. Prepare a new
set of calculations. We must erase the entire species from time. Every
lifeform, every molecule. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Space, the great unknown, Only now we're going to know it a
little better. Harry? <br>
(An image of our galaxy from above is divided into grids. Note to the
interested, the long wig has finally been discarded and Janeway has
Kate Mulgrew's natural shorter length hair.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Before there were maps and globes, let alone radar and
subspace sensors, mariners navigated by the stars. We're returning to
that tried and true method, but this time there's a difference. <br>
JANEWAY: Ensign Kim and Seven of Nine have merged Starfleet and Borg
ingenuity to create this new technology.And I'm sure I speak for the
entire crew when I say, thank you. Now, how the hell does it work? <br>
SEVEN: Astrometric sensors measure the radiative flux of up to three
billion stars simultaneously. The computer then calculates our position
relative to the centre of the galaxy. <br>
KIM: This mapping technology is ten times more accurate than what we've
been using. Seven, will you do the honours? We've plotted a new course
home. <br>
SEVEN: By my estimates this trajectory will eliminate five years from
your journey. <br>
NEELIX: Our journey. Nice work, Seven. <br>
TORRES: That region of space we're about to enter. It looks like it has
a lot of M-class planets. <br>
SEVEN: It does. Spatial grid zero zero five. Primary species, the Zahl.
<br>
TUVOK: What do we know about this species? <br>
SEVEN: Technologically advanced but nonconfrontational. Their
resistance quotient is quite low. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Thank you all for coming. We've got a lot of work to do, so <br>
EMH: I'd like to say a few words if I may. I've prepared a speech for
this occasion. When I was first activated on Stardate 48315, and I
found myself mano a mano with the Delta Quadrant, I didn't think we'd
survive a week, let alone three years. There was strife. There was
discord. You were all at each others throats. But over time, I've had
the pleasure and pride of watching this crew learn to work together as
colleagues, even friends. <br>
PARIS: Hear, hear. <br>
EMH: Who would have thought that this eclectic group of voyagers could
actually become a family? Starfleet, Maquis, Klingon, Talaxian,
hologram, Borg, even Mister Paris. Granted, we've had our share of
difficulties. One might say, we've seen the best of times and the worst
of times. I'd now like to recount some of those times from my unique
perspective. Under the category of best of times, I invite you all to
recall the moment when I <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: Bridge to captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Janeway here. <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: We're being hailed. A vessel off the port bow. <br>
CHAKOTAY: On our way. <br>
EMH: Perhaps we could all reconvene later? </font></p>

They're firing on us, Captain. <br>
TUVOK: It's a small vessel, fifteen lifeforms aboard. Low warp
capacity, limited armaments. They pose no threat. <br>
JANEWAY: Open a channel. Good day, sir. Have we offended you in some
way? <br>
KRENIM COMMANDANT [on viewscreen]: You will reverse course immediately.
This region is in dispute. You have no business in Krenim space. <br>
JANEWAY: I was under the impression we were entering Zahl territory. <br>
KRENIM COMMANDANT [on viewscreen]: The Zahl have no legitimate claim
here. They have taken what is ours. Reverse course or be destroyed. <br>
JANEWAY: With all due respect, unless you've got something a little
bigger in your torpedo tubes, I'm not turning around. But I'm certainly
willing to discuss this issue with you. <br>
KRENIM COMMANDANT [on viewscreen]: No discussion! No compromise! <br>
(Transmission ends.)<br>
TUVOK: They are in retreat. <br>
CHAKOTAY: His bark's obviously worse than his bite. <br>
JANEWAY: He seems rather intent. Let's go to yellow alert. Maintain our
course. Maybe the Zahl can give us some answers. </font></p>

their severe uniforms, the Zahl go for a more casual look.)<br>
ZAHL
OFFICIAL: As long as you travel in Zahl territory you travel among
friends. I apologise for your mishap with the Krenim. <br>
JANEWAY: It was hardly traumatic, but I am curious. The Krenim claim
this region as their own. <br>
ZAHL OFFICIAL: The Krenim dominated this space many years ago. They
possessed deadly weapons based on temporal science, and it kept them in
power for a long time. But a generation ago we fought the Krenim. We
defeated them and took back the planets that they had annexed,
dismantled their military forces. Their ships still wander our
territory making grandiose claims. Don't let them trouble you. Now,
tell me about Voyager. A single ship alone, half a galaxy from home.
How exciting for you. <br>
KIM [OC]: Bridge to Captain. Sorry to interrupt, but the Krenim vessel
is back. They're demanding to speak with you. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Hello again. <br>
KRENIM COMMANDANT [on viewscreen]: You've ignored our warnings, and now
you consort with our enemy. <br>
ZAHL OFFICIAL: Leave this space or I'll seize your vessel and send you
home in a cargo container. <br>
JANEWAY: Gentlemen, please. Believe me, we're not conspiring against
you. <br>
KIM: Captain, there's a spatial distortion heading towards us. Whatever
it is, it's huge. Five light years across and it's expanding. <br>
TUVOK: Tracking it's origin. A vessel near the Zahl homeworld. <br>
ZAHL OFFICIAL: What? <br>
TUVOK: It appears to be a massive build-up of temporal energy. Some
kind of space-time shock wave. <br>
JANEWAY: Tom. <br>
PARIS: It's destabilising our warp field. I've lost engines. <br>
JANEWAY: Shields to full. Secure primary systems. All hands, brace for
impact.<br>
(The shock wave makes the Zahl ships vanish and the small Krenim ship
turns into a big battle cruiser. As it passes through Voyager, the Zahl
official disappears and Ms Lang is lying on the deck.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: She's dead. <br>
TUVOK: Shields at seventy percent. The Krenim are firing again. We're
being hailed. <br>
JANEWAY: It's about time. On screen. We've done nothing to provoke
these attacks. <br>
KRENIM COMMANDANT [on viewscreen]: Your presence in our space is
provocation enough. <br>
JANEWAY: We've been trying to communicate with your vessels but the
only answer I get is weapons fire. <br>
KRENIM COMMANDANT [on viewscreen]: State your identity. <br>
JANEWAY: Captain Janeway of the Federation starship Voyager. <br>
KRENIM COMMANDANT [on viewscreen]: And your reason for violating our
borders? <br>
JANEWAY: We're simply trying to get home. If you'd kindly allow us to
pass through <br>
KRENIM COMMANDANT [on viewscreen]: No. You will submit to the Krenim
Imperium. I would prefer to seize your vessel before it is too badly
damaged. Surrender now and I will forego the execution of your crew. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't respond well to threats. <br>
KRENIM COMMANDANT [on viewscreen]: Then prepare to be boarded. <br>
(Transmission ends.)<br>
JANEWAY: All hands, battle stations. This is turning into the Week of
Hell. <br>
TUVOK: They are charging weapons. Three seconds to impact. <br>
JANEWAY: Evasive manoeuvres. <br>
KIM: Direct hit to our secondary hull. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I still don't understand why these torpedoes are ripping
right through our shields. <br>
TUVOK: Their weapons are chronoton based. They're penetrating our
shields because they're in a state of temporal flux. <br>
JANEWAY: Then lets exercise the better part of valour. Get us out of
here, warp six. <br>
PARIS: Warp six. No sign of pursuit. <br>
JANEWAY: Damage report. <br>
TUVOK: Fifteen wounded. Main power is down. We've lost environmental
control on decks seven and eight. The computer is offline. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Kim, do we have any sensors left? <br>
KIM: Short range only. <br>
JANEWAY: Commander, put the ship on twenty four hour tactical alert.
Tuvok, analyse whatever data we've got on those chronoton torpedoes.
See if you can modify our shielding. When those Krenim attack again, I
want to be ready. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Annorax
is studing a small object held in a clear pyramid.) <br>
ANNORAX: Enter. <br>
OBRIST: Sir, you were correct. The Zahl homeworld was the focal point.
Its erasure has produced a complete temporal restoration. <br>
ANNORAX: Complete? <br>
OBRIST: Yes, sir. <br>
ANNORAX: If I told you to count the stars in the cosmos would the task
ever be complete? <br>
OBRIST: Sir? <br>
ANNORAX: Our attempts may be sufficient. They may be even relatively
successful, but they will never be complete. Choose your words with
more precision. <br>
OBRIST: My apologies. <br>
ANNORAX: What were the exact results? <br>
OBRIST: The Krenim Imperium has been restored to power. Our territory
now includes eight hundred and forty nine inhabited worlds spanning
five thousand parsecs. <br>
ANNORAX: Counter indications? <br>
OBRIST: Negligible. No superior enemy forces, no unexpected
diseases. Calculations indicate a ninety eight percent restoration. Our
race is thriving once again. <br>
ANNORAX: The, er, the colony at Kyana Prime. That was restored as well?
<br>
OBRIST: No, sir. In this timeline the Imperium does not extend that
far. <br>
(Annorax puts down the pyramid.)<br>
ANNORAX: Then our mission has failed. Begin calculations for the next
incursion. <br>
OBRIST: Sir, we have just accomplished the impossible. A ninety eight
percent restoration. Another incursion, even a minor one, could
undermine everything. We should dismantle this weapon and rejoin our
people. <br>
ANNORAX: No, not until every colony, every individual, every blade of
grass is restored. <br>
OBRIST: You said yourself our task will never be complete. Please. We
should be satisfied with what we have accomplished. For two hundred
years, we have never come this close. <br>
ANNORAX: Not close enough. <br>
OBRIST: If I may speak my thoughts. Many among the crew are convinced
that you have lost your objectivity. They think your quest for
precision is unrealistic. Sir, we will never restore one hundred
percent of what we had. We can manipulate the time continuum for
another ten centuries. It will never happen. <br>
ANNORAX: Return to your station and begin a new set of calculations. Is
that clear? <br>
OBRIST: Perfectly. <br>
ANNORAX: You surprise me, Obrist, After so many years, you still
perceive time through conventional eyes. Never is a word that has no
meaning here. As long as we stay on this vessel, protected from
space-time, we have all eternity to accomplish our mission. <br>

CHAKOTAY: I'll be blunt. Our strategy is failing. It was a good idea to
try and create temporal shielding but it isn't working. <br>

information about their chronoton weapons. <br>

JANEWAY: We don't have a choice. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe we do. <br>
JANEWAY: Here comes the part I'm not going to like. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We should consider leaving the ship behind, breaking the crew
into smaller groups. Escape pods, shuttles, each one with its own
course. If all goes well, we'll rendezvous on the other side of Krenim
space. <br>
JANEWAY: Then what? <br>
CHAKOTAY: We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. But at least we'd
be increasing our chances of survival. <br>
JANEWAY: Abandon ship? The answer's no. I'm not breaking up the family,
Chakotay. We're stronger as a team. One crew, one ship. The moment we
split apart, we lose the ability to pool our talents. We become
vulnerable. We'll get picked off one by one. Now I say we make our
stand. Together. <br>
CHAKOTAY: To be honest, I wasn't too fond of the idea myself. <br>
JANEWAY: As long as Voyager's in one piece, we stay. <br>

this go? <br>

Captain's log, stardate 51268.4. This morning's attack destroyed the
power grid on deck eleven. No casualties this time, but the replicator
system was badly damaged. We've gone to emergency rations. As a result,
the situation has gotten a little worse. Environmental controls
continue to fail. Seven decks have been rendered uninhabitable and
we've had to relocate the crew. Quarters are close, nerves are frayed,
and I'm not sure what's more difficult to maintain. Voyager's systems
or the crew's morale. What's important is that we're together, working
toward a single goal. Survival. </font></p>

back into open space, find allies, put together a fighting force to
take on Annorax. We're leaving this damn cloud first thing tomorrow

CHAKOTAY: Component 37329, a rogue comet. About eight months ago,
Voyager made a course correction to avoid the comet. According to my
calculations, it led to our entering Krenim space. <br>
ANNORAX: The solution, then, would be to erase that comet from
history. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Exactly. Voyager would have stayed on its course and bypassed
Krenim space altogether. <br>
ANNORAX: Sounds simple enough. Conduct a simulation. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Temporal incursion in progress. What happened? <br>
ANNORAX: Had you actually eradicated that comet, all life within fifty
light years would never have existed. Congratulations, You almost wiped
out eight thousand civilisations. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I didn't consider the entire history of the comet. <br>
ANNORAX: Four billion years ago, fragments from that comet impacted a
planet. Hydrocarbons from those fragments gave rise to several species
of plant life, which in turn sustained more complex organisms.
Ultimately several space-faring civilisations evolved and colonised the
entire sector. <br>
CHAKOTAY: By erasing the comet I altered all evolution in this region. <br>
ANNORAX: Past, present and future. They exist as one. They breathe
together. You're not the only person to make this mistake. When I first
constructed this weapon ship, I turned it against our greatest enemy,
the Rilnar. The result was miraculous. With the Rilnar gone from
history, my people, in an instant, became powerful again. But there
were problems. A rare disease broke out among our colonies. Within a
year, fifty million were dead. I had failed to realise that the Rilnar
had introduced a crucial antibody into the Krenim genome, and my weapon
had eliminated that antibody as well. <br>
CHAKOTAY: And you've been trying to undo that damage ever since. But
each time you pull out a new thread, another one begins to unravel. <br>
ANNORAX: You can't imagine the burden of memory that I carry. Thousands
of worlds, billions of lives, gone, brought back, gone again. I try to
rationalise the loss. They're not really being destroyed, because they
never existed. Sometimes I can almost convince myself. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You've been at this for two hundred years, Annorax. What
makes you think you're ever going to succeed? <br>
ANNORAX: What makes you think Voyager will ever reach Earth? The odds
against you are astronomical, yet you keep trying. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You're right. But we don't destroy everything that stands in
our way. <br>
ANNORAX: You can help me to change that, Chakotay. Together, we'll
restore the Krenim and Voyager and we'll undo the damage that I've
caused. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I've still got a lot to learn. <br>

temporal core. </font></p>

You're deactivating the temporal core. <br>
OBRIST: I'm sorry, sir. It's over. <br>(Obrist beams Chakotay and Paris away.)<br>
ANNORAX: Get back to your stations. You will not disobey me. We're
phasing back into normal space-time. Reconfigure to conventional
weapons. </font></p>

their temporal core before he left. I'm transmitting them to you now. </font></p>

ANNORAX: Fire at will.<br>(A
damaged cruiser crashes into Voyager. Fires break out everywhere and
Janeway is knocked across the deck. She crawls back to the Captain's
chair. There is a big hole where the viewscreen used to be, and only a
forcefield between her and a close view of Annorax' ship.)<br>
OBRIST: Sir, weapons are back to full capacity. <br>

JANEWAY: Negative. Torpedo launchers are down. I'm setting a collision
course. Janeway to the fleet. Take your temporal shields offline. <br>
TUVOK [OC]: Captain, we won't be protected. <br>
JANEWAY: Exactly. If that ship is destroyed all of history might be
restored. And this is one year I'd like to forget. Time's up.<br>(Voyager ploughs into its mortal enemy with a big KaBOOM!) </font></p>

incursion within the ship.<br>(The

then the Time ship explodes and implodes. Now that's how to press a big

JANEWAY: When can you bring it online? <br>
SEVEN: We just did. <br>
KIM: In fact, we're in the process of charting a new course home. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, I'd say this is cause for celebration. <br>
TUVOK: A vessel is approaching off the port bow, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. <br>
KIM: They're hailing us. <br>
JANEWAY: Open a channel. <br>
KRENIM COMMANDANT [on viewscreen]: You've entered Krenim space. State
your identity. <br>
JANEWAY: Captain Janeway of the starship Voyager. We're just passing
through, trying to get home. <br>
KRENIM COMMANDANT [on viewscreen]: This region is in dispute. I suggest
you avoid our territory. <br>
JANEWAY: Thanks for the warning. <br>
KRENIM COMMANDANT [on viewscreen]: Good journey. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tom, plot a course around Krenim space. <br>
PARIS: Aye, sir. <br>
CHAKOTAY: So, what do you think? How about a ground-breaking ceremony for
our new lab? <br>
KIM: Sounds great. <br>
JANEWAY: I think I'll replicate a bottle of Saint Emillion for the
occasion. 2370. I hear that was a good year. </font></p>
