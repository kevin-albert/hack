necessary contact with the Jarada, a reclusive, insect-like race known
for its idiosyncratic attitude towards protocol. The Jarada demand a
precise greeting, in this case from Captain Picard. Their language is
most unusual. The slightest mispronunciation is regarded as an insult. </font>

woman kissed me, it was so <br>
CRUSHER: Exciting? <br>
PICARD: Real. The subject of this meeting is the Jaradan rendezvous.
Mister Riker, will you go ahead with the briefing. <br>
RIKER: This is primarily a diplomatic mission. The Jaradan are
strategically important to the Federation. Previous attempts have
failed because they are so easily irritated. A slip in the
pronunciation of the greeting caused a twenty year rift. <br>
TROI: The Captain has to recite the entire greeting without making any
mistakes. <br>

DATA: Yes. If, on the other hand, the Captain makes even the slightest
error <br>

come in contact with the Jaradan. It graphically demonstrates what

WORF: Aye, sir. Standard orbit. <br>
RIKER: Riker to Holodeck. <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: Nothing yet, Commander. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: It's no use. It's just not there. <br>
PICARD: Suggestions, Mister Data? <br>
DATA: I am at a loss, sir. We are in a holodeck-created building of
1941. The computer refuses to accept voice commands. The controls for
the environment are, therefore, not accessible. <br>
CRUSHER: I could use some light. <br>
(Data carries a standard lamp over, and is baffled when it goes out
because the plug has come out of the wall. Picard plugs it in nearer
the patient) <br>
(Leech returns with a gunman and a fat man) <br>
REDBLOCK: Good day, Mister Hill. My name is Cyrus Redblock. I hope you
don't mind us dropping in. <br>
(A very poor, skinny version of Sydney Greenstreet) <br>
PICARD: I see I have no choice. <br>
REDBLOCK: Life is an endless stream of choices. Unfortunately, you have
chosen to make my life more difficult. I don't suppose you'd be foolish
enough to hide it here. <br>
PICARD: I don't suppose so. <br>
REDBLOCK: Still, I'm sure you won't mind if we take a look around. <br>
CRUSHER: I wish you'd quit asking, since it's obvious you're going to
do it anyway. It's just a waste of time. <br>
REDBLOCK: Good manners, Madam, are never a waste of time. Civility,
gentlemen, always civility. Get that stiff out of here. <br>
CRUSHER: He's not dead. <br>
REDBLOCK: From his pallor, he soon will be. <br>
THUG: You want I should throw him in the garbage, boss? <br>
REDBLOCK: The room next door will be good enough for now. <br>
PICARD: Don't touch him. <br>
REDBLOCK: Which one struck you? <br>
LEECH: It was Hill. <br>
(Leech pistol-whips Picard) <br>
REDBLOCK: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. A
Newtonian truism which you have obviously neglected. <br>
MCNARY [OC]: Dix, you in there? <br>
(The Thug greets the policeman and takes the bottle of drink away from
him, then his gun) <br>
MCNARY: I saw your light, figured you were working late. Guess I was
right. Nice company you're keeping, Dix. You forget to take the trash
out this morning? <br>
(That earns him a punch in the solar plexus) <br>
REDBLOCK: I'm a tolerant man, but I do not tolerate disrespect. <br>
DATA: Your devotion to etiquette is highly admirable, sir. However,
your methods leave much to be desired. <br>
REDBLOCK: What have we here? <br>
LEECH: Looks like a ghost. <br>
REDBLOCK: Yeah. Where do you suppose he's from? <br>
LEECH: Where were you hatched, anyway? <br>
DATA: I was created on a planet <br>
PICARD: Data. <br>
DATA: South America. <br>
REDBLOCK: I've been all over this world and I've never seen anything
like you. <br>
PICARD: He's not from this world. None of us are. We are from a world,
we're from a world of fabulous riches. A world where there are objects
far greater than the one you seek. <br>
LEECH: That's ridiculous! You're a private dick. We've met before and
you never even mentioned any of this. <br>
MCNARY: He's right, Dix. That's pretty weak stuff. I wouldn't even buy
that line of guff. <br>
PICARD: I am not Dixon Hill. I just look like Dixon Hill. <br>
DATA: He speaks the truth, sir. From your point of view, he is only a
facsimile, a knock-off, a cheap imitation. <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. <br>
DATA: Sorry sir, that did not come out quite the way I intended. <br>
REDBLOCK: Very, very, good. What wonderful fiction. Quite entertaining.
I admire your skill at trying to obfuscate our sense of reality. <br>
DATA: It is you who are not real, sir. <br>
PICARD: Data. <br>
DATA: It is you who are imaginary characters derived from a work of
fiction. <br>
MCNARY: Give it up, fellas. These guys are too smart to fall for that
story. <br>
DATA: I am afraid you are not real either, Lieutenant. <br>
LEECH: I don't want to hear any more of this. You're making me crazy.
Let me shoot them, Mister Redblock. Let me kill them, one by one. <br>
REDBLOCK: What an interesting situation. Perhaps we should test this
theory by killing one of them. <br>
CRUSHER: You've already done that. This man is dying. This whole thing
is senseless. <br>
REDBLOCK: Hardly. Senseless killing is immoral. But killing for a
purpose can be quite often ingenious. <br>
LEECH: Well said, Mister Redblock. What is our purpose? <br>
REDBLOCK: We are on a quest for knowledge, Mister Leech. We want the
item. <br>
PICARD: We don't have it. <br>
LEECH: Shall I kill him? <br>
REDBLOCK: No, kill the woman. <br>
PICARD: Redblock. I have the item. <br>
REDBLOCK: At last. I knew it. God, man, you are a character you are.
Waiting until the last moment, testing my resolve. All right, where is
it? <br>
PICARD: I'll explain. But first, tell Leech to back off. <br>
REDBLOCK: Put the gun down, Mister Leech. <br>
LEECH: But I so much want to kill her. <br>
REDBLOCK: Maybe later. It won't harm us to listen to Mister Hill. <br>
MCNARY: Don't make any deals with that slime, Dix! <br>
(The Thug knocks him down again) <br>
REDBLOCK: All right, let's begin. Make your thoughts fruitful and your
words eloquent. Because I don't have to tell you your lovely lady
friend's life depends upon it. <br>
PICARD: There is a price. <br>
REDBLOCK: By God, I knew you were a man of stripe. All right, what is
it? <br>
PICARD: Mister Whalen's life. You must help us to save him.

(Wesley does something, and the office briefly turns into an arctic
snowstorm) <br>
CRUSHER: Captain, the exit. <br>
PICARD: That's it. The way into our world. <br>
REDBLOCK: Remarkable. Is this a two-way passage? Can one enter your
world and return to this one simply by stepping through? <br>
PICARD: Oh, yes. Allow us to help Mister Whalen, and we will return
with the item. <br>
REDBLOCK: You really are a scamp, aren't you. Do you actually think I'd
stay here <br>
DATA: If you were going to go through yourself, sir, that is not
possible. <br>
REDBLOCK: One look at you, sir, is proof that anything is possible.
Step back, Mister Hill. I'd shoot you myself, but I don't want to
deprive my assistant of his greatest pleasure. After we've gone, kill
them all. Make sure the bodies are never found. <br>
MCNARY: You're insane. You think you can kill a cop and get away with
