BASHIR: He's a little disoriented. <br>
SISKO: I'm Captain Benjamin Sisko. You're aboard a Federation Space
Station near Bajor. This is Kira Nerys, my First Officer. <br>
KIRA: Who are you? <br>
AKOREM: I am the Emissary. <br>
(After the credits) <br>
AKOREM: I was headed back to Bajor. My lightship was caught in an ion
storm. It nearly tore it apart. A girder came loose from the bulkhead
and impaled me through the shoulder here. I remember thinking I was
going to die, alone in space, when a strange opening appeared in the
sky. I was terrified at first, and then I realised what was happening.
The Prophets were opening the gates of the Celestial Temple and drawing
me to them. <br>
SISKO: What happened then? <br>
AKOREM: It's difficult to describe. They took the form of people that I
know, my grandfather, my brother, so that they could communicate with
me. <br>
SISKO: You spoke to them? <br>
AKOREM: I didn't have to. I could sense their understanding, their
grace. I've never felt such bliss. And then they healed me. A light
washed over me and then my wound was gone. They gave me back my life. I
felt reborn. <br>
SISKO: When exactly did you leave Bajor? <br>
AKOREM: Oh, it couldn't have been more than a few days ago. <br>
SISKO: What was the year? <br>
AKOREM: Ninety one seventy four. <br>
KIRA: That was over two hundred years ago. <br>
AKOREM: Two hundred years? My wife, my parents, they're gone. <br>
BASHIR: If you give us your name, maybe we can contact your
descendants, let them know you're alive. <br>
AKOREM: Akorem. Akorem Laan. But I have no descendants. My brother died
last winter and my wife and I never had children. <br>
KIRA: Akorem Laan, the poet? <br>
AKOREM: I'm a poet, yes. <br>
KIRA: You wrote Kitara's Song and The Call of the Prophets. <br>
AKOREM: You know my work? <br>
KIRA: You're considered one of the greatest poets of Bajor. Every
schoolchild can recite Gaudaal's Lament from memory. <br>
AKOREM: People still read my work after all this time? Perhaps that's
part of the Prophets' plan for me. <br>
SISKO: Their plan? <br>
AKOREM: It's not clear to me yet why they made me their Emissary, but I
know that they gave me back my life for a reason. <br>
SISKO: Akorem, a great deal has happened since you've been gone. Maybe
Major Kira can spend some time filling you in. <br>
AKOREM: Major Kira? <br>
KIRA: That's right. <br>
AKOREM: But your family would be part of the artist D'jarra. <br>
BASHIR: D'jarra? <br>
KIRA: Bajor used to have a strict caste system. A person's work was
dictated by what family they were born into. <br>
AKOREM: You no longer follow your D'jarras? <br>
KIRA: When the Cardassians occupied Bajor we gave up the D'jarras so
that we could fight them. We all became soldiers. <br>
AKOREM: The Cardassians occupied Bajor? <br>
KIRA: For over fifty years. <br>
AKOREM: It seems you're right, Captain. A great deal has happened since
I've been gone.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: If you look at the prophecies about the
Emissary, a lot of them make more sense with Akorem in the picture. <br>
DAX: Really? <br>
SISKO: Every text I've read says the Prophets will name their Emissary
by calling him to them, that he would find the Celestial Temple, that
there the Prophets would give him back his life. <br>
DAX: Go on. <br>
SISKO: They didn't give me back my life. <br>
DAX: Not literally, but they did help you get your life back together. <br>
SISKO: True enough. But I wasn't the first one to find the wormhole, or
to meet the Prophets. Akorem was. <br>
DAX: Benjamin, I thought you didn't believe in the prophecies. <br>
SISKO: I don't. <br>
DAX: Then why are you using them to justify giving up your position? <br>
SISKO: I guess I was looking for something to convince me that I was
making the right decision. <br>
DAX: So your mind's made up. You're going to step aside. <br>
SISKO: Akorem will make a far better Emissary than I ever was. He's
Bajoran, he's a revered poet, and he wants the job. Besides, Starfleet
will be thrilled. They never liked the idea that the Bajorans saw me as
a religious figure. <br>
DAX: How do you know the Bajorans will accept Akorem as their new
Emissary? <br>
SISKO: I talked to Vedek Porta. He seemed to think that as long as I
make it clear that I'm stepping aside voluntarily, they will. <br>
DAX: So you're off the hook. How does it feel? <br>
SISKO: It feels good. No more ceremonies to attend, no more blessings
to give, no more prophecies to fulfill. I'm just a Starfleet officer
again. All I have to worry about are the Klingons, the Dominion and the
Maquis. I feel like I'm on vacation.

O'BRIEN: The thing is, Julian, now that Molly's a little older, I was
hoping to being able to spend some time with Keiko again. I thought we
could, I don't know, go out at night. Don't get me wrong, I know once
I'm hold my little baby in my arms I'll be the happiest man in the

KIRA: The Emissary's first public appearance? I wouldn't miss it. <br>
ODO: I'm surprised to hear you call him that. <br>
KIRA: Why? Akorem Laan was, is a great man. He's been with the Prophets
for over two hundred years, and now they've sent him back to us. <br>
ODO: Yes, but two days ago you believed Captain Sisko was the Emissary.
<br>
KIRA: Well, he made it clear he wants to step aside. <br>
ODO: Does that mean he never really was the Emissary? <br>
KIRA: No. <br>
ODO: But they can't both be. <br>
KIRA: I don't know. What do you want from me, Odo? <br>
ODO: Forgive me, Major, I don't mean to be difficult, but your faith

ODO: I don't understand. <br>
KIRA: That's the thing about faith. If you don't have it, you can't
understand it, and if you do, no explanation is necessary. <br>
(Akorem and Porta come out of the Temple below, to a lectern set up for
the occasion.) <br>

myself the same questions over and over again. Why did they keep me

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AKOREM [on monitor} People now? I now know the
answers. Bajor suffered a great wound while I was with the Prophets.
The Cardassian occupation. The Bajor I have returned to has lost its
way. People no longer follow the path the Prophets have laid out for
them. They no longer follow their D'jarras. Artists have become
soldiers. Priests have become merchants. Farmers have become
politicians. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AKOREM: We must heal the wounds of the occupation.
We must return to our D'jarras. We must reclaim what we were and follow
the path the Prophets have laid out for us. It is their will that the
farmers return to their land, painters to their canvasses, priests to
their temples. If we do this, if we follow our D'jarras, then Bajor
will flourish again and become the green and peaceful land I remember.
It will be as if the occupation never happened. By returning to our
D'jarras, we will have erased it forever. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: I wanted to talk to you before you left for
Bajor. <br>
AKOREM: Of course. <br>
SISKO: I was surprised by your speech. I had no idea you were going to
advocate change on such a massive scale. <br>
AKOREM: It's what the Prophets want for Bajor. It's why they sent me. <br>
SISKO: Are you sure of that? <br>
AKOREM: Absolutely. <br>
PORTA: The Emissary knows that what he's proposing will be difficult
for some people to accept. He doesn't expect things to change
overnight. <br>
SISKO: So, you're going to ask First Minister Shakaar to step down and
go back to farming? <br>
AKOREM: No, of course not. But, frankly, by the next election, I doubt
very many people will left on Bajor who would elect a farmer to
political office. <br>
PORTA: We hope that eventually the people will support enforcement of
the D'jarras by legal sanction. <br>
SISKO: So if someone defies their caste? <br>
AKOREM: Society will have appropriate remedies at it's disposal, such
as deportation. <br>
SISKO: You realise that caste-based discrimination goes against the
Federation charter. If Bajor returns to the D'jarra system, I have no
doubt that its petition to join the Federation will be rejected. <br>
AKOREM: Kai Winn and I have already discussed it. We're willing to make
that sacrifice in order to follow the will of the Prophets. <br>
SISKO: I had a feeling Winn would see it that way. <br>
PORTA: Well, the Emissary's transport leaves shortly. <br>
SISKO: As a Starfleet Officer, I am bound by oath not to interfere with
Bajoran affairs. But, as a friend to Bajor, I have to say giving up
Federation membership would be a mistake. <br>

the Emissary, and why Winn fears you. Goodbye, Captain. <br>

to get used to being called sir by my friends who were still ensigns. <br>
KIRA: That's different. You'd earned the right to be treated with
respect. I haven't done anything. <br>
SISKO: Sounds like you have some reservations about bringing back the
D'jarras. <br>
KIRA: I have some questions, sure. The Emissary is asking something
very difficult of us, but we have to have faith that he's guiding us
toward something. <br>
SISKO: Even if what he's guiding you towards doesn't include the
Federation? <br>
KIRA: It's not our place to question the Emissary. <br>
SISKO: No matter what? <br>
KIRA: Maybe you never realised this, Captain, but we would've tried to
do whatever you asked of us when you were Emissary, no matter how
difficult it seemed. I'd better get to Ops.

improving performance. Less mistakes due to fatigue. <br>
SISKO: Fine, let's make the change permanent. Anything else? <br>
KIRA: I was wondering if in the next few days you would have the time
to meet with Major Jatarn. <br>
SISKO: Sure. <br>
KIRA: Is something wrong, sir? <br>
SISKO: I'm sorry. I just received a communiqué from Starfleet Command
responding to my report on the Bajoran situation. <br>
KIRA: That bad? <br>
SISKO: Not yet. But I can read between the lines. I was sent here to
help bring Bajor into the Federation. That doesn't look like much of a
possibility anymore. As far as Starfleet is concerned, I have failed my
mission. <br>
KIRA: That's not fair. It's not your fault. <br>
SISKO: It is from where they're sitting. The irony is Starfleet was
always trying to get me to distance myself from this Emissary business.
And now that I have <br>
KIRA: Maybe I could talk to First Minister Shakaar about sending
Starfleet a communiqué
explaining <br>

I did fail. <br>
KIRA: Sir. <br>
SISKO: Anyway, why did you want me to meet Jatarn? <br>
KIRA: We can talk about that another time. <br>
SISKO: What is it, Major? <br>
KIRA: I think he'd make an excellent First Officer. As soon as you find
someone to take my post, I'm going to resign my commission. <br>
SISKO: To follow your D'jarra. <br>
KIRA: I'm planning to move back to the Dahkur province, There are a lot
of artists who live in the capital and I have a friend there who's
willing to apprentice me. I'm sorry. The last thing I want to do is add
to your problems, but this is something I have to do. If you don't hit
it off with Major Jatarn, I can think of a few other people. It
shouldn't be that hard to find someone to replace me. <br>

replace you?

He refused. <br>

have asked us to walk won't always be a smooth one. <br>

it would be chaos. <br>

would choose me. My claim was foretold in the ancient texts. I was the

SISKO: We're not going to settle this by arguing over ancient texts. <br>
