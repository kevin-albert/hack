MOLLY: The picnic! <br>
O'BRIEN: What picnic? Is that today? <br>
MOLLY: Yes. Don't you remember? <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh, well, we'd better get going then. <br>
MOLLY: I'm going to wear my blue jumper. <br>
KEIKO: Oh, good idea, sweetie. <br>
(Molly runs out again.) <br>
O'BRIEN: I can't believe how much she's grown since I saw her last. <br>
(Keiko pats Miles' stomach.) <br>
KEIKO: Look who's talking. <br>
O'BRIEN: What? <br>
KEIKO: What have you been eating since we've been gone? <br>
O'BRIEN: The usual. <br>
KEIKO: Well, say goodbye to the usual. I'm back and you're going to
start eating right. <br>

MOLLY: Last time we went to Golana, you were inside Mommy's tummy. <br>

O'BRIEN: An exobologist? What's that? <br>
MOLLY: Someone who studies animals from other planets. <br>
KEIKO: Like Chester. <br>
MOLLY: Daddy, if you send us away again, can we take Chester? <br>
O'BRIEN: Honey, I'm not going to send you away again. <br>
MOLLY: You're not? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, I'm not. I only did it because it wasn't safe for you to
be on the station. <br>
MOLLY: I know. <br>

MOLLY: Promise? <br>

(And off Molly runs to play.) <br>
O'BRIEN: And what about you, little fellow? What do you say? <br>
(Contented gurgle.) <br>
O'BRIEN: I couldn't have said it better myself. Real sunshine, fresh
air, you and the kids. Life doesn't get any better than this. <br>
KEIKO: That was a pretty big promise you made, Miles, just a second
ago. <br>
O'BRIEN: I meant it. <br>
KEIKO: What if the war heats up again and the station isn't safe
anymore? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll put in for a transfer. I never want us to be apart again.

Molly is hanging on by her fingertips above a swirly purple thing.) <br>
MOLLY: Daddy, help. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(After the opening titles, Starfleet CSI has
arrived with all their tech to try and
solve the case. The portal is an irregular stone hexagon set at about
forty five degrees to the floor. There are other pieces of carved stone
around. Kira hugs Keiko and Yoshi.) <br>
KIRA: Keiko. <br>
(Kira goes over to Dax inside the hexagon.) <br>
KIRA: Have you figured out what this thing is yet? <br>
DAX: It's some sort of time portal. From the chroniton signature, we
think it sent Molly about three hundred years into the past. <br>
KIRA: I wonder what this place was like three centuries ago. <br>
DAX: Odo contacted the Bajoran Archaeological Institute to see what he
could find out. <br>
KIRA: How do we get Molly back? <br>
DAX: Well, first we have to find a way to reactivate the portal. It's
been abandoned a long time and it was destabilised when Molly fell
through. The problem is, we're not sure how this technology works. <br>
KIRA: Well, something tells me the Chief isn't going to stop until he
figures it out. <br>
DAX: Something tells me you're right. <br>
KIRA: Assuming you can get this back online, what then? <br>
DAX: We punch a transport scanning beam through the portal and then we
try to lock on to Molly's DNA signature. <br>
KIRA: And pull her back into the present. <br>
DAX: That's the idea. <br>
(O'Brien gets one thing working, then a second which promptly goes
bang!) <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh, bollocks! <br>
(Yoshi cries.) <br>
KEIKO: It's all right, sweetie. Shh, it's all right. <br>
O'BRIEN: Maybe you should take him up to the Defiant. It might be too
cold in here for him. <br>
KEIKO: I'm not going anywhere. <br>
KIRA: I'll take him. Come on. <br>
O'BRIEN: It's going to be all right, Yoshi. It's going to be all right.

ODO: You're very good with him. <br>
KIRA: He knows me. I had him inside of me for five months. Oh, I know.
I think I might want to have one of my own someday. <br>
ODO: According to the archaeologists I talked to, the portal was built
by a civilization that vanished two thousand years ago. Which means if
Molly survived the fall, she would have found herself all alone. <br>
KIRA: You're saying that the planet was uninhabited three hundred years
ago? <br>
ODO: The first Bajoran colonists didn't arrive till the turn of the
century. <br>
KIRA: An eight year old girl stranded alone on a deserted planet. Poor
Molly. <br>
ODO: With any luck, the Chief will be able to beam her out a few
minutes after she fell. She'll hardly know she was gone.

all day. Just tell me you're getting closer. <br>
O'BRIEN: I think I've found a way to modulate the temporal field
generators. If it works, Molly'll be home in a few hours. <br>
KEIKO: She's just been looking forward to coming out here ever since I
told her we were coming back to the station. Where's our baby? <br>
O'BRIEN: Shh. Dear, come on, come on. We're going to get her back.
Everything's going to be all right <br>

sequences match. This is definitely Molly. My readings suggest that
she's eighteen years old. <br>
O'BRIEN: We pulled her out ten years too late. <br>
BASHIR: It's a miracle you managed to get her back at all, Miles. <br>
KEIKO: Maybe if you tried again you could pull her out when she was
still a little girl. <br>
BASHIR: If you do that, there'll be no one to grow up and become this
Molly. You'd be erasing her existence. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, but we'll have our Molly back. <br>
KEIKO: Miles, this is our Molly. Just because we missed the last ten
years of her life doesn't give us the right to take those ten years
away from her. <br>
BASHIR: She's been deprived of human contact for a long time. It's not
going to be easy for her to reassimilate. Her language skills are
rusty. In fact, you two are the best hope we have of helping her
recover them. <br>
KEIKO: She doesn't remember us. <br>
O'BRIEN: She was so scared I doubt she even got a good look at us. <br>
BASHIR: It's possible that she's blocked out all memories of her
earlier life in order to cope with her isolation. <br>
KEIKO: So what do we do? <br>
BASHIR: I'm going to keep her under sedation until we get back to Deep
Space Nine. I've asked Captain Sisko to create a safe environment for
her. He's having one of the cargo bays converted. I want you two to be
there with her when she wakes up. <br>
KEIKO: What happens then? <br>
BASHIR: A case like this, there are no rules. We'll just have to feel
our way through the process. </font></p>

with babies. <br>
WORF: I raised Alexander. <br>
DAX: That's different. He was four years old when he moved in with you.
You didn't have to change diapers. Babies are a handful. I should know,
I've had nine of them. <br>
WORF: I know. Five as a mother, four as a father. I can handle a
fourteen month old child. <br>

against Kelvans twice my size. I courted and won the heart of the
magnificent Jadzia Dax. If I can do these things, I can make this child

baby-sitting thing so important all of a sudden? <br>
WORF: It is not important to me. It is important to you. <br>
DAX: What are you talking about? <br>
WORF: You are judging me on my fitness to be a parent. Don't deny it,
Jadzia. I can see it in your eyes. I have proven myself to be a worthy

O'BRIEN: She has no idea it's a holosuite. <br>
KEIKO: It must be confusing to her. One minute she's on a space
station, the next minute she's running around outside. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well there's no reason we can't take her here for an hour or
two every day. I'll talk to Quark about scheduling some regular time. <br>
(Molly hangs upside down from the tree.) <br>
MOLLY 2: Mummy, Mummy, Daddy. <br>
(Then runs back and turns a cartwheel.) <br>
O'BRIEN: That's my girl! <br>
(Doorbell.) <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll be right back. <br>
KEIKO: Okay. Ooo, look at this. <br>
(O'Brien opens the holosuite door. Quark is there with two Klingons.) <br>
QUARK: Sorry to interrupt, Chief, but your time is up. These gentlemen
have a reservation. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll pay for their time if they can wait another half hour. <br>
QUARK: They seem to have their hearts set on some afternoon carnage
now. <br>
O'BRIEN: All right. Give me a minute. <br>
QUARK: Let me buy you gentlemen a drink. <br>
KEIKO: Oh, pretty Molly. <br>
O'BRIEN: Molly, honey, we've got to go. Molly. <br>
O'BRIEN: Computer, end programme. We'll come back tomorrow. <br>
MOLLY 2: (distraught) Home! <br>
KEIKO: We have to go, honey.

O'BRIEN: It's okay, it's okay. <br>
KEIKO: Sweetie, we'll come back another day. I promise. <br>
(Molly breaks away and heads back to the holosuite. Quark grabs her.) <br>
QUARK: I'm sorry, little lady. <br>
(Molly bites Quark's arm then gets blocked by the Klingons.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: The Tarkalean she attacked is recovering in
the Infirmary. Doctor Bashir tells me he should be on his feet in a few
days. <br>
ODO: He's filed charges against her. Assault with a deadly weapon. <br>
O'BRIEN: She wasn't trying to hurt him, she was just trying to get
away. <br>
ODO: I tried to tell him that but he wasn't interested in hearing
excuses. As far as he's concerned, she's dangerous and should be
incarcerated. <br>
O'BRIEN: Incarcerated? <br>
SISKO: I've talked to the Federation magistrate and explained the
situation. She wants Molly taken to a special care centre on Dalvos
Prime for evaluation. <br>
O'BRIEN: They're going to keep her there, aren't they? <br>
SISKO: We might be looking at a long term situation, yes. But it's the
best facility of its kind. <br>
O'BRIEN: Molly belongs with Keiko and me. If she's going to make a
connection with anybody it's going to be us, not some therapist she
doesn't even know. <br>
SISKO: I'm sorry, Chief. I wish there were another way. <br>
O'BRIEN: Captain, please. Don't let them take her away.

BASHIR: Her body's flooded with adrenalin. I'm not sure how long she
can tolerate being confined like this. It might send her into shock. We
have to find a way to calm her down. <br>
O'BRIEN: Molly. Molly. <br>
MOLLY 2: Daddy, home. <br>
O'BRIEN: Molly, don't. <br>
(Molly walks into the forcefield and is thrown back onto the bed. She
tries again.) <br>
O'BRIEN: No! <br>
KEIKO: Miles! <br>
O'BRIEN: Turn it off, damn it! <br>
(The deputy does so just as Molly tries again.) <br>
O'BRIEN: Molly, Molly. <br>
MOLLY 2: Home. <br>
(Bashir hypos her.) <br>
KEIKO: What are we going to do? <br>
BASHIR: It won't do any good to keep sedating her like this. The bottom
line is, she needs open spaces and plenty of it. <br>
O'BRIEN: She's not going to get that at a special care centre. <br>
BASHIR: I'll talk to the Captain about putting her back in a holosuite
for the time being. <br>
O'BRIEN: But what happens when they put her on a transport? What
happens then?

uniform. Where's Kirayoshi? I thought you were going to watch him this
afternoon. Worf, what's wrong? <br>
BASHIR: Kirayoshi took a little fall. <br>
DAX: Is he all right? <br>
BASHIR: Oh, yes. Just a small bump on the forehead. Happens all the
time, children his age. A little sleep, he'll be as right as rain. <br>
DAX: Thanks. <br>
BASHIR: Well, I've got to get back to the Infirmary. <br>
(Bashir leaves.) <br>
DAX: You want to tell me what happened? <br>
WORF: We were playing. I was pretending to be a grint hound and chased
him. He was laughing so hard he did not look to see where he was going
and fell against the edge of the table. <br>
DAX: It was an accident. It could have happened to anyone. <br>
WORF: I was too rough with him. I was careless. You were right to
question my fitness as a father. <br>
DAX: Worf, I never questioned your fitness as a father. Don't put words
into my mouth. <br>
WORF: I failed Alexander, I failed Kirayoshi, and I would have failed
our children as well. <br>
DAX: Where are you going? <br>
WORF: I should not be here when he wakes up. <br>
DAX: Worf. <br>

adjust. <br>

something. <br>
O'BRIEN: What are you talking about? <br>
KEIKO: Miles, I've known you a long time. You are planning something
and you want to keep me out if it. <br>
O'BRIEN: The less you know, the better. <br>
KEIKO: Why? <br>
O'BRIEN: Because there's going to be consequences. <br>
KEIKO: So we'll face them together. She's my daughter too. <br>
O'BRIEN: Keiko, listen to me. <br>
KEIKO: Don't argue with me. I am as stubborn as you. Now, what are we
going to do? <br>
O'BRIEN: We're going to steal a runabout and take Molly back to Golana.
<br>
KEIKO: But that's the first place they'll look for her. They'll find
her, unless. Unless we send her back through the portal into the past. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yeah. Once she's through we can destroy it. That way no one
will ever find her. <br>
KEIKO: But we'll never see her again. <br>
O'BRIEN: I wish there were some other way. Golana's been her home for
ten years. She knows how to survive there. She'll be all right. </font></p>

PINAR: Doctor Bashir said she'd be unconscious for a few more hours.
We'll transfer her to a holosuite before she wakes up. <br>
O'BRIEN: There are no holosuites available. Odo said we should move her
back to the cargo bay. <br>
PINAR: He didn't mention it to me. <br>

O'BRIEN: Odo, please let us go. <br>
KEIKO: If you put her back in a holding cell, she'll die. <br>

O'BRIEN: Everything's ready to go. I've recalibrated the temporal field
generator. We should be able to put her back at the same point in time
when we took her out. Molly, honey, Can I show you something? <br>

WORF: Did you apologise to them for me? <br>
DAX: Yes, and they said not to worry about it. It isn't the first time
he's bumped his head. They invited us for dinner tonight to thank us
for watching him. <br>
WORF: What did you tell them? <br>
DAX: Well, I told them that we had a holosuite reservation, and that
I'd check you. By the way, what does gung gung gung mean? <br>
WORF: Why do you ask? <br>
DAX: Well, it was the strangest thing. I was taking Yoshi home and he
kept shaking his rattle, saying gung gung gung. <br>
WORF: He did? <br>
DAX: He seemed to get a bit kick out of it. So what does it mean? <br>
WORF: That is between Yoshi and me. <br>
DAX: Oh, I see. Well, you made a big impression on him. Maybe you're
not as bad with children as you thought. <br>

DAX: All right, maybe I had my doubts. But I've never been happier to
be proven wrong. Oh, we'd better get going if we're going to make that
holosuite reservation. <br>

MOLLY: She was so nice. <br>

sent her back to the same point in time it sent little Molly. <br>

was herself. <br>
O'BRIEN: I hope so. And I hope she realised that in a way she was going
