COMPUTER: Course laid in. <br>
O'BRIEN: Maximum warp. Engage. Time to Parada system? <br>
COMPUTER: One hour, fourteen minutes. <br>
O'BRIEN: Open a new file, computer. O'Brien, personal log, stardate
47581.2. I've
got to try to set the record straight about the last fifty two hours. I
don't know who's going to hear this. I don't even know if I'll be alive
by the time this log is recovered. I figure they'll be coming after me.
If I'm right about this whole thing, they won't want me to warn the
Paradas. Coffee, Jamaican blend, double strong, double sweet. I wish I
could tell you who they are. That's part of the puzzle I haven't
figured out yet. Part of the puzzle, hell. None of this whole damn
thing makes any sense. I'm trying to remember the first time I noticed
that things were wrong. It seems to me it was, yeah.

O'BRIEN: What are you two doing up so early? <br>
KEIKO: I had a lot of work to catch up on at school. Thought I'd get an
early start. <br>
O'BRIEN: At five-thirty in the morning? Coffee, Jamaican blend, double

KEIKO: I have a dozen essays to read. <br>
O'BRIEN: Did you have sweet dreams, darling? <br>

O'BRIEN: Don't I get my morning kiss? <br>
MOLLY: No. <br>

O'BRIEN: What did I do to deserve that? <br>
KEIKO: It's just a phase, Miles. She doesn't mean it. <br>
O'BRIEN: Huh? <br>
KEIKO: Don't let it bother you. <br>
O'BRIEN: What time did you get to bed last night? <br>
KEIKO: I don't know. Late. I didn't want to wake you. <br>
O'BRIEN: I was tired. I guess that trip really took it out of me. <br>
KEIKO: What did they have you doing? <br>
O'BRIEN: The Paradas? They put me through basic training on all the
security measures they want in place for the peace talks. Odo would
have had a field day. I wish he could have been there. <br>
KEIKO: I'd better get going. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll drop Molly at day care on my way to Ops. <br>
KEIKO: That's okay, I'm taking her with me. Molly? <br>
O'BRIEN: To school? When you've got all that reading to do? That
doesn't make a lot of sense. <br>
KEIKO: There's something I want to show her. A Vulcan programme that
teaches basic problem solving skills. <br>
O'BRIEN: At five-thirty-five in the morning? <br>
KEIKO: I want to do it while her mind is fresh. <br>
O'BRIEN: If you say so. <br>

O'BRIEN: Head start? Everybody seems to be getting a head start on me
today. <br>
DECURTIS: Sir? <br>
O'BRIEN: DeCurtis, I appreciate your bushy-tailed enthusiasm but I was
waiting for Odo to came back from Bajor to do this. We have to realign
the entire security net for the peace talks. The Constable might have a
few things to say about it all. <br>
DECURTIS: Commander Sisko didn't feel we should wait for Odo. <br>
O'BRIEN: Sisko gave you permission to start this without asking with me
first? I don't think so. <br>
DECURTIS: You might want to check with him, sir. I'm only following
orders. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll check with him all right. <br>

COMPUTER: Fifty three minutes. <br>
O'BRIEN: Direct sensors back toward the wormhole. Scan for other warp
signatures on this heading. <br>
COMPUTER: One warp signature found. <br>
O'BRIEN: Display. Can you identify? <br>
COMPUTER: Identification confirmed. Starfleet runabout Mekong. <br>
O'BRIEN: I figured as much. They'll wait for me to drop out of warp and

we. <br>

they might've been trying to pull off one of those surprise parties
that I can't stand, only my birthday's not until September, and believe
me, as it turned out, I had nothing else to celebrate. <br>
BASHIR: Ah, there he is now. I've been waiting for you, Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: What is it, Julian. <br>
BASHIR: No excuses this time. <br>
O'BRIEN: Excuses? <br>
BASHIR: I'd like you in my office in an hour. <br>
O'BRIEN: For what? <br>
BASHIR: Your physical. You can't put this off any longer. <br>
O'BRIEN: Look, this isn't a good day. <br>
BASHIR: It's a perfect day. Commander Sisko has arranged to have you
covered and <br>
O'BRIEN: What are you doing going to the Commander about my check-up? <br>
BASHIR: Because this has been. I just know how you feel about <br>
O'BRIEN: Forget it. I've got things to do. <br>
BASHIR: I'm afraid I'll have to insist. If I have to order you as your
superior officer, I will. <br>

BASHIR: Mister O'Brien says he's unavailable for a physical. <br>
SISKO: Make yourself available, Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: Commander. <br>

week at Starfleet. We've all had to go through this. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Commander's office]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Ensign DeCurtis mentioned to me that you
were a little upset. <br>
O'BRIEN: Not upset, exactly. <br>
SISKO: No, no, you had every right to be. I'm sorry I assigned him
before advising you. I guess I dropped the ball on that one. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, I guess I just felt a little left out of the loop, you
know. <br>
SISKO: Understood. I've gone through your reports on the Paradas. They
seem unusually preoccupied with security. <br>
O'BRIEN: They may be a little paranoid, but I suppose we would be too
if we'd been engaged in a civil war for twelve years. <br>
SISKO: Anything else I should know about them? Any unusual protocols we
should observe when they get here? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, nothing too out of the ordinary. It's all pretty much in
my report. <br>
SISKO: Now, tell me something that's not in the report. <br>
O'BRIEN: Sir? <br>
SISKO: You know, the kind of things we don't include in reports but
might help me in these talks. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, I'd have to give it some thought. There was one thing I
noticed. I don't know if it means anything or not, but the Paradas have
an odour from some kind of skin excretions, I'd guess. It changes with
their moods. When they're upset, it can get pretty strong actually. <br>
SISKO: I'll try not to get them upset. <br>
O'BRIEN: Good idea. <br>
SISKO: Their leaders have been in regular contact with us. I've assured
them that we'll be following all of their security recommendations to
the letter. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll see to that. <br>
SISKO: Well, I certainly want you to check everything before they get
here, but the upfront work can be done by the Engineering crews. I have
bigger problems for you. <br>
O'BRIEN: Bigger? <br>
SISKO: All three upper pylons are down again. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's impossible. I went over that repair work when I got
back. The pressure locks seemed to be at maximum efficiency. <br>
SISKO: You'd better check again. We had to tow a Bolian freighter to a
lower dock this morning. <br>
O'BRIEN: It can't be anything that serious. I rebuilt that entire
subsystem myself. I'll get on it right away. <br>
SISKO: After your physical. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. Oh, by the way, I noticed you and Keiko out in front
of the school this morning, talking. Is there anything wrong? <br>
SISKO: Oh, Jake is having some problems with his grades. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm sorry to hear that, sir. Keiko's very fond of the boy. I'm
sure she'll work that much harder to help him. <br>
SISKO: I'm sure she will.

BASHIR: Any dizziness? Oversleeping? Lack of energy? Euphoria? <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, all of them. Especially euphoria. Lots of euphoria. <br>
BASHIR: Seriously. <br>
O'BRIEN: Look, if you're determined to keep me here until you find
something wrong with me, I'll see if I can't grow you a hangnail. <br>
BASHIR: Eye problems? Hearing? Headaches? <br>
O'BRIEN: Headache. There you go. In fact, I'm getting a very bad one
right now. <br>
BASHIR: Short temper. Flies off the handle under the slightest
provocation. Perfectly normal behaviour. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm glad you're enjoying this. <br>

O'BRIEN: It's not doctors I have problems with. <br>
O'BRIEN + BASHIR: It's you, Julian. <br>
BASHIR: Well, your sense of humour seems normal enough <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't have a sense of humour. <br>
BASHIR: Cough. How's the sex life? <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't have a sense of humour. <br>
BASHIR: Cough. Everything all right in that department? <br>
O'BRIEN: That department is none of Starfleet's business, or yours. <br>
BASHIR: Mother and father in good health? <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh, come on, Julian. You knew my mother died two years ago. <br>
BASHIR: Did I? <br>
O'BRIEN: You don't remember me telling you when my father remarried
last spring? Me blathering on about this woman I've never met before? <br>
BASHIR: Of course. Now I remember. <br>
O'BRIEN: Are you finished? <br>
BASHIR: Not quite. I just have one or two more tests to run. <br>
O'BRIEN: This is insane! I haven't had a physical take this long since
I was born. Look, unless I'm dying or something, I think it's about
time. (pause) Wait. That's it, is it? I mean, there is something wrong
with me. That's why everyone seems so strange. <br>

get dressed.

fine, so it had to be an entirely new problem. I realised it wasn't
going to be a quick matter to track it down after all. And I couldn't
