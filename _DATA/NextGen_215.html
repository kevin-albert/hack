Captain's log, stardate 45571.2. We are going into orbit around an
unexplored M-class moon of Mab-Bu Six. Though the moon was reported to
be uninhabited, we have picked up a weak distress call.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: The intense electromagnetic whirlwinds on the
moon's surface make it virtually impossible to locate the source of the
signal, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Any indications of life, Mister Worf? <br>
WORF: Scanners read negative, sir, but they may be affected by the
interference. <br>
RIKER: Have you ever heard anything like this, Data? <br>
DATA: I believe so, Commander. At Starfleet Academy. <br>
PICARD: The Academy? <br>
DATA: I will verify it. Just as I thought. It is a Starfleet subspace
distress signal, standard to Daedalus-class starships. <br>
RIKER: There hasn't been a Daedalus class in service for what? <br>
DATA: One hundred seventy two years, sir. <br>
PICARD: Are there any records of missing ships in this vicinity? <br>
DATA: The USS Essex under the command of Captain Bryce Shumar
disappeared in this sector over two centuries ago. <br>
PICARD: Daedalus class. <br>
DATA: I have accessed the subspace transponder signature of the Essex.
It is identical to the signal coming from the moon's surface. <br>
RIKER: W arrived a little late. <br>
PICARD: Mute it, Mister Data. With that storm activity down there, it
isn't worth the risk to check on a ghost ship. Advise Starfleet that we
have solved the mystery of Captain Shumar and the Essex. <br>
TROI: I'm not sure we have. Someone's down there. Alive.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First officer's log, supplemental. The
electromagnetic interference on the surface has been judged too
dangerous for anyone to transport down, so we have taken a shuttle to
investigate.

harnesses
to keep them in their seats) <br>
DATA: Shields are holding, sir. <br>
RIKER: Wind shear is incredible. Data, keep an eye on the stabilisers.
If it's anything like this on the ground, I don't see how anyone can
survive on this moon for long. <br>
TROI: Maybe they've been living underground. <br>
RIKER: Question is where? I still can't locate the source of the damn
signal. It's bouncing around more than we are. <br>
DATA: Forward thrusters hav
