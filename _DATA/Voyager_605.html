All right, all right, hold on. If you were married in 2304 and your
daughter was conceived in your eleventh pon farr, that would make you a
hundred and sixty two years old. <br>
TUVOK: Incorrect. <br>
KIM: Come on, Tom, The man's not a day over one forty. We know you were
at least a hundred when you joined Starfleet the second time, so I'm
guessing you're around one thirty three? <br>
TUVOK: Also incorrect. I'm afraid you both lack sufficient data to
reach a logical conclusion. <br>
PARIS: Come on, Tuvok, tell us. <br>
TUVOK: I see no reason to enlighten you. <br>
KIM: Don't tell me Vulcans are embarrassed about their age. <br>
TUVOK: On the contrary. We value the wisdom that comes with advancing
years. <br>
PARIS: In that case, how wise are you? <br>
TUVOK: Wise enough to end this inquiry. <br>(Beep!)<br>
PARIS: Saved by the bell. <br>
KIM: I've got a fleet of ships two hundred thousand kilometres dead
ahead. <br>
TUVOK: Can you identify them? <br>
KIM: Negative. <br>
PARIS: I'm reading multiple hull configurations. <br>
TUVOK: Raise shields. Red alert. <br>(Janeway and Chakotay enter from the ready room.)<br>
JANEWAY: Report. <br>
TUVOK: We've detected a large group of vessels directly ahead. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Hostile? <br>
TUVOK: Possibly. I'm charging weapons. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. <br>
KIM: I'm counting sixty two ships and a few hundred pieces of ships. All
dead in space. <br>
PARIS: It's a junkyard. Congratulations, Tuvok. You just saved us from
a flotilla of hostile trash. <br>
KIM: We're being hailed. <br>

ABADDON [on viewscreen]: Welcome to Abaddon's Repository of Lost
Treasures. Whether you're in the mood to buy or simply browse, we're
always open. Take a look. You may find something you never knew you
wanted. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CHAKOTAY:
Mister Abaddon. <br>
ABADDON: The name was passed down from my father and his father before
him. Not a very imaginative lot, but I'll answer to it just the same. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm Commander Chakotay, this is Mister Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: Welcome to Voyager. <br>
ABADDON: Neelix, is it? You wouldn't be a fellow trader, would you? <br>
NEELIX: What makes you say that. <br>
ABADDON: Cheerful demeanour, furtive eyes. It's obvious you're a man of
commerce. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You're very perceptive, Mister Abaddon. <br>
ABADDON: A useful skill in my line of work. <br>
NEELIX: I'll admit there was a time when I dabbled in commerce but,
these days I focus my efforts on food and diplomacy. <br>
ABADDON: Well, whether you're interested in a new iso-convective oven
or a slightly dated translation matrix, you've come to the right place.
My inventory, give or take a few items. After twenty years, it's hard
to keep up. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Looks like you have an item or two we might be interested in.
<br>
NEELIX: Ah, the question is, what are you looking for in return? <br>
ABADDON: Artificial gravity plating. Plasma-based power induction. Impressive. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Those are integrated systems. Unfortunately, we couldn't
trade them to you without dismantling our whole ship. <br>
NEELIX: Commander, don't we have some spare duranium sheeting in cargo
bay one? With a few modifications, it could be converted into gravity
plating. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Good idea. Why don't you show Mister Abaddon our inventory?
Report back when you're done. <br>
NEELIX: Yes, sir. Mister Abaddon, follow me please. </font></p>

This guy's collected more technology than the Borg. <br>
SEVEN: And almost all of it is useless. <br>
PARIS: Wait. What's that? <br>
SEVEN: Ensign? <br>
PARIS: Grid forty nine alpha. Oh, she's beautiful. <br>
KIM: It's just an old rust bucket. <br>
PARIS: Are you kidding? Look at those lines. It's a work of art. That
ship wasn't assembled, it was sculpted. I think I'm in love. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">NEELIX:
That makes fifteen power regulators in fair condition, and three more
we could salvage with a little work. Seven has some doubts about the
ion exchange rods. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We'll take a chance. Add them to the list. What about these
cultural artefacts? <br>
NEELIX: Oh, just a few items I thought might have some historical
value. They don't cost much. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Looks like a good haul. If that's it? <br>
NEELIX: Oh yes, there is one other item. A small vessel that could be
an asset. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We've already got a full complement of shuttles, not to
mention the Delta Flyer. What do we need with this derelict ship? <br>
PARIS: Chakotay, this ship is a diamond in the rough. Sure, it's got
some scrapes and scratches, but, here, take a look at these systems. It
has a neurogenic interface that allows it to react directly to the
pilot's thoughts. That gives it the potential of being quicker and more
manoeuvrable than anything we've got, including the Delta Flyer. <br>
NEELIX: Add to that an optronic weapons array. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I get the picture. Are you sure you're not just looking for a
new toy? <br>
PARIS: No, absolutely not. Even B'Elanna thinks restoring this ship is
worthwhile. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe. If we had the manpower to restore it. <br>
PARIS: No, I'll do all the work myself. On my own time. And if I need a
hand, Harry's offered to help. <br>
KIM: I have? <br>
CHAKOTAY: What will it cost us? <br>
NEELIX: Abaddon's agreed to give it to us for three used power cells
and Tom's interactive record collection. <br>
PARIS: My jukebox. <br>
CHAKOTAY: All right. One slightly used alien ship. Don't make me regret
this. <br>
PARIS: You won't. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">ABADDON:
Remember, just one seat, not much storage. She was designed for speed,
not hauling. <br>
PARIS: Understood. <br>
ABADDON: Make sure you go easy on the thrusters. She doesn't like being
manhandled. <br>
NEELIX: Temperamental? <br>
ABADDON: Sensitive. She demands respect, like any fine piece of
machinery. <br>
PARIS: Sounds like you're sorry to let her go. <br>
ABADDON: Well, in some ways she's like the daughter I couldn't marry
off. But that doesn't mean I'd trade her to just anyone. I've got a
feeling you're the kind of pilot that she needs. Someone that'll give
her the proper care and attention. <br>
PARIS: I'm your man. <br>
NEELIX: Don't worry, Mister Abaddon, she's in good hands. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Transporter

still can't get an active readout. <br>
KIM: Here's the reason. Another damaged power cell. <br>
PARIS: Oh, come on, Alice, how about it? Give us a break. <br>
KIM: Alice? <br>
PARIS: Well, I've got to call her something. <br>
KIM: How about The Lost Cause? <br>
PARIS: Alice Battisti was the Lost Cause. I knew her back at the
Academy. She was smart, sexy, but she wouldn't give me the time of day.
<br>
KIM: All right, Alice it is. Try it again. <br>
PARIS: I've got a pulse. <br>
KIM: A little snug. <br>
PARIS: As Seven would say, an efficient design. The main computer's
coming online. <br>
KIM: There's not much in it. Just a few schematics. Looks like somebody
tried to wipe the database. <br>
PARIS: Probably rolled the odometer back, too. Let's see what this
neurogenic interface can do. <br>(A metal band comes out of the pilot's head restraint half way around his head. The ship powers up properly.)<br>PARIS: Whoa. <br>
KIM: What's it like? <br>
PARIS: It's kind of hard to describe. I'm tapped into all the primary
systems. Ops, tactical, sensors. <br>(Then it switches off and the band retracts.)<br>PARIS: What happened? <br>
KIM: We just blew out two more power cells. <br>
PARIS: See if you can reconfigure the power distribution grid. <br>
KIM: Look, we're both tired. Why don't we call it a night, come back
fresh tomorrow? <br>
PARIS: Come on, we can still get a couple more hours in. <br>
KIM: You can get a couple more hours in. I'm going to bed. <br>
PARIS: All right, you win. Good night, Alice. See you in the morning. <br>(They leave the shuttlebay. The little ship powers up.)<br>
PARIS [on monitor]: Good night, Alice. See you in the morning. See you

can't get her to bring her propulsion systems online. <br>

Something her last pilot used to wear. <br>

Seven, can I get you something? <br>
SEVEN: A refund. The star charts we obtained from Abaddon are
inaccurate. <br>
NEELIX: Really? <br>
SEVEN: The computations are based on obsolete data. <br>
NEELIX: It's not the only item that didn't live up to its advertising. <br>(Seven looks at the items Neelix is cleaning.)<br>
SEVEN: Cultural artefacts? <br>
NEELIX: According to Abaddon, they're lost treasures of the Delta
quadrant. If you ask me, they're worthless trinkets. (She picks up a gem embedded in a piece of clear material.)<br>
SEVEN: Perhaps not. This crystal is beryllium. <br>
NEELIX: Valuable? <br>
SEVEN: Beryllium is the standard currency in spatial grid five three
nine. There are species that would trade an entire fleet of starships
for this trinket. <br>
NEELIX: If Abaddon knew about this, he'd never have traded it for a few
plasma couplings. Maybe I should return it. <br>
SEVEN: Need I remind you? All trades are final. <br>
PARIS: Neelix, I need one bottle of champagne, if you don't mind. <br>
NEELIX: Another anniversary? <br>
PARIS: No, I'm christening Alice. <br>
NEELIX: Congratulations. I'll whip up some hors d'oeuvres for the crew.
<br>
PARIS: Oh no, don't bother. This is a private ceremony. Just me and
B'Elanna. <br>
NEELIX: And Alice, of course. <br>
PARIS: Oh yes, of course. <br>
NEELIX: There's nothing like having your own ship. I remember when I
first laid eyes on my little freighter, Baxial. <br>
PARIS: No, don't tell me. Love at first sight. <br>
NEELIX: Actually, I thought she was the ugliest thing I ever saw. But
she grew on me. Eventually, I couldn't imagine being without her. You
know, she's still down at the shuttlebay. Why don't we get her and
Alice together and go on a double date. <br>

navigational array, er, plasma manifolds. The list goes on and on. Just
a few more repairs, and she'll be spaceworthy. Care to do the honours?

ALICE [OC]: Please specify, Tom. <br>
PARIS: Five degrees should do it. <br>

TORRES: Sounds like a real slave driver. Well, if you're trying to make
improvements, you might want to start with these reactant injectors. The
deuterium mix is too high. <br>

parts right now. <br>
PARIS: They're just lying around Cargo Bay two. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Those are emergency supplies, and this isn't an emergency. <br>
PARIS: Okay, what if I just replicated some? <br>
CHAKOTAY: That takes energy, which isn't exactly in abundance at the
moment. Maybe in a few weeks, if we can replenish our power reserve. <br>
PARIS: A few weeks? What am I supposed to do until then? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Your duties, which you've been neglecting. You've been late
for two shifts in Sickbay. You've been distracted on the bridge.
Maybe it's time you gave this project a rest. <br>
PARIS: Yeah, you're right. I guess I have been overdoing it. <br>

the Doctor take a look at you. <br>

would grind to a halt without them. <br>(A brunette in the same style of flight suit is leaning against Alice's hull.)<br>
ALICE: But we're so close. <br>

You're thinking about your first flight, aren't you? Tell me. <br>

won't be bothering you anymore. <br>

ABADDON: She can't fly herself, she needs a pilot. A biological entity
to work in tandem with her programming. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, if all she needed was a pilot, why didn't she just
recruit you? <br>
ABADDON: I wasn't compatible. She said my reflexes were too slow, that
I was as useless as the junk that I traded, and I couldn't get her to
where she needed to go. Don't ask me for the coordinates. She never
told me. Just insisted that I get her a real pilot. I'm sorry I didn't
