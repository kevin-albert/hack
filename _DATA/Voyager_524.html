Show mercy. <br>
NEELIX: Your people have a saying. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me
twice, shame on me. In other words, your credit's no good here. <br>
PARIS: I'll pay you back double with next month's replicator rations. <br>
NEELIX: That's what you said when I let you replicate all those pork
rinds for your monster movie marathon. <br>
PARIS: Let me put it another way. This is a life and death situation. <br>
NEELIX: Hyperbole won't help. <br>
PARIS: I'm not exaggerating. This is the anniversary of my first date
with B'Elanna. <br>
NEELIX: And you forgot all about it? <br>
PARIS: Yes. And if I don't come through with some kind of romantic
dinner<br>
NEELIX: All right, you've made your case. <br>
PARIS: Neelix, you're a saint. Okay, that'll be one bottle of Mouton
Rothschild, a 2342 if it's in the database. A Terrelian pheasant, steamed
asparagus, and a single rose. <br>
NEELIX: Where do you want it? <br>
PARIS: You can send the food requisition to B'Elanna's replicator, the
wine and the flower I'll take with me. I can't show up empty-handed. <br>(Kim enters.)<br>
KIM: Neelix, how about a pot of coffee while you're at it? <br>
NEELIX: Coming right up. <br>
KIM: Flowers and wine? <br>
PARIS: Ah, anniversary. Coffee? <br>
KIM: Bridge duty. I've got eight hours ahead of me. <br>
NEELIX: Sitting in the big chair again? <br>
KIM: Fourth night in a row. <br>
PARIS: You're not fooling anyone. <br>
KIM: Excuse me? <br>
PARIS: You love these night shifts. Your chance to play Captain. <br>
KIM: I'm not playing. This is an opportunity to get command experience.
You might put in for some yourself. <br>
PARIS: Oh, what's the point of trying to compete with an ambitious
upstart like you? Just promise me one thing. When you reach the top,
you'll remember all the little people you climbed over to get there. You
won't make them work night shifts?

JENKINS: Same as it was twenty minutes ago. <br>
KIM: Refresh my memory. <br>
JENKINS: Current speed warp six point three, heading oh twenty one mark
two. Permission to speak freely, sir? <br>
KIM: Granted. <br>
JENKINS: We're on the night shift. Relax. <br>
KIM: One of these days you'll get the call to take the bridge, and
maybe then you'll understand the burden of command. <br>(Beep!) <br>KIM: Report. <br>
JENKINS: It's an automated distress call. <br>
KIM: Origin? <br>
JENKINS: A class M planet, range point seven three light years, bearing
two six one mark one five. <br>
KIM: That would be a significant course change. <br>
JENKINS: The burden of command is on your shoulders, sir. Of course, we
could always wake Commander Chakotay. <br>
KIM: No. Alter course. <br>(They arrive at the planet.)<br>KIM:
Open a channel. This is Ensign Kim of the Starship Voyager. Can we be
of assistance? <br>
JENKINS: I'm not picking up on any lifesigns. I guess they didn't make
it. <br>
KIM: There could be any number of reasons why we're not detecting
lifesigns. We'll have to go down there and take a look. I'll inform the
Commander. Oh, Jenkins? The bridge is yours.

KIM: Sorry, sir, but I thought <br>
CHAKOTAY: Relax, Harry, you did the right thing on both counts. Hey,
why don't you lead the away team? I'll monitor your progress from the
bridge. <br>
KIM: Yes, sir. <br>(A short time later, Kim has got his equipment for the away team.)<br>EMH: The
distress call was automated? <br>
KIM: That's right. I'm hoping whoever sent it is still alive. <br>
EMH: Who's leading the mission? <br>
KIM: You're looking at him. <br>
EMH: Really? <br>
KIM: Problem? <br>
EMH: No. I just thought, given the circumstances, a new planet, unknown
hazards, that Commander Chakotay or Tuvok would be in charge. <br>
KIM: I am a senior officer, Doc. I've been on this ship for five years.
I think I can handle an away mission. <br>

you sure these are the right coordinates? <br>
KIM: Positive. <br>
EMH: Apparently, whoever sent the distress call was rescued. <br>
KIM: Maybe, but as long as we're here we should make a thorough search.
Spread out. <br>
EMH: Ensign. <br>(The EMH has found a device half buried into a rock wall.)<br>
KIM: This is the source of the distress call. <br>
EMH: What is it? <br>
KIM: I don't know. Paratrinic shielding, a dense energy matrix,
bioneural circuitry. <br>
EMH: Bioneural? <br>(The device lights up.)<br>
KIM: Whoa, back off. This could be dangerous. <br>
EMH: No, wait. It's speaking to us. <br>
KIM: Speaking? <br>
EMH: In duotronic algorithms. Hold on. My translation matrix is
interpreting. It says it's injured. It needs our help. It's asking why
it can't see, or feel its arms and legs. It's terrified. Can you
identify yourself? It's saying that its memory has been damaged. It
doesn't remember its name. Don't worry. We're going to help you.
Crewman Lang will remain with you. <br>
KIM: What do you think? An artificial intelligence? <br>
EMH: One that doesn't seem to realise its artificial. <br>
KIM: Maybe we should tell it the truth. try to jog its memory. <br>
EMH: No. I don't want to risk psychological trauma. <br>
KIM: Psychological trauma? Doc, this is a machine. <br>
EMH: One which is confused and asking for our help. We should beam it
aboard. <br>

dictate that we <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH:
We're going to transport you back to our ship. I'm Voyager's Emergency
Medical Hologram. A projection of light and force fields guided by an
optronic computer programme. No.&nbsp; Technically speaking, I suppose I'm
not a real person.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
How's our patient? <br>
TORRES: Complicated. It uses bioneural circuitry to mimic humanoid
synaptic functions. <br>
KIM: But its memory core is damaged. It's suffering from a
technological form of amnesia. <br>
JANEWAY: Any theories as to what it might be? <br>
TORRES: It could be a probe, or a communications device. <br>
EMH: Whoever our friend is, he wasn't alone. He claims to have been
travelling with a companion. <br>
JANEWAY: If there's another one down there, it might give us a few
answers. I'll be in Astrometrics scanning the surface. Give our guest
my regards. <br>
EMH: Of course, Captain. Lower the containment field. <br>(The EMH approaches the device.)<br>EMH:
How are you?
Well, that's an interesting question. Ensign Kim and Lieutenant Torres
are attempting to repair your damaged circuitry. That's what I wanted
to talk to you about. You're not an organic being. You're
technological. You're an artificial intelligence embedded in a machine
of some kind. No, there's no mistake. We believe the damage you
suffered in the crash is causing your confusion. Look at it this way.
You and I have something in common. Just because we're not organic
beings doesn't mean we're in any way inferior. Well, you're metallic,
over a metre in length, cylindrical. Oh, you're quite sleek, actually.
You're welcome.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
I'm detecting no further technology on the planet surface. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe the second device was destroyed when it crashed. Scan
for metallic particulates consistent with our friend in Engineering. <br>
SEVEN: There are minute traces scattered across the northern continent.
<br>
JANEWAY: Isolate. An impact crater. <br>
SEVEN: It spans a radius of two hundred kilometres. <br>
JANEWAY: And look at this. Heavy concentrations of radiogenic decay in
the crater walls. And the fracture gradients are consistent with a
highly focused explosion. <br>
SEVEN: Evidently, we've discovered its function. <br>
JANEWAY: A weapon of mass destruction.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Briefing
room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: I
understand your concerns, but the device hasn't shown itself to be
hostile. <br>
TORRES: Not yet. But it's only a matter of time before it puts the
pieces together. <br>
EMH: All the more reason we should talk to it, explain our concerns. Ask for help in defusing its explosive components. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If it's programmed to detonate, there's no telling how it will
react. <br>
JANEWAY: Agreed, We have to neutralise the threat now. Suggestions? <br>
SEVEN: Transport the device off the ship and destroy it before it harms
anyone. <br>
EMH: Seven, this is a sentient being we're talking about. <br>
SEVEN: Very well. Return it to the surface and deploy a warning buoy to
alert other vessels. <br>
EMH: I refuse to believe our only options are to kill it or abandon it.
<br>
TORRES: What if we could separate the bioneural circuitry from the
explosive? <br>
JANEWAY: Take the weapon offline but salvage the intelligence. <br>
KIM: They're fully integrated. Where would we store the intelligence
once we shut the device down? <br>
EMH: The answer's obvious. Download it's synaptic patterns to a
holographic matrix, like mine. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Then what? <br>
EMH: Try to find out where it came from, and return it to it's people. <br>
SEVEN: The device is extremely complex. One error and we'd risk
detonation. <br>
EMH: Saving life often entails risk. <br>
JANEWAY: Harry, B'Elanna, assist the Doctor. <br>
EMH: Thank you, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: At the first sign of danger, we transport it off the ship.
Understood? <br>
EMH: Understood. </font></p>

quite understand. I wouldn't like being carried around, either. Of
course you are, who wouldn't be? We're taking you to Sickbay. Because
we're better equipped to help you there.

we ready to proceed? <br>

EMH: Don't be alarmed. We have to access some of your systems to enable
the transfer. He says he wants to know exactly what you're doing, as
you do it. <br>
TORRES: This is a delicate procedure. I won't be able to concentrate if
I have to give a blow-by-blow description. <br>
EMH: You'll have to forgive Lieutenant Torres. She's an excellent
engineer. Unfortunately, she doesn't share my bedside manner. <br>
TORRES: Harry, would you mind? <br>
KIM: Yeah, sure. Er, well, first we're going to be setting up an active
interlink between you and the holo-systems. Er, now, to do that, er,
we're going to take your programme offline while we resequence your
bioneural circuitry. <br>

you were really trying to shut me down. <br>
TORRES: You're the artificial intelligence. <br>

<br>
KIM: You remember it now? <br>
BOMB/EMH: Yes. I'm a long range tactical armour unit. I've been
deployed by my people. They're facing a terrible threat. A hostile
species. My companion unit was destroyed, but I will reach my target.

five, for that matter. <br>
JANEWAY: Get a transporter lock on our people. We'll jettison the whole
damn section if we have to. <br>
BOMB/EMH [on viewscreen]: I wouldn't recommend that, Captain. If you
try to stop me again, I'll detonate. Your ship and everyone on it will
be destroyed. <br>

You'll proceed to the coordinates at maximum velocity. <br>
JANEWAY: Doctor? <br>
BOMB/EMH [on viewscreen]: He's gone. <br>
PARIS: He's directing us to a system two point three light years from
here. <br>
JANEWAY: Is that your home? <br>
BOMB/EMH [on viewscreen]: It's my target. The course I've plotted
bypasses enemy minefields. Don't deviate from it. Your ship won't be
harmed. Once we've reached the system, you'll transport me to my target.
<br>
JANEWAY: We won't help you wage war. This crew has a Prime Directive
that forbids us to interfere in the affairs of other species. <br>
BOMB/EMH [on viewscreen]: You've already interfered. <br>
JANEWAY: We were trying to help you. <br>
BOMB/EMH [on viewscreen]: Until you discovered my true nature. Then you
tried to deactivate me. <br>
JANEWAY: Just your explosive components, not you. <br>

alter course or I'll detonate! <br>
JANEWAY: If you do that, you'll never reach your target, will you? <br>
BOMB/EMH [on viewscreen]: I am programmed to take whatever measures are
necessary to obtain my objective. Failing that, I'm to consider anyone
who tries to stop me an enemy. Now alter course, and transfer your
sensors to me so I can monitor your compliance. <br>
JANEWAY: Release my crewmen from Sickbay first. <br>
BOMB/EMH [on viewscreen]: I'm not programmed to negotiate. They'll
remain were they are. <br>
JANEWAY: Lay in the course, Mister Paris. Transfer sensors to Sickbay. <br>
BOMB/EMH [on viewscreen]: A sound tactical decision, Captain. <br>(Transmission ends.)<br>
JANEWAY: Assemble the staff. We're going to find a way to outsmart a
smart bomb. <br>(A little later, the brainstorming has begun.)<br>PARIS:
If we could shut down the force fields around Sickbay, I could get a
transporter lock on it. <br>
SEVEN: Even if you were successful, we can't beam it far enough from
the ship to escape the blast. <br>
CHAKOTAY: She's right. Our best option is to disarm it. <br>PARIS: Good luck. It's got an internal sensor array. If we try so much
as to loosen a screw, boom. <br>(Neelix enters with a piece of tech.)<br>
NEELIX: Commander, I think you should take a look at this. It's a power
node I used to enhance the replicator system. I acquired it last week
on a trading mission. It has transkinetic energy regulators and
bioneural control circuitry. Remind you of anything? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Our friend in Sickbay.&nbsp;<br>
NEELIX: I didn't make the connection at first, but when I overheard a
few of the engineers talking about the weapon I went back and I checked
the schematics on this. It's the same technology. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Who did you acquire it from? <br>
NEELIX: A merchant named Onquanii. <br>
SEVEN: Did he say where he got it? <br>
NEELIX: No, but he seemed eager to trade. Maybe he'd tell us if we made
it worth his while. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Scan for his vessel. If you find him, send an encoded
message. Tell him about our problem. <br>
PARIS: Aye, sir. </font></p>

If we could tap into the holo-projectors without his knowing it we
might be able to shut him down. <br>
KIM: He changed all the access codes. The second we try to decrypt
them, he'll restart the detonation sequence. <br>

KIM: Yeah. Let the Captain handle it. The last thing anyone needs is my
opinion. <br>

talking bomb on board. <br>
TORRES: The first time I commanded an away mission, I led my people
into a cave that I thought was a Cardassian military installation.
Turned out I'd mistaken unstable mineral deposits for weapons
signatures. There was a rock slide and we were stuck there for three
days. <br>

KIM: You're a sentient being. You don't have to be a slave to your

BOMB/EMH: He's a tool. A holographic puppet. <br>
KIM: That puppet saved your life. If it weren't for him you'd still be
damaged and alone on that planet. He's the one that convinced me to
beam you aboard. And when we discovered what you were, and some people
wanted to destroy you, the Doctor defended your right to exist. <br>
BOMB/EMH: What's your point? <br>
KIM: Even though he was only programmed to be a doctor, he's become
more than that. He's made friends, he's piloted a starship, he even
sings. <br>
BOMB/EMH: Despite all of his achievements, did he ever stop being a doctor? <br>

KIM: It doesn't have to be. We can give you your own holo-matrix. You
can exist for as long as you want. Accomplish anything you set your
mind to. <br>

BOMB/EMH: A military installation on Salinia Prime. Grid eleven, vector
nine three four one. <br>
KIM: Tell me about it. Who's the enemy? <br>
BOMB/EMH: A ruthless, violent race that's threatening to destroy my
people. <br>

there forests, wildlife, schools for the children of this violent race?

BOMB/EMH: I'm not programmed with superfluous data. <br>

in your possession? <br>
NEELIX: Actually, we're in its possession. We're being held hostage. Do
you know anything about this weapon? <br>
ONQUANII [OC]: If I'm correct, it was created by a species named the

you.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(This alien has high forehead ridges and no lips.)<br>ONQUANII:
You've deactivated your comm. system? <br>
JANEWAY: And reinforced the shielding in this section. We won't be
overheard. <br>
ONQUANII: I'd have more faith in your security precautions if you
weren't already at the mercy of this weapon. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We didn't know what it was when we brought it aboard. <br>
ONQUANII: This particular series has a class eleven intelligence
factor. It's warp-capable, fully armoured, self-guiding. It has a
maximum range of eighty light years. It can fly through an ion storm or
an armada of hostile ships and still find its target. <br>
JANEWAY: Charming. How do I get it off my ship? <br>
ONQUANII: You can't. But I can. My transporter system employs a
dampening field which disables the detonator until my engineers can
disarm it. <br>
JANEWAY: That's a generous offer. Mind if I ask what you expect in
return? <br>
ONQUANII: The device itself. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm not about to hand over a weapon of mass destruction to
someone I just met. <br>
ONQUANII: Oh, my business is salvage, not war. I've no intention of
deploying it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: But you might sell it to someone who does. I imagine you'd
stand to make quite a profit. <br>
ONQUANII: I can make more profit by selling off it's components. The
energy matrix alone can power a fleet of starships. And its
intelligence core, properly reprogrammed, can assist in a variety of
things, from terraforming to planetary weather control. <br>
JANEWAY: All right. You can have the weapon, as long as we keep the
energy matrix. That way we can be sure no one ever deploys it. <br>
ONQUANII: I'm afraid that's unacceptable. The energy matrix is one of
the most valuable components. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry, it's not open for negotiation. <br>
NEELIX: We could offer you a few dilithium crystals in compensation. <br>
ONQUANII: That matrix worth a thousand dilithium crystals. <br>
NEELIX: What if we threw in a plasma manifold? <br>
ONQUANII: I want the entire weapon, or it remains here. Captain? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You seem awfully intent for someone only interested in
salvage. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry to waste your time. We'll have to find another way
to solve our problem. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TORRES:
I've reconfigured the bioneural matrix. <br>
KIM: Ready? I'm sorry. <br>
BOMB/EMH: I am simply completing my mission. Only the target has
changed. <br>(The EMH fritzes, and the bomb wakes up.)<br>
TORRES: Transfer complete. <br>
EMH: Please state the nature of the. What happened? How long was I
offline? <br>
TORRES: We'll explain later. Seven needs your help. <br>
KIM: Bridge, energise. <br>(The bomb is beamed into the flotilla. One of them grabs it with a tractor beam and they fly away.)

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CHAKOTAY:
They've gone into warp. <br>
JANEWAY: Maintain long range sensors. <br>(The bomb detonates, starting a chain reaction.)<br>
TUVOK: I'm detecting a series of antimatter explosions. <br>
CHAKOTAY: In proximity to what? <br>
TUVOK: No ships. No planets. Nothing. <br>
JANEWAY: Bridge to Ensign Kim. The weapons have been destroyed.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM:
Anyone home? <br>
EMH: Ensign. Feeling well I hope? <br>
KIM: Perfect. On my way to the Bridge for another night shift. I came
by to check on Seven. <br>
EMH: You just missed her. <br>
KIM: What's her prognosis? <br>
EMH: She'll need another week of regeneration, but I expect she'll make
a full recovery. <br>
KIM: Good news.&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b><br></font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: Considering I was responsible for her injuries, you can imagine my
relief. <br>
KIM: Well, you weren't exactly yourself at the time. <br>
EMH: That's not what I mean. I was the one who asked you to bring that
device aboard in the first place. I even argued with the Captain to
keep it aboard after we learned what it was. <br>
KIM: It was an artificial intelligence, like you. But I have to admit,
his personality made you seem like Mister Congeniality. Look, Doc, the
truth is I never would have gotten through to him without you. <br>
EMH: From what I've heard, I wasn't much help. <br>
KIM: You were. I held you up as an example of how an artificial
intelligence could exceed its programming. I didn't realise how true
that was until today. <br>
EMH: It seems your strategy worked. Thank you. <br>
KIM: I'd better get to the bridge. You never know when Ensign Kim will
be called upon to take command again. <br>
EMH: Voyager could do worse.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM:
Helm, status? <br>
JENKINS: Current speed, warp five, heading oh twenty one, mark three. <br>
KIM: Anything on long range sensors? <br>
JENKINS: Nothing to report. <br>
KIM: As you were. <br>
JENKINS: Permission to speak freely, sir. <br>
KIM: Why would tonight be any different? <br>
JENKINS: People have been talking about you. <br>
KIM: Oh? <br>
JENKINS: Rumour has it you were the one who outsmarted the smart bomb. <br>
KIM: Well, not exactly. I made First Contact with a sentient being. All
I did was help it understand a few things. The rest was up to him. <br>
JENKINS: Understood. Actually, I've been authorised by the junior staff
to thank you for keeping us in one piece. <br>
KIM: You're welcome. Any time. Do me a favour? <br>
JENKINS: Of course, sir. <br>
KIM: No more distress calls. At least not tonight. </font> </p>
