CRUSHER: Most people on this colony will remember my grandmother as a
healer, but her abilities went beyond that. She didn't just relieve
pain and fight illness. She knew that wellbeing is more than a healthy
body. Her remedies often included words of advice as well as medicinal
teas, and often they were just as bitter tasting. I will miss Felisa
Howard very much. Her healing, her advice, and most of all, the
inspiration she has provided me throughout the years. Rest in peace,
Nana. <br>
MATURIN: (not human) And so now we commit her body to the ground, earth
to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and certain hope that
her memory will be kept alive within us all. <br>
ALL: Amen. <br>
(most people through soil onto the coffin, but one man throws a
camellia. A little later, after the titles) <br>
TROI: That was a beautiful. <br>
CRUSHER: Oh, thank you. Deanna, did you notice a strange man at the
service? He was in his mid-thirties with longish hair? <br>
TROI: No. <br>
CRUSHER: He threw a flower on Nana's grave. A camellia. It was her
favourite flower. She used to keep them all over the house. <br>
TROI: Maybe he was a friend or one of her patients. <br>
CRUSHER: It was a very personal gesture, and he gave me a remarkable
look. Well, I guess I should be going back to the house. There are some
things I need to do. It's only a few minutes from here. Would you mind
coming along? <br>
TROI: I'd love to. <br>
CRUSHER: Thanks. <br>
MATURIN: How long do you plan on staying? <br>
PICARD: A few more hours. Why? <br>
MATURIN: Well, as you know, Caldos is one of the first terraforming
projects of the Federation. Our weather controls and fusion systems are
nearly a century old. I wouldn't mind having a starship Engineer take a
look at them. Perhaps give us a few upgrades. Maybe in exchange for a
tour of the colony and a home-cooked meal? <br>
PICARD: Well, we are due at Starbase six two one tomorrow morning, but
we could delay for a few days. Yes, I'm sure we could find the time. <br>
MATURIN: Excellent. <br>
PICARD: I would enjoy that tour. Caldos Colony is a most impressive
accomplishment. I actually feel as if I'm in the Scottish Highlands. <br>
MATURIN: That was the intent. The cornerstone of every building in town
was brought from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen. The founders wanted
everyone to feel they had a piece of the real thing here. They didn't
want to just imitate Scotland, they wanted to recreate it. <br>
PICARD: Tell me, Governor, I'm curious. You're obviously not Scots
yourself. What was it that drew you here? <br>
MATURIN: Something about the culture, the heritage. When I was a boy,
my family visited Glamis Castle in Scotland. As I looked out across the
highlands, I felt as if I had come home.

CRUSHER: Every woman in the Howard family has had green eyes, except
for my mother and me. <br>
TROI: How well do you remember your mother? <br>
CRUSHER: Very well. I loved her very much. I can remember her face
smiling down at me, and I can remember the sound of her voice and her
scent. But mostly I remember Nana, who raised me after my mother died. <br>
(she picks up a pierced metal lamp with a flickering candle in it) <br>
TROI: That's beautiful. <br>
CRUSHER: It's a family heirloom. It's been in the Howard clan for
generations. It's supposed to symbolise the enduring Howard spirit.
Wherever they may go, the shining light to guide them through their
fortune. Nana always kept it lit. I remember sitting here listening to
ghost stories with only the candle burning. <br>

I've spent more time here in the past five years than ye have in the
past twenty. <br>

QUINT: I'm Ned Quint. I took care of your grandmother's house and her

CRUSHER: Nana never mentioned you. <br>
QUINT: There's a lot of things she didna talk about. Let me get rid of
that candle. <br>
CRUSHER: Why? <br>
QUINT: That candle has brought nothing but misery and bad luck to your
grandmother. <br>
CRUSHER: Look, Mister Quint, I don't know what your relationship was
with my grandmother, but this is my house now and these are my things. <br>
QUINT: That candle has been a curse on your family for generations. If
ye have a lick of sense, you'll listen to me right now and do away with
it. Now give it to me. <br>
CRUSHER: This is a family heirloom and I intend to keep it. Now would
you please get out of my house. Now! <br>
QUINT: Howard women. Always the same stubborn fools. I wash my hands of
it now. You stay on in this house and you keep that damned candle. I'll
not be responsible for what happens. <br>

MATURIN: You can't imagine what it's like trying to enjoy afternoon tea
while the earth is shaking. <br>
LAFORGE: Governor, did you know you had a power fluctuation in your
weather control system? <br>
MATURIN: No. Our weather control's been working perfectly for the last
twenty two years. <br>
LAFORGE: I can't isolate the exact source, but the fluctuation seems to
be originating from one of the substations that regulates atmospheric
humidity for the colony. <br>
MATURIN: Is this going to be a problem? <br>
LAFORGE: No, not yet, but power distribution patterns are already off
by five percent. <br>
DATA: I suggest we analyse the planet's weather patterns to see if they
have been affected. I am reading unusually high humidity across the
entire southern desert region and there is increasing cloud activity
above the northern coastal area. Possibly the formation of a storm
system. <br>
MATURIN: A storm? It's the middle of summer. We don't have rain at this
time of year. <br>
LAFORGE: Data, let's see if we can correct this. I'll check out the
colony's climatic flow array. <br>

reading about in my grandmother's journals. You know she had a lover?
Can you believe that? Nana was a hundred years old. <br>
PICARD: It would seem the Howard women have exceptionally vigorous
libidos. <br>
CRUSHER: I certainly hope so. After all, I hope I can find a handsome
young man in his thirties when I pass the century mark. <br>
PICARD: Thirties? <br>
CRUSHER: Yes. According to these journals, his name is Ronin and he's
thirty four years old. They met just after my great-grandmother's
death. And I think I saw him at the funeral. A handsome young man
tossed a camellia onto her grave. But the strange thing is, she never
mentioned him in her letters. Never once. And yet it appears they spent
almost all their time together. It's as if she led an entire life that
I knew nothing about. <br>

CRUSHER: A pair of hands. They were moving across my skin. <br>
TROI: Like a caress? <br>
CRUSHER: Yes. And there was a voice, a man. He whispered my name. It
was as if I knew him, or more like he knew me. He knew exactly how I
liked to be touched. It was the most physical dream I've ever had. The
sensations were very real and extremely arousing. <br>
TROI: Frankly, I'm envious. <br>
CRUSHER: I did fall asleep reading a particularly erotic chapter in my
grandmother's journal. She wrote very detailed descriptions of her
experiences with Ronin. <br>

going over the personnel reports? <br>

CRUSHER: I thought it was pretty self-explanatory. I'm leaving
Starfleet. Energize. <br>
PICARD: Belay that order. <br>
CREWMAN: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Beverly, you can't just resign. <br>
CRUSHER: I can, and I have. I've decided to stay on Caldos and become a
healer like my grandmother. It's a proud Howard tradition and I've
decided to uphold it. Energise. I've resigned my commission, so unless
you plan on kidnapping me? <br>
(Picard nods and she is beamed away)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TROI: Beverly was attracted to Ronin in a very
intense and intimate way. I warned her that it was all very sudden but
she didn't want to talk about it, so I let her alone. I sensed that she
was holding something back, that she wasn't telling me the whole truth.
<br>
PICARD: Do you think this Ronin could be exerting some sort of
influence over her? That it's because of him that she's staying? <br>
TROI: It's possible. But she may really believe she's in love with him.
<br>
PICARD: This is a rash decision, ill considered. It's not like Beverly
at all. <br>
TROI: I agree, but she does have the right to make that choice, even if
we don't feel it's a good one. <br>
(doorbell) <br>
PICARD: Come. <br>
DATA: Captain, Geordi and I have detected an energy residual with the
same anaphasic signature as the one we found on Ned Quint's body. <br>
PICARD: Where? <br>
DATA: Approximately seventeen kilometres from the centre of the colony,
sir. It is coming from the cemetery. <br>
PICARD: Data, I want you to go down to the cemetery. See if you can
pinpoint the source. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
(Data leaves) <br>
PICARD: In the meantime, I would like to meet with this Ronin.

LAFORGE: The energy readings are coming from this direction, but I
can't get an exact location. I'll try narrowing the scan field. <br>
DATA: The energy readings appear to be originating approximately two
metres below the surface. I believe they are concentrated within this
burial site. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: I'm so glad you're here. I can't imagine
what life was like before I met you. <br>
RONIN: And it will only get better. <br>
(he turns into a green mist and enters her body) <br>
CRUSHER: Oh, Ronin. I had no idea I could feel this way. <br>
RONIN [OC]: We're nearly merged now. As two candles join to form a
single light, so we will flourish as one. <br>
(a knock at the door) <br>
RONIN [OC]: I love you, Beverly. <br>
CRUSHER: I love you. <br>
(another knock, then Picard enters) <br>
PICARD: Beverly? <br>
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc. <br>
PICARD: Sorry I startled you. I knocked but there was no answer. The
door was open. I hope you don't mind. <br>
CRUSHER: What do you want? <br>
PICARD: Well, I'd hoped to meet your new friend, Ronin. <br>
CRUSHER: He's not here. <br>
PICARD: Well, perhaps I could wait, if you don't mind. I'm really
anxious to meet this remarkable young man who swept away not just one,
but two of the Howard women. <br>
CRUSHER: (carrying the candle) Jealousy doesn't suit you, Jean-Luc. <br>
PICARD: Have you changed the colour of your eyes? <br>
CRUSHER: I just grew tired of the other colour. Don't you think it
suits me? <br>
PICARD: I think that I preferred your eyes the way they were before. I
think I preferred you the way you were before, Beverly. <br>
CRUSHER: Well, this is the way I am now. And this is my life. I've made
my decision and I'm not going to change my mind, so please leave me
alone. <br>
PICARD: Oh, no, there's something's wrong here. Now, Beverly, this is
more than just an obsessive love affair that has got out of hand. Tell
me, why is it that no one has seen this Ronin except you? <br>
RONIN: (coming down the stairs) All right, Captain. Here I am. I
believe Beverly asked you to leave her alone. <br>
(Beverly goes to Ronin's side) <br>
PICARD: So, you're Ronin. It's a pleasure to meet you. Where are you
from? <br>
RONIN: Earth. Scotland. <br>
PICARD: How long have you been on Caldos? <br>
RONIN: All that matters is that I'm here now, and that Beverly and I
plan to be together for the rest our lives. <br>
DATA [OC]: Data to Picard. <br>
PICARD: Go ahead, Data. <br>
DATA [OC]: Captain, we have located the source of the energy residual.
It appears to be concentrated within Felisa Howard's coffin. <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain, we'd like permission to exhume the body. <br>
RONIN: You can't do that. Leave her alone. <br>
PICARD: Why not? What are you afraid of? <br>
RONIN: I'm not afraid of anything. But I cannot allow you to desecrate
her grave. <br>
PICARD: Data, ask Governor Maturin's permission to exhume the body.
Picard out. <br>
RONIN: I won't stand for this. I'll go to the Governor myself. <br>
PICARD: Go on. I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't know who you are.
He'll probably have the same questions that I do. How did you get here?
What ship did you come on? <br>
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc, leave him alone. <br>
PICARD: Why don't you answer my questions? What ship? I'd like to look
at the passenger list. Where have you been living here? What's your
position? Who are your neighbours? <br>
(Ronin vanishes) <br>
PICARD: Come on, Beverly, we've got to get out of here. <br>
(Picard touches Beverly and gets zapped by green) <br>
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc. <br>
(Beverly grabs her medical kit) <br>
RONIN [OC]: Beverly, we must stop the others. They cannot exhume the
body. <br>
CRUSHER: We can't just leave him. He might die. <br>
RONIN [OC]: You must come. I am your love. I am the one who will take
care of you. <br>
CRUSHER: I can't just let him die. <br>
RONIN: Beverly, come with me. <br>
CRUSHER: No. No! <br>
RONIN: I'm sorry, I'm going to stop them. <br>
(Ronin leaves) <br>
CRUSHER: Come on, come on. <br>
PICARD: I'm all right. Beverly, go after him. Go to the cemetery. </font></p>

here. <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: Aye, sir. <br>
(the coffin is beamed out of the grave without the pile of soil
collapsing, and they
lift the lid off to reveal a white haired old lady) <br>
DATA: I am reading definite signs of anaphasic energy in her body. It
appears to extend to the cellular level. <br>
LAFORGE: That's impossible. She wasn't anywhere near the weather
station when Quint was killed. She died of natural causes. <br>
DATA: I suggest we run a deep tissue scan to look for any signs of <br>

them) <br>
CRUSHER: No! Ronin, stop this. Stop this, please. <br>
FELISA: Beverly, it's all right. Have trust in me. <br>
CRUSHER: You're not Nana. Nana's dead. Leave her alone! <br>
(green comes out of Felisa and the corpse falls back. Ronin appears.) <br>
RONIN: Beverly! Forgive me. These men were trying to stop us from being
together. Once they're gone, everything will be right. <br>
CRUSHER: No, it won't. You've been infusing me with the same sort of
anaphasic energy that killed Quint. <br>
RONIN: He was trying to destroy me. I had to defend myself. My love. I
could never harm you. I am here to protect you. <br>
CRUSHER: No, you're not. There's no such thing as a ghost. You are some
sort of anaphasic lifeform. Anaphasic energy is extremely unstable. It
needs an organic host in order to maintain molecular cohesion or else
you'll die. Isn't that right? <br>
RONIN: Beverly. <br>
CRUSHER: I also scanned the candle. The flame is plasma based. You were
using it as a receptacle for yourself in order to get to me, in order
to merge with me. You have been using me, Nana, my entire family for
centuries. <br>
RONIN: And I loved all of them! And they loved me. Give me the candle,
Beverly. <br>
CRUSHER: No. No. <br>
(Ronin gives Geordi another zap) <br>
RONIN: Put it down, or I will kill him. Set it down and walk away. <br>
(Beverly puts it down then grabs Geordi's phaser and destroys it) <br>
RONIN: No! <br>
CRUSHER: (into Geordi's comm. badge) Crusher to Riker. Will, close off
all the plasma conduits in the weather control system. I'll explain
later. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Understood. <br>
CRUSHER: You've nowhere left to go. <br>
RONIN: Yes, I do. <br>
CRUSHER: Keep away from me. <br>
(Crusher shoots him) <br>
RONIN: Beverly. I love you. Beverly. <br>

Mister Data have recovered from their exposure to the anaphasic energy,

ancestors had a biochemistry that was compatible with his energy
matrix. I imagine that he took human form and seduced her like he did
me. I was about to be initiated into a very unusual relationship. You
might call it a family tradition. But there's a part of me that's a
little sad. <br>
TROI: How so? <br>
CRUSHER: I re-read the entries in my grandmother's journals. Whatever
else he might have done, he made her very happy. </font> </p>
