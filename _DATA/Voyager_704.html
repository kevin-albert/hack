awakening. Return to that dark place from which all life springs. A
primal energy charges your blood, an energy of rebirth. The mind
awakens and focuses on its task. Pagh'tem'far, b'tanay. Pagh'tem'far,

Lecture hall? <br>
PARIS: Guess again. <br>
TORRES: Opera house? Not another one of the Doctor's performances. <br>
PARIS: This is a movie house. This is the Old Palace Theatre in
Chicago, built in 1932. Look at the detail on that crown moulding. <br>
TORRES: It doesn't look very functional.<br>
PARIS: This place isn't about function, it's about fantasy. <br>(Torres
steps on something sticky.) <br>PARIS: Chewing gum.<br>
TORRES: There is such a thing as too much authenticity. <br>
PARIS: Attention to detail. That's what makes it fun. <br>(They sit.)<br>
TORRES: Protective lenses?<br>
PARIS: These will make the images on the screen appear
three-dimensional. <br>
TORRES: Let me get this straight. You've gone to all this trouble to
programme a three-dimensional environment that projects a
two-dimensional image, and now you're asking me to wear these to make
it look three-dimensional again?<br>
PARIS: Great, isn't it? <br>(The lights go down and film starts - Revenge of the Creature. Paris puts his arm along the back of Torres' seat.) <br>
TORRES: Crick in your neck? <br>
PARIS: People didn't go to the movies just for the movies, you know. <br>
TORRES: Really? What did they go for? <br>
PARIS: I'll try to demonstrate. <br>(They smooch.)<br>

Was Ensign Tabor wearing these when he was found? <br>
TORRES: No, they were on the floor next to him. <br>
PARIS: I don't think they cause comas.<br>
TUVOK: Lights strobing at certain frequencies have been known to induce
seizures. We should analyse the optical properties of this movie. When
was the last time you spoke with Mister Tabor? <br>
PARIS: About ten, fifteen minutes before B'Elanna and I got here. He
called to say the
programme was up and running. <br>
TORRES: Funny. <br>
TUVOK: Lieutenant? <br>
TORRES: When we were in the Maquis together, we used to joke that Tabor
must have had his own personal forcefield. He went through a dozen
firefights without even getting his clothes dirty. <br>
TUVOK: He's still alive. Perhaps his forcefield is holding. <br>
KIM: Commander, I've reviewed the sensor logs for the four hours Tabor
was in here. All systems were operating normally,&nbsp;safeties were
online. <br>
TUVOK: Run a level five diagnostic on the logs. <br>

I've found several microfractures in his cranium. They're minor, but
the pattern suggests he suffered a trauma of some sort. There's also
evidence of subdermal contusions along his right shoulder. <br>

Commander. <br>
TUVOK: Crewman Jor. If I'm not mistaken, your quarters are on deck
four. <br>
JOR: I heard what happened to Tabor. I was looking for a book to bring
to him. <br>
TUVOK: I'm afraid he's in no condition to read. <br>
JOR: I was going to read to him. I've heard it helps sometimes to hear
a familiar voice. <br>
TUVOK: You and Tabor were friends. Do you have any idea why someone
would want to hurt him? <br>
JOR: I can't imagine. <br>
TUVOK: Could you tell me where you were from oh seven hundred to eleven
hundred hours this morning? <br>
JOR: On duty. In Engineering. You can check with Lieutenant Torres if
you like.<br>

Harry's found evidence that someone tampered with the holodeck sensor
logs. Several files have been deleted. <br>
JANEWAY: Any signs of an outside intruder? <br>
CHAKOTAY: No, nothing.<br>
TUVOK: I believe that a member of this crew is responsible. <br>
JANEWAY: Tabor was well-liked. What's the motive? <br>
TUVOK: I have one suspect. Crewman Jor. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I find that hard to believe. I've known her for a long time.
She and Tabor were friends. <br>
TUVOK: Close friends. She had access to his quarters. <br>
CHAKOTAY: A close relationship is hardly a crime. <br>
TUVOK: It is my experience that emotional involvements often lead to
unpredictable behaviour. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's an opinion, not evidence. <br>
TUVOK: There may be other suspects. I intend to question all crew
members who had recent contact with Tabor. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'll check the internal sensors. See what else I can find.
<br>(Chakotay leaves.)<br>
JANEWAY: Commander. You seem awfully convinced that one of the crew was
behind this. Now, you can't tell me that's the only logical conclusion,
because I can think of a number of others. <br>
TUVOK: I realise that my assumptions seem premature, but I have a
strong instinct about this. You might call it a hunch. <br>
JANEWAY: I didn't think that Vulcans had hunches. <br>
TUVOK: I can't explain it, Captain, but I can't ignore it either.
Someone on board is responsible and I intend to find out who it is. </font></p>

JANEWAY: There hasn't been any hostility between the Maquis and the
rest of the crew for years. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe someone on your crew couldn't put the past behind them.

<br><b>[Doctor's office]<br></b></font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: They all have the same disruptions in their synaptic pathways. The
same cranial fractures, contusions. But I still don't know the cause, or
how to reverse it. <br>
JANEWAY: Your investigation? <br>
TUVOK: Nothing conclusive. <br>
JANEWAY: Five crewmen in comas and we don't have a single clue? <br>
TUVOK: The assailant must have access to security protocols. There is
no other way he could have escaped detection. <br>

What is it you expect us to do?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Stay alert. Report anything suspicious to Commander Tuvok. <br>
CHELL: I'd rather report to you, if it's all the same. <br>
CREWMAN: He's right. I've never trusted the Vulcan. He's betrayed us before.<br>
TORRES: He was doing his job.<br>
CREWMAN: He didn't care about the Maquis back then. Why should he now? <br>
TORRES: We're not Maquis anymore. <br>
CREWMAN: Tell that to our friends in Sickbay. <br>
TORRES: Oh, come on. We put our differences aside seven years ago. It's
ancient history. <br>
CHELL: Maybe history is repeating itself. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Look, the truth is, we don't know what we're up against. But
the last thing we need right now is an outbreak of paranoia. Now until we get to
the bottom of this, I want you all to carry hand phasers. Nobody goes
anywhere alone. </font></p>

We thought maybe the intruder left behind some kind of negative image. <br>
KIM: Displaced photons. Tom figured that if we dampen the photonic
ambience and enhance the polarity <br>
TUVOK: We can applaud Mister Paris' ingenuity later. What have you
found? <br>(Kim calls up a shadowy figure on the front row.)<br>TUVOK: Ensign Tabor. <br>
KIM: Now take a look at this. <br>(A second figure appears, bending over Tabor.) <br>
TUVOK: Impressive. <br>
KIM: It doesn’t tell us who the attacker was, but we do know someone
else was here. <br>
TUVOK: Can you extrapolate the assailant's height and weight? <br>
KIM: I’d say between a hundred seventy and a hundred ninety
centimetres. Maybe seventy five kilograms. <br>
PARIS: That describes about half the members of the crew. <br>
KIM: At least we can rule out Naomi Wildman. <br>
TUVOK: Is it possible to increase the resolution? <br>

Stop it. You're making me nervous.<br>
CHELL: It doesn't make sense. This ship, with all its sensors. How
could five people be attacked without leaving a trace? <br>
TORRES: Good question.<br>
CHELL: Maybe it's a conspiracy. Ever since Voyager began sending
datastreams back home, Starfleet has known that almost a quarter of the
crew is Maquis. <br>
TORRES: So? <br>
CHELL: Maybe they think we're still dangerous. Maybe they ordered the
Captain to neutralise the threat. <br>
TORRES: Yes, that's it. She's putting us all into stasis. The comas are
just a cover story. <br>

That'll be all, Crewman. Please send in Mister Kim. <br>(The crewman leaves. Kim enters.)<br>
KIM: I'm still trying to enhance the photon displacement. <br>
TUVOK: I appreciate your efforts, Mister Kim, but I called you here for
another reason. In the last datastream from Earth, you received a
letter from someone named Dennis Kim. <br>
KIM: My cousin. <br>
TUVOK: In that letter, he spoke of your mutual friend, Maxwell Saroyan.
<br>
KIM: You read my mail? <br>
TUVOK: Yes. <br>
KIM: Isn't that a violation of privacy protocols? <br>
TUVOK: As the Chief of Security, I have the authority to suspend those
protocols under special circumstances. <br>
KIM: And what is so special about a letter from my cousin? <br>
TUVOK: The attacks began shortly after we received the last datastream. Your letter was part of that transmission. <br>
KIM: A lot of people got letters. <br>
TUVOK: Twenty eight, to be exact, but only six of them matched the
physical parameters of the photon displacement. <br>
KIM: Am I a suspect? <br>
TUVOK: According to the letter, your friend, Mister Saroyan, was killed
by the Maquis a number of years ago. <br>
KIM: You got me, Tuvok. I confess. I was so distraught after hearing
Max's name that I fired my Captain Proton Comatizer at every Maquis I
could find. <br>
TUVOK: Your sarcasm could be viewed as subterfuge. <br>
KIM: Tuvok, it's me, Harry. Do you really think I'd be capable of this?
<br>
TUVOK: My personal views are irrelevant. <br>
KIM: I learned about Max's death a long time ago. I was upset, but I
don't blame the Maquis, and I certainly don't blame anyone on this
ship. If that'll be all?<br>(Tuvok is lost in thought.)<br>KIM: Is everything all right? <br>
TUVOK: This investigation is perplexing. It defies logic. <br>

thought you might like to have a few words with Mister Tabor. <br>

TABOR: Fine, sir. Hungry. <br>
TUVOK: What do you remember? <br>
TABOR: Not much. I was working in the holodeck, and then I was here. <br>

PARIS: Twenty nine hours. She woke up just before you did. <br>
JANEWAY: They've all recovered. We don't know why. It's Tuvok. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok? <br>
JANEWAY: He's in the brig. Apparently, he's being manipulated by some
form of mind control. Can he leave, Mister Paris? <br>
PARIS: I don't see why not, but he should wear one of these. <br>(The ubiquitous cortical monitor.)<br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Tuvok's son is a mature teenager.)<br>SEK [on
screen]: Exo-linguistics always seemed a little too theoretical to me.
I've decided to study musical composition instead. I would have sent
you my latest polytonal construct, but they wouldn't give me enough
room in this datastream. Maybe next time, I can. <br>
CHAKOTAY: A letter from his son. <br>
JANEWAY: We found another signal embedded in the message. A letter
within a letter. <br>
SEK [on screen]: Hello, Father. We received your last transmission. <br>
TEERO [on screen]: This is a holy time. B'tanay, the time of awakening.
Return to that dark place from which all life springs. <br>
SEVEN: The signal is calibrated to correspond with Vulcan synaptic
frequencies. Tuvok wouldn't have been consciously aware of it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Teero. Teero Anaydis. He was a Bajoran Vedek. He worked with
the Maquis. <br>
JANEWAY: Doing what? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Counter-intelligence. He was thrown out for experimenting
with mind control. He thought it was a good way to recruit agents. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, apparently he was successful at recruiting our Tactical
Officer. These incantations and symbols, they must have triggered
something in Tuvok. Preconditioned behaviour, instructions. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I should've known you'd show up again. <br>
JANEWAY: Commander? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Teero was a fanatic. He'd go to any extreme for the Maquis.
He called the rest of us traitors for rejecting his ideas. Swore he'd
fight the war on his own if he had to. <br>
SEVEN: Why instruct Tuvok to mind meld with Voyager's Maquis thirty
five thousand light years from Earth? <br>
JANEWAY: I'd like Tuvok to take a look at this message. Maybe it'll jog
his memory. (to Seven) Try to decode those symbols. </font></p>

It's him. <br>
JANEWAY: His name is Teero Anaydis. <br>
TUVOK: Teero. <br>
JANEWAY: He worked for Maquis Intelligence. <br>
TUVOK: Yes, I remember meeting him. I was undercover, doing
reconnaissance on a colony near the Badlands. He was a Vedek at the
Bajoran temple there. <br>
JANEWAY: Go on. <br>
TUVOK: We spoke briefly. He was interested in Vulcan culture. That's
all I remember. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe that's all he wanted you to remember. He was developing
some kind of mind control technique. We think he used it on you seven
years ago. <br>(Tuvok has a quick sepia vision of himself.)<br>JANEWAY:&nbsp;What is it?<br>
TUVOK: I, I was restrained. Very frightened. <br>
JANEWAY: What did he do to you? <br>
TUVOK: I can't remember. <br>
JANEWAY: Try. <br>
TUVOK: I can't! <br>(Tuvok curls up in the corner of his cell.)<br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok, if we're going to help you, we need to find out. The
last time you meditated, it helped the memories resurface, didn't it?
You've helped me meditate. I think I've learned a thing or two about
the process. Let me try to guide you. <br>(The forcefield is lowered, and Janeway enters the cell. A short time later, Tuvok is kneeling.) <br>JANEWAY: Where are you? <br>

TEERO: You. You're the perfect subject. <br>
TUVOK: For what?<br>
TEERO: I'm a student of the mind. Yours is remarkable. Disciplined,
orderly. On the surface, that is. Beneath <br>(Teero injects Tuvok.)<br>TEERO: Boiling emotions, repressed
violence. In a sense, you're two different men. One I could never hope
to manipulate, but the other<br>
TUVOK: I have been trained to resist mind control. <br>
TEERO: That's the rational, logical part of you at work, but I want to
reach your inner fire. Your spirit. <br>

you can fight him. You can resist. What does he want? <br>

back in the Brig, Kathryn. <br>
JANEWAY: What's Teero done to you? <br>
CHAKOTAY: He simply helped us remember who we are. We're Maquis. We've
always been Maquis.<br>
