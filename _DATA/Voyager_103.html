Paris is handing over helm to his relief, a Starfleet woman.) <br>
PARIS: Holding course three five one mark one zero, warp seven. We'll
be passing a red dwarf system in forty minutes. I can't tell you if
there are any M-class planets. <br>
(Paris goes over to Harry Kim.) <br>
PARIS: You ready?<br>
KIM: No, I really want to get on that transtator assembly diagnostic.<br>
PARIS: Harry, I can't do this alone.<br>
KIM: I'm sorry.<br>
PARIS: You're making a big mistake. Can't you see what's going to
happen? We're the only humans out here, Harry. People are going to
start pairing off, and if we don't get to the Delany sisters in Stellar
Cartography soon, somebody else will.<br>
KIM: I've got a girl back home.<br>
PARIS: So what? I've got five.<br>
KIM: I plan on seeing mine again.<br>
PARIS: Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry. You really think she's going
to wait for you?<br>
KIM: I hope so.<br>
PARIS: Let her go. Let her have a husband and kids and a good life,
while you and I have the Delany sisters.<br>
KIM: I told you, I need to run a transtator diagnostic.<br>
PARIS: You need to run a self-diagnostic. Look, they come as a pair.
It's a double date or no date. Come on. I told them all about you.<br>
KIM: What did you tell them about me?<br>
PARIS: Well, for one thing, how you broke the single pilot speed record
at the Academy.<br>
KIM: Record. I never broke any record!<br>
PARIS: And who are they going to check it with?<br>
(Something hits Voyager, starting it shaking. Janeway and Neelix
stagger in from the Briefing room.) <br>
JANEWAY: Report!<br>
TUVOK: We're at the leading edge of a shockwave.<br>
(Kes wakes from her sleep and sits upright. The shaking stops.) <br>
KIM: Minor hull breach on deck three. Contained. Shields are holding.<br>
TORRES [OC]: Engineering is undamaged, Captain. All systems operational.<br>
(Paris takes back the helm.) <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Paris, can you identify the source of the wave?<br>
PARIS: I'm not sure. Scanners are picking up a debris cloud in the red
dwarf system we're approaching.<br>
TUVOK: It consists of differentially charged polaric ions, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Differentially charged? That would suggest a massive
detonation. Are you familiar with any intelligent life forms in this
system, Mister Neelix?<br>
NEELIX: Familiar? Not exactly familiar. Considerably less than
familiar, actually.<br>
JANEWAY: Adjust course to investigate.<br>
PARIS: Aye, Captain. <br>
(A short while later, Kes has dressed and enters the Bridge.) <br>
PARIS: Entering the system Captain. Heading zero one zero mark four.
Deflectors at maximum.<br>
NEELIX: Kes, what are you doing here?<br>
KES: I had to know. <br>
NEELIX: Know? Know what?<br>
PARIS: The origin of the shockwave is an M-class planet, Captain. We're
within visual range.<br>
JANEWAY: On screen.<br>
(A grey cratered ball.) <br>
KIM: All vegetation on the planet has been destroyed.<br>
TUVOK: No satellite system in orbit, no evidence of space craft.<br>
JANEWAY: Life signs?<br>
KES: None.<br>
PARIS: None. But the polaric radiation may be interfering with the
scanners.<br>
JANEWAY: Take us into orbit.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Density patterns on the surface show artificial waterways and
a global aqueduct system. There is a civilisation down there, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Or there was. What do we know about surface conditions?<br>
TUVOK: Radiation is within acceptable levels. Atmosphere, breathable.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Paris, Tuvok, you're with me. Miss Torres, meet us in
transporter room two.<br>
TORRES [OC]: On my way.<br>
JANEWAY: Commander, you have the Bridge. </font></p>

away team beam down into the night of a scene of devastation, like the
aftermath of a war. Tuvok puts his phaser away and they all take out
their tricorders.) <br>
TORRES: The entire surface of the planet was just seared.<br>
JANEWAY: There was a chain reaction in subspace, very likely triggered
by the detonation of one or more polaric ion devices.<br>
PARIS: If that's what happened, the people here never had a chance.<br>
TORRES: They're gone. Vaporised. Every organic has basically been
obliterated.<br>
JANEWAY: At least it happened quickly. Polaric detonation would have
swept through this city in seconds.<br>
TUVOK: It recalls the Chaltok Four incident.<br>
TORRES: Chaltok Four?<br>
TUVOK: A Romulan research colony was nearly destroyed during the
testing of one these devices. It lead to the Polaric Test Ban Treaty of
2268.<br>
TORRES: So, we're looking at the end of a war.<br>
PARIS: I wonder who won?<br>
JANEWAY: I'm not so sure there was a war. Look at these readings,
B'Elanna.<br>
TORRES: Polaric ion concentrations are so high I can't get an accurate
reading.<br>
JANEWAY: I'd say these conduits were the source of the explosion,
wouldn't you? <br>
TORRES: A civilisation powered by polaric ion energy?<br>
JANEWAY: That's what it looks like. A time bomb underneath every
street, running into every home. </font></p>

crying.) <br>
NEELIX: What do you mean, you saw it? How could you see it?<br>
KES: I don't know.<br>
NEELIX: What did you see?<br>
KES: I saw them burn. Their bodies ashes where they stood.<br>
NEELIX: You felt the shockwave in your sleep. It's just your
imagination, a strange coincidence.<br>
KES: I don't think so.<br>
NEELIX: What else could it be?<br>
KES: It was almost telepathic.<br>
NEELIX: Telepathy is a message, words, a voice. What you're describing,
why, its almost like the visions of Drakian forest dwellers.<br>
KES: Who?<br>
NEELIX: A tribe with para-normal abilities. They can walk into an empty
room<br>
KES: Neelix. My ancestors were said to have unusual mental abilities.<br>
NEELIX: No one believes those stories.<br>
KES: I always have. </font></p>

takes something round from a ledge. It has a series of numbers in red
LED on it. 401-22-84.) <br>
PARIS: Look. This may be some kind of time piece, stopped at the moment
of the explosion.<br>
(Sunlight and children's voices. Then it is gone.) <br>

TORRES: What? <br>

women go about their business. He is in front of a clock shop. A hand
touches his shoulder and he is back in the gloom again. It was
Janeway.) <br>
PARIS: I don't understand. I was here in this square, but there were
people.<br>
JANEWAY: You never left here, Tom.<br>
PARIS: But I saw them! Lots of people, children playing, and the sun
was shining. There was no evidence of an explosion. Everyone was alive
and happy.<br>
JANEWAY: You were standing here the whole time.<br>
TORRES: Your central nervous system is showing a temporal flux, but
it's rapidly returning to normal.<br>
TUVOK: The chain reaction has shattered subspace, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: I want everyone to stand exactly where they are. If Tuvok's
right, there may be subspace fractures floating like icebergs across
the planet's surface. Away team to Voyager.<br>

JANEWAY: Tuvok! B'Elanna! Janeway <br>
(A young boy starts screaming. A local law officer comes over to him.) <br>
GUARD: Hey, calm down. It's all right. Now, what's the problem?<br>
LATIKA: I saw them. They appeared out of thin air! They're some kind of
demons. I saw them with my own eyes. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry we startled him. We just came around the corner.<br>
LATIKA: They're lying!<br>
GUARD: Shh. Now, calm down. You've been reading too many of those Dark
Storm tales, young fellow. There's no such thing as demons.<br>
LATIKA: But, I'm telling you.<br>
GUARD: Ah, ah, ah! Run along now. Have a confection bar and calm down.
All right everybody, back to your business. Nothing else to see here
now. <br>
(The young boy leaves and the crowd disperses.) <br>
GUARD: Oh, sorry about that. <br>
PARIS: No problem.<br>
GUARD: Who knows what gets into their heads, huh?<br>
JANEWAY: Perhaps the uniform scared him. We're not from this area.<br>
GUARD: Come in on the continental transport? <br>
JANEWAY: This morning.<br>
GUARD: Is, er, that what they're wearing in Kalto province these days?<br>
PARIS: Er, this is a little more formal than most. You know how it is
when you travel.<br>
JANEWAY: We were actually looking for a clothing shop. We thought we'd
change into something more appropriate.<br>
GUARD: There's one right over there. I hope the rest of your stay with
us is more enjoyable.<br>
(The guard leaves them.) <br>
PARIS: I wish I could say it will be.<br>
(He goes to the shop display where the timepiece is counting. 371-20-01
The owner comes out.) <br>
SHOPKEEPER: Need a timepiece?<br>
(The owner opens the display window.) <br>
PARIS: Maybe you could help me. I'm from Kalto Province. I'm not used
to your timepieces.<br>
SHOPKEEPER: They're no different that Kalton pieces.<br>
PARIS: Are you sure? What do these numbers stand for?<br>
SHOPKEEPER: Rotations, intervals, fractions. Same as any timepiece.
Fourteen kalodas.<br>
PARIS: A fair price. I might stop back later, if there's time. <br>
(Paris rejoins Janeway.) <br>
PARIS: If I understood correctly, this world is going to be destroyed
sometime tomorrow. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> First
officers log, supplemental. There's been no sign of Captain Janeway or
Lieutenant Paris since they were lost in a subspace fracture. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>
[Briefing Room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Kim
has got a diagram up on the wall screen.) <br>
KIM: This is one of the subspace fractures we've located with a
magneton scan of the surface. This is the time of the explosion, where
the fracture opens. Then as the shock waves dissipate, the fracture
grows more narrow. We believe that the Captain and Lieutenant Paris are
trapped at the narrow end.<br>
TORRES: Shockwaves from most explosions dissipate into the future, but
we're speculating, based in part on what Paris told us he saw, that
these dissipate into the past.<br>
KIM: That's consistent with the subspace damage we've observed.<br>
TUVOK: Why haven't they been able to return as Mister Paris did the
first time?<br>
TORRES: He wasn't all the way inside a fracture, remember? We still saw
Paris standing there even when he could see the other side.<br>
CHAKOTAY: So it's possible that the Captain and Paris are existing only
hours and minutes before the explosion occurs.<br>
TORRES: There's no way for us to measure exactly how far back these
fractures go.<br>
CHAKOTAY: How do we find them?<br>
TUVOK: If I know Captain Janeway, she would activate a subspace beacon
to assist us.<br>
KIM: We're counting on it. First we have to find a fracture in a
location where they've been. Then we have to microscan the fracture to
try to pick up the signal from their subspace beacon.<br>
TORRES: Once we've identified where and when they re, then we have to
widen the fracture at that point.<br>
TUVOK: How do you suggest we do that?<br>
KIM: We're not sure yet. </font></p>

EMH: Hmm. Hmm, hmm.<br>
NEELIX: What?<br>
EMH: Hmm?<br>
NEELIX: Is something wrong?<br>
EMH: Yes, terribly wrong. Your brain is not on file. Either your
government failed to transmit the standard fifteen five oh one crew
personnel report or somebody at Starfleet Medical really fouled up.<br>
KES: I'm not a member of the Starfleet crew.<br>
NEELIX: We came aboard at mid-expedition.<br>
EMH: And no one asked you for your medical histories when you arrived?
Of course not. That would be the ship's doctor's job. My job, if anyone
had bothered to tell me about new passengers, but I seem to be just
about the last to know about everything around here. So, tell me, just
how many other new arrivals are there?<br>
NEELIX: Just us.<br>
KES: And the crew from another ship that was destroyed.<br>
EMH: Another crew. That's nice. This is the Emergency Medical
Holographic system to Captain Janeway.<br>
NEELIX: She's not on board. She's missing on the surface of a planet.<br>
EMH: Missing. The Captain is missing. It seems I've found myself on the
Voyage of the Damned. Very well. Please advise the highest ranking
officer who is not missing, to see me at his earliest convenience. You
may shut off my programme now.<br>
NEELIX: But you haven't told us anything about her condition. <br>
EMH: She is the healthiest member of her species I've ever seen. The
only member of her species I've ever seen. You have a lovely brain. It
will make a fine addition to our files. I wouldn't worry. If your
species has a history of extraordinary mental abilities, this may
simply be your way of flexing those muscles for the first time. Living
in space requires the body to make a variety of biological adjustments.
This could be a side-effect of that process. Go home. Get a good
night's sleep and drink plenty of fluids.<br>
KES: Fluids? <br>
EMH: Everybody should drink plenty of fluids. Don't leave without
turning me off.<br>
KES: Computer, end programme.<br>

(Janeway and Paris have traded their uniforms for local attire. Some
people are looking at them hanging up in the clothing store display
window.) <br>
JANEWAY: We can assume that Voyager will be looking for a way to reach
us. I'll set my comm. badge to emit a subspace beacon. If they get
close, maybe they'll pick it up. I know.<br>
PARIS: Maybe there's some way that<br>
JANEWAY: Don't even think about it, Tom. The Prime Directive is clear.
We cannot allow our presence to alter this planet's natural course of
events.<br>
PARIS: Even if the natural course of events is annihilation?<br>
JANEWAY: Yeah.<br>
PARIS: My father used to talk at length to us about the Prime
Directive, once a year, like a holiday sermon.<br>
JANEWAY: He considered it the guiding principle of space exploration.<br>
PARIS: To be honest, I tuned out most of his sermons years ago.<br>
JANEWAY: Well, tune back into this one, because I agree with him. You
have no idea what the consequences might be once you involve yourself.<br>
PARIS: The consequences would have to be better than mass destruction.<br>
JANEWAY: You're not to warn these people. That's an order. <br>
(The young boy is back, and staring at them.) <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, god. Come on.<br>
(The boy runs and stops in front of them.) <br>
LATIKA: I know you're lying.<br>
JANEWAY: Young man, we're here on a business trip and we have a lot of
work to do.<br>
LATIKA: The officer told me you came here on the continental transport.<br>
JANEWAY: That's right, we're from Kalto Province.<br>
LATIKA: Yeah? Well I just talked to the transport attendant, He told me
four people came today from Kalto. Two of them were a lot older than
you and they had a child with them.<br>
JANEWAY: Well the attendant was wrong. That was us.<br>
LATIKA: So, where's the child?<br>
PARIS: We ate him, because we are demons and we eat children and I
haven't had my supper yet. <br>
(The boy runs off.) <br>
PARIS: Sorry. I just figured it was the quickest way.<br>
JANEWAY: Let's concentrate on getting out of here.<br>
(Paris examines the energy conduit running along the side of the
plaza.) <br>
PARIS: The same subspace fractures that brought us here might still be
around. If they were caused by a polaric explosion? Is there any way we
could use polaric energy to get us back?<br>
JANEWAY: If we had access to a polaric ion generator, we could modify a
tricorder to emit a polaric field. At the very least it might help us
scan for a fracture.<br>
PARIS: I wonder where these conduits get their power? </font></p>

guards fire rounds into the air to disperse the crowd. Friends help the

switches on a projector that emits a green beam which creates a
mini-wormhole a couple of metres ahead.) <br>
TORRES: This device uses the same polaric energy that destroyed the
planet.<br>
KIM: At intense levels it can open a subspace fracture.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Wide enough for the Captain and Paris to get through?<br>
TORRES: If we can locate them, this is capable of bringing them back.<br>
TUVOK: The logical place to begin would be at the same location they
disappeared.<br>
(Fizz! The green beam stops.) <br>
KIM: Only problem is, at the necessary intensity, the polaric generator
will burn itself out after thirty seconds at best.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Can't we re-initialise the generator and start again?<br>
TORRES: Not at the same location. Once we make an attempt at any given
location, the damage to subspace will make a second attempt impossible.<br>
CHAKOTAY: How do we prevent one of us getting trapped in a fracture?<br>
TORRES: We've modified our tricorders to detect the fractures, and all
of us will be wearing one of these. <br>
(An armband with a box on it.) <br>
TORRES: It puts out an anti-polaric field. It should repel the
fractures when they get within three metres.<br>

PARIS: I just am.<br>
MAKULL: I realise how this must appear to you but I'm just a patriot.<br>
JANEWAY: A patriot?<br>
MAKULL: I sincerely believe polaric energy has the potential to destroy
this entire world.<br>
JANEWAY: And I take it very few people here agree with you.<br>
MAKULL: We have more support since the accident at Markov. We know the
companies are afraid of us. We know they've increased security at all
their plants, but it will not be enough to stop us. We can't wait
another week, we have to move up the schedule. We know they're not
telling us the truth. We have to assume the government sent them. Tell
everyone we begin at four hundred tomorrow.<br>

JANEWAY: You wanted the truth, all right, here's the truth. We're from
the future. Exactly one day in the future.<br>
LATIKA: You mean I was right?<br>
PARIS: We weren't allowed to tell. At least, I thought we weren't.<br>
JANEWAY: In a few hours from now there will be a serious accident on
this world. It will be caused by a polaric detonation. We came here in
an interstellar ship to investigate that explosion. When we arrived, we
were exposed to the polaric radiation. </font></p>

JANEWAY: The explosion had an after-effect that no one expected. It
created fractures in time. We fell through one of those fractures.<br>

us to believe all this? </font></p>

contact me.<br>
TERLA: From the future, of course.<br>

MAKULL: Get the particle injector. <br>
(Terla opens a safe and takes out a hand-sized device.) <br>
MAKULL: Bring them with us. The boy, too. I have an idea how they can
help. <br>
(Terla puts the comm. badges on the table and they all leave. The
wormhole opens.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PARIS:
I don't get it, Captain, this morning you were giving orders about not
interfering because of the Prime Directive, and now you're telling them
everything.<br>
JANEWAY: I told them the truth when I realised we'd already violated
the Prime Directive in the worst possible manner.<br>
PARIS: How did we do that?<br>
JANEWAY: Just by being here. Because if we hadn't been here it's very
possible this world would not have been destroyed.<br>
PARIS: What?<br>
JANEWAY: Think about it, Tom. Before we got involved, these people were
planning to commit some kind of sabotage next week. We were the ones
who forced a change in their schedule. Because of us, they decided to
begin today at four hundred rotations, and we know the detonation takes
place today at just after four hundred and one .<br>
PARIS: Four oh one twenty two eighty four. Wait a minute. You're saying
we're responsible for an explosion even though it occurred before our
ship arrived here.<br>
JANEWAY: We've travelled back to a point in time before the explosion,
so, yes, we can be responsible for it.<br>
PARIS: Let's say we never came, and their plans didn't change. Wouldn't
the accident simply have occurred next week instead of today?<br>
JANEWAY: Who knows what might have happened between now and then. They
could have been arrested before they got a chance to carry it out,
conditions at the plant might not have been the same next week. But
it's become our problem now, Tom, and we have got to find a way to
solve it. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
We're running out of time. The subspacefractures are closing. We've
lost over seventy percent of them.<br>
TORRES: At this point we're suggesting we concentrate our search at the
flash-point.<br>
TUVOK: May I ask what you expect to accomplish by doing that?<br>
KIM: We figure the Captain and Paris might have looked for the origin
of the explosion to try and prevent it.<br>
TUVOK: Unlikely. It would be a highly questionable decision in light of
the Prime Directive.<br>
CHAKOTAY: If it were me, I would have tried to get there.<br>
TUVOK: The issue is whether Captain Janeway would go there, not you,
Commander.<br>
CHAKOTAY: You think you can locate the flash-point?<br>

Your job is to get us past the guards. You'll tell them you're bringing
us here to negotiate a settlement of our dispute with the power company.<br>

MAKULL: Think before you say no. Terla has a weapon trained on the boy.
If shooting begins he'll be the first victim.<br>
(The aggressive guard comes out to meet them.) <br>
GUARD: Is there something I can do for you?<br>
MAKULL: She's a government representative on official business.<br>
(Janeway steps up to the guard.) <br>
JANEWAY: I am a hostage. These men are here to break into the plant.<br>
(The guard backs away, so Makull shoots him. Latika tries to get away.
Paris gets between Terla and the boy, and Terla shoots him in the side.
While Janeway and Latika go to Paris, Makull and Terla shoot at the
guard post and break into the power plant.) <br>
MAKULL: Their lives are on your conscience, Janeway!<br>
LATIKA: You saved my life. <br>

detonating some kind of device.<br>
MAKULL: We're not stupid enough to blow up anything here.<br>
JANEWAY: That may be true, but something will go wrong.<br>
MAKULL: Nothing is going to go wrong unless you fire that weapon near a
polaric conduit. For everyone's safety, I suggest you put it down.<br>

CHAKOTAY: If Kes is right, the Captain was here at the moment the
explosion occurred. Is there anyway to break through subspace a few
minutes before the detonation?<br>
KIM: If the widest point of the fracture represents the time of the
explosion, couldn't we open a hole just before the widest point?<br>
TORRES: There's no way we could pin-point the exact time we'd be
penetrating but we could make an educated guess.<br>
TUVOK: I feel it is my duty to point out there is absolutely no logical
reason to believe Kes is correct. However, since I have no alternative
course of action to recommend at this time, I suggest we proceed.<br>

no indications of space craft in the vicinity. It appears to be a
