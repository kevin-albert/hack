ORDERLY: No, he does have a sensor. It's not working. <br>(A wall sensor stops the visitor.)<br>
ALLOCATOR: Negative for dysplasia, viremia, necrobiosis. Please extend
your arms. Species, Dralian. Identity, Gar. TC fifteen. You may
proceed. <br>(The mammalian biped walks up to a chubby faced humanoid.)<br>
GAR: Chellick. Lucky I caught you.<br>
CHELLICK: Mister Gar. I wish I had time to talk.<br>
GAR: Well, all you have to do is listen. I have a new supply of
cytogenics.<br>
CHELLICK: Your last supply was useless. Expired lots, diluted samples. <br>
GAR: Oh, I have something special this time.<br>
CHELLICK: The latest in substandard technology, no doubt. <br>
GAR: Oh, this item is far from substandard. And as a gesture of
goodwill, I'm offering it to you first.<br>
CHELLICK: We don't need another neural monitor. <br>
GAR: This is much more sophisticated than that.<br>
CHELLICK: I'm sure it has some ingenious use but I'm not interested. <br>(Gar activates the mobile emitter.)<br>
EMH: Please state the nature of the medical emergency? Where have you
taken me?<br>
GAR: It's a holographic construct programmed with over five million
medical protocols. <br>
EMH: I demand to be returned to Voyager at once. <br>
CHELLICK: What's Voyager? <br>
EMH: The Federation Starship to which I'm assigned. This man is a
kidnapper. <br>
GAR: I would never offer you stolen property. I traded warp-grade
dilithium for this
programme. <br>
CHELLICK: What's your price? <br>
EMH: This negotiation is pointless. I'm not about to perform medical
services for a pair of common thieves. <br>
CHELLICK: It doesn't seem to be in working order. <br>
ALLOCATOR: Trauma victims are now arriving at Emergency Intake Seven. <br>
CHELLICK: What caused their injuries? <br>
ALLOCATOR: A generator explosion at the Gammadan mining facility.<br>
GAR: You'd better start cooperating, or I will dismantle your
programme and sell it off one subroutine at a time. <br>
EMH: When Captain Janeway discovers what you've done<br>
ORDERLY: Come on, let's go. Clear a path. Here we go. Tuck him in there. <br>ORDERLY 2: We haven't got any coagulants.<br>
VOJE: Somebody check the reserves. <br>
ORDERLY: There are no reserves. <br>
VOJE: This one's got grade four pulmonary burns.&nbsp;<br>
ALLOCATOR: Patient's TC is four. Transfer to level green. <br>
VOJE: Green isn't equipped for this. <br>
CHELLICK: His TC's only four. Take him to Green. <br>
EMH: Don't touch that. This patient's bleeding seriously. He needs an
immediate infusion. <br>
VOJE: What are you doing? Get away from him. <br>
EMH: With technology this primitive you may as well be using leeches.<br>
VOJE: Who is this man?<br>
CHELLICK: A Doctor, of sorts. I thought you were withholding your
services. <br>
EMH: Fortunately for these patients, I am programmed with the
Hippocratic Oath. It requires me to treat anyone who's ill. This
patient needs twenty milligrams anesthizine. Get me a hypospray.

our juvenile holoprogrammes. <br>

It's a replicated fake. <br>

JANEWAY: I want someone to tell me how this snake oil salesman managed
to evade every security protocol on the ship. <br>
TUVOK: I take full responsibility. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm not interested in fault. I just want to know how it
happened. <br>
NEELIX: Ah, Gar spend the night in Sickbay. He claimed to have gotten
food poisoning at dinner. <br>
CHAKOTAY: He had plenty of time to learn about the mobile emitter from
the Doctor. <br>
JANEWAY: Who I'm sure was more than willing to extol its virtues. <br>
TORRES: Medical logs show the training file was activated just before
Gar left Voyager. <br>
JANEWAY: Scan for his ion trail. And lets review safeguards for
accessing low-security files, shall we, Mister Tuvok? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">NEELIX:
Captain, don't blame Tuvok for what happened. It was my fault. <br>
JANEWAY: How so? <br>
NEELIX: Gar kept complaining how bland his dinner was so I added a few
exotic spices. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm not sure I see your point. <br>
NEELIX: I was trying so hard to create something he liked that I didn't
take his alien physiology into account. Everyone's assuming he faked
his illness but I might have really made him sick. <br>
JANEWAY: It's not as if your cooking turned him into a thief. <br>
NEELIX: No. But if he hadn't gone to Sickbay, he may never have come up
with a plan to kidnap the Doctor, much less have the opportunity to do
it. <br>
JANEWAY: In my experience, Neelix, men like Gar have no trouble finding
opportunities to take advantage of other people. <br>
NEELIX: I just hope there's something I can do to help find the Doctor.

That was the most impressive cortical bypass I've ever seen. <br>
EMH: It's just a question of possessing the basic skills. <br>
VOJE: If I had basic skills like yours, they'd move me up to Level
Blue. Take this patient to Yellow. <br>
EMH: You seem a little low on resources here. If I could contact my
medical staff, I might be able get you some additional supplies. <br>
VOJE: Communication is usually restricted but the Allocator might give
you clearance. <br>
EMH: Good. Where can I find him? <br>
VOJE: The Allocator isn't a him. It's our main computer. <br>
EMH: Well, perhaps it could establish a communications link with
Voyager's main computer. <br>
VOJE: You'll have to submit a formal request to Chellick and support it
with form eight three W in triplicate. Even then. <br>(A man is coughing a lot.)<br>
EMH: Why hasn't this patient been treated yet?<br>
TEBBIS: He's waiting for proton imaging. There are a lot of other
people ahead of him. <br>
EMH: It's nice to see someone knows what's going on. What's your name? <br>
TEBBIS: Tebbis. <br>
EMH: Well, Tebbis, this doesn't look too serious. <br>
TEBBIS: It's just a little osteal extravasation. <br>
EMH: Excellent diagnosis. <br>
TEBBIS: I hope to be a doctor someday. <br>
EMH: Really? Well, I hope your working conditions are better than
these. <br>
TEBBIS: It wouldn't be so bad if they'd let us listen to music. <br>
EMH: It would certainly improve my mood. <br>
TEBBIS: It's not just that. Music has great healing power. <br>
EMH: I couldn't agree with you more. <br>(They return to the coughing man.)<br>VOJE: Exhale slowly. <br>
EMH: Can't you give him a neural blocker? <br>
VOJE: He's already had his allocation. <br>
EMH: The leg injury isn't all I'm picking up. He's got some kind of
systemic disease. <br>
VOJE: It's a chromo-viral infection. We have twelve cases down here.
He's in the final stage. <br>
EMH: Is there an established treatment? <br>
VOJE: Cytoglobin injections. <br>
EMH: These scans don't show any cytoglobin in his bloodstream. <br>
VOJE: He hasn't been given any.<br>
EMH: Why not?<br>
VOJE: He doesn't have a high enough TC. <br>
EMH: TC? What's that? <br>
CHELLICK: Ah, there you are. I'm happy to report that I've acquired
your programme
from Gar. Please come with me. <br>
EMH: I will not. May I remind you I'm being illegally detained, or
hasn't the rule of law reached this society yet? <br>
CHELLICK: We follow the Allocator's rules. And it's determined that
your services are required on Level Blue. <br>
VOJE: Please, Doctor. The Allocator knows which patients need help the
most. </font></p>

the turbolift shows that Level Blue is the smallest and topmost level.
Green is next, then Yellow. Red is the biggest and White is at the
bottom.)<br>EMH:
Level Blue is your critical care area, I presume. <br>
CHELLICK: Level Blue is the area where it's most critical that we
provide excellent care.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Plenty of space, quiet, carpets.)<br>CHELLICK:
These patients will be your chief responsibility from now on. Do
whatever you can to make them well. <br>
EMH: Why are these patients getting preferential treatment? <br>
CHELLICK: They have a higher TC than the others. <br>
EMH: Indulge me. What's TC? <br>
CHELLICK: Treatment Coefficient. The Allocator assigns one to every
patient. It determines the level of care they receive. <br>
EMH: How is this coefficient derived? <br>
CHELLICK: Through a complex formula that involves profession, skills,
accomplishments. <br>
EMH: How is any of that relevant to medical treatment? <br>
CHELLICK: An agricultural engineer is obviously more important than a
waste processor. <br>
EMH: Important to whom? <br>
CHELLICK: Society. When your resources are limited, you have to
prioritise.<br>
EMH: So you base treatment on whether patients have particular
abilities? <br>
CHELLICK: It's much more complicated than that. The Allocator assesses
the entire individual. <br>
EMH: And reduces his life to a number. <br>
CHELLICK: It may seem impersonal, but it's what the Dinaali have
contracted us to do. <br>
DYSEK: Chellick's people are known throughout the sector for their
administrative skills. Before they came here, we were a dying race.
Eco-disasters, famine. <br>
CHELLICK: Doctor Dysek, Chief of Medicine. The medical hologram I told
you about. <br>
EMH: Are you in charge of what passes for care on Level Red? Because
those people are suffering. <br>
DYSEK: Intriguing technology. Can we use him to treat patients yet? <br>
CHELLICK: That's what he's here for. <br>
EMH: In some societies, it's considered rude to refer to someone in the
third person while he's standing in front of you. <br>
CHELLICK: I'm sure you'll make good use of him. </font></p>

TUVOK: It's emitting a false warp signature. <br>
JANEWAY: Looks we've underestimated Mister Gar again. <br>
PARIS: Now what?<br>
TUVOK: There may be another way to find him. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What do you have in mind? <br>
TUVOK: He traded us high-grade iridium, which has a very brief
half-life. His ship is slow. Logic suggests he acquired the substance
within a radius of three light years. <br>
JANEWAY: Cross-reference our sensor logs and long range scans. <br>
KIM: Two planets, no atmosphere or technology, a T class nebula. Here's
something. An asteroid with approximately two hundred humanoid
lifesigns. Subterranean structures. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Sounds like a mining operation. <br>
TUVOK: If that's where Mister Gar acquired the iridium, they may be
able to help us find him. <br>
JANEWAY: Tom, how fast can you get us there? <br>
PARIS: Less than two hours. <br>
JANEWAY: Do it. <br>(They arrive at the asteroid.)<br>TUVOK:
We're being hailed. <br>
JANEWAY: Open a channel. <br>
MINER [on viewscreen]: I want my iridium back now. <br>
JANEWAY: I beg your pardon?<br>
MINER [on viewscreen]: I've scanned your ship. I know you've got it on
board. <br>
JANEWAY: Yes. We obtained it from a man called Gar. A merchant <br>
MINER [on viewscreen]: You mean thief. <br>
CHAKOTAY: So you have had the pleasure of meeting him. <br>
MINER [on viewscreen]: He was here two days ago. He sold us three
thousand induction units. He was gone a day before we realised he'd
also stolen twenty kilos of ore. <br>
JANEWAY: We had a similar experience. Maybe we can help each other. <br>
MINER [on viewscreen]: How?<br>
JANEWAY: Do you have any idea where we might find him?<br>
MINER [on viewscreen]: Will you return my iridium? <br>
JANEWAY: By all means, but Gar only traded us half of what he stole
from you. However, we might be able to get the rest of it back. <br>
MINER [on viewscreen]: All I can tell you is that the induction units
came from a planetoid called Velos. </font></p>

EMH: Your surgical technique is impressive. <br>
DYSEK: Well. you've obviously had experience with cellular repair. <br>
EMH: As a matter of fact, I've done extensive research on the subject.
I'd be happy to share it with you, but we'll have to contact Voyager to
get it. <br>
DYSEK: You'll have to discuss that with Chellick. He authorises all
communications. It's time for this patient's next injection. <br>

ALLOCATOR: One cytoglobin injection authorised.<br>
EMH: Does this patient have a chromo-viral infection? <br>(The nurse injects the woman on the bed.)<br>
DYSEK: No. Why? <br>
EMH: I was told cytoglobin is the standard treatment for that disease. <br>
DYSEK: Cytoglobin also prevents arterial aging. <br>
NURSE: Will that be all? <br>
DYSEK: You may go. <br>
EMH: This patient's arteries appear to be healthy. <br>
DYSEK: At the moment. But daily injections increase life expectancy up
to forty percent. We prescribe them for all Level Blue patients. <br>
EMH: I just saw a boy on Level Red who's dying. This medicine could
save his life. <br>
DYSEK: This woman is a chief engineer of an irrigation facility which
provides water to half the subcontinent. <br>
EMH: So her life is more valuable? <br>
DYSEK: Keeping her healthy contributes to our survival. Can you say the
same for the boy on Level Red? <br>
EMH: Who knows what he'll accomplish if he has the chance. <br>
DYSEK: If he becomes more valuable to society, his TC will rise, and
then he'll receive better treatment. <br>
EMH: He may not be around long enough. <br>
DYSEK: I'm sorry he's sick, but our society is much better off since we
began following the Allocator's protocols.<br>

VOJE: Not well. <br>(The EMH scans the boy.)<br>
EMH: His condition's deteriorated so rapidly. <br>
VOJE: His coenzyme allotment's been reduced. <br>
EMH: Are we here to help these people, or kill them? <br>
VOJE: His TC is just too low. <br>

VOJE: That's not possible. <br>
EMH: If it's purely a function of statistics, we can simply input more
data. <br>
VOJE: We're not authorised to do that.<br>
EMH: Voje, when you look at your patient lying there, you have to ask
yourself what can I do? What must I do? We can amend his database to
include additional skills. <br>
VOJE: Such as? <br>
EMH: His extensive knowledge of neutronics. <br>
VOJE: He doesn't know anything about neutronics. <br>

Three of the patients we injected are practically virus free. <br>
EMH: What did you expect? <br>
VOJE: Maybe we could reallocate other medications. Treat more patients.

EMH: Now you're thinking like a doctor. And to support your efforts,
I've arranged for resources from Level Blue to be diverted here on a
regular basis. <br>
VOJE: How did you manage that? <br>
EMH: Let's just say Doctor Dysek and I have developed a professional
rapport. Sometimes I even surprise myself. <br>
VOJE: We may actually make these people better. <br>
EMH: That feeling you get from healing someone. Infectious, isn't it? <br>(They go to Tebbis' bed.)<br>
VOJE: Where did you get that? <br>
TEBBIS: One of the technicians was going to recycle it because it
wasn't working, but I think I fixed it. <br>(It is a hand-held medical scanner.)<br>
EMH: It seems to be in good condition, and so do you. You'll be well
enough to leave soon. <br>
TEBBIS: Couldn't you say I'm still sick? <br>
EMH: Don't you want to go home? <br>
TEBBIS: If I do, they'll send me to work in the refinery with my
father. <br>
EMH: What about school? Your medical training? <br>
TEBBIS: I would never be authorised for that. <br>
VOJE: He's right. <br>
TEBBIS: If I stay here, you can teach me, and I can help you treat your
patients. <br>

GAR [on viewscreen]: I thought we were friends, Captain. Why am I being
treated this way? I think I deserve better. <br>
JANEWAY: Where's our doctor? <br>
GAR [on viewscreen]: I have no idea. I certainly hope nothing's
happened to him. <br>
TUVOK: Scans are complete. Neither the mobile emitter nor the Doctor's

are aboard Gar's ship. <br>
GAR [on viewscreen]: Well, of course they're not. <br>

more specific. <br>
EMH: His name was Tebbis, Patient R twelve. <br>
CHELLICK: Acute chromo-viral disease. <br>
EMH: He was recovering. <br>
CHELLICK: Apparently, he developed complications. <br>
EMH: What kind of complications? <br>
CHELLICK: A secondary infection. It spread rapidly.<br>
EMH: How was it treated?<br>
CHELLICK: It wasn't. The patient had exceeded his medication allotment.
It seems someone had given him unauthorised injections. Did you think I
wouldn't find out? <br>
EMH: Don't you have any ethical standards?<br>
CHELLICK: You are hardly in a position to speak to me of ethics. Lying,
stealing. Any other crimes you wish to confess? <br>

CHELLICK: And I am trying to save a society. Do you really think
Patient R twelve is going to help me do that? <br>
EMH: His name was Tebbis. <br>
CHELLICK: He wasn't contributing. He was a drain on resources. <br>
EMH: You're not just rationing health care here. You're getting rid of
the sick and the weak. <br>
CHELLICK: If the boy had been fit, he would have survived. <br>
EMH: Why don't you just put a phaser to their heads? <br>
CHELLICK: We're healers, not killers. <br>
EMH: I'm going to expose you. <br>
CHELLICK: To whom, the people who employ me? They brought me here to
make the hard choices they don't want to make. From now on, I'm
restricting you to Level Blue. You've done enough damage on Red. <br>
EMH: You mean those patients that I treated? Yes, that was
inconsiderate of me. <br>
CHELLICK: It was. You managed to exceed their annual medication
allotment in a matter of days. They're being sent home. <br>
EMH: They'll die. <br>
CHELLICK: You should have considered the consequences of your actions. <br>
EMH: Please, don't make them suffer for my mistakes. It won't happen
again. <br>
CHELLICK: I'm making certain of that. From now on, your time will be
strictly regulated. <br>
EMH: Meaning what? <br>
CHELLICK: I've interfaced your holomatrix with the Allocator. Starting
now, it will determine where you go, when you go and what you do when
you get there. <br>

GAR: The last time I saw him he was in your Sickbay.<br>

be extracted. <br>
GAR: How? <br>
TUVOK: A mind meld. <br>

TUVOK: An invasive and disturbing procedure. <br>
NEELIX: Dinnertime! <br>
TUVOK: Mister Neelix, I am in the middle of an interrogation.<br>
NEELIX: Commander, you know better than anyone that Starfleet has
strict guidelines about allowing prisoners to eat. <br>
TUVOK: Very well. I'll wait. <br>(Neelix enters the cell.)<br>
NEELIX: There we are. I'm glad to see you enjoying a meal. When you got
sick last time I thought my food was to blame, until I realised it was
just a ruse for you to get close to the Doctor. I used Talaxian
Wormroot as the base. I'm glad you like it. Some people react badly. <br>(Gar feels unwell.)<br>
GAR: React how?<br>
NEELIX: Oh, dear, I hope you're not getting sick. If it's the wormroot,
it's going to get a lot worse. <br>
GAR: What have you done to me?<br>
NEELIX: The usual symptoms are abdominal spasms, which increase in
severity for thirty hours. Forty at the most.<br>
TUVOK: Tuvok to Sickbay.<br>
NEELIX: Don't worry Mister Tuvok, it's not fatal. It's horribly
unpleasant, but there's an antidote. <br>
GAR: Then give it to me. <br>
NEELIX: Unfortunately, our doctor is the only one authorised to
administer it. Maybe if you remembered where he was? <br>(Tuvok takes Neelix aside.)<br>
TUVOK: Mister Neelix, have you deliberately poisoned this man? <br>
NEELIX: Relax. He's just having gas pains.<br>
TUVOK: Your actions are not only against regulations <br>
NEELIX: Didn't I hear someone threaten a mind meld? <br>
TUVOK: I was merely trying to encourage the suspect to be more
forthcoming. <br>

Patient B three. The medical hologram has one minute to treat Patient B
three. <br>(The EMH appears next to that patient, and walks back to Voje.)<br>
EMH: You have to help me. <br>
VOJE: Twelve patients on Level Red are being sent home because of you. <br>
EMH: That's why we have to hurry. We may still be able to save them. <br>
VOJE: You've already endangered my patients and now you're asking me to
risk my career? Why should I help you?<br>
EMH: Because I have a plan to heal those patients. That's what doctors
do. We heal. So choose. What kind of doctor are you going to be? <br>
ALLOCATOR: The medical hologram has thirty seconds to deactivation. <br>
EMH: Do you hear that? <br>
VOJE: How can I get you off this level? <br>

CHELLICK: You're only making things worse for yourself. <br>
EMH: As a matter of fact, I'm making things worse for you. I'm going to
make you a patient in your own hospital.<br>
CHELLICK: What was in that injector? <br>
EMH: A neural blocker combined with the same virus that afflicted
Tebbis. <br>

twelve? Maybe this will jog your memory. (The EMH pushes Chellick's bed to the wall scanner.)<br>

CHELLICK: This is ridiculous. I'm not Tebbis! <br>
EMH: But the Allocator thinks you are. <br>
VOJE: How did you <br>
EMH: Simple, the Allocator identifies patients by reading blood
factors. I altered Chellick's by injecting him with antigens from
Tebbis. Now, why don't we see if we can get your condition treated?
Requesting one cytoglobin injection for Patient R twelve. <br>
ALLOCATOR: Treatment denied.<br>
CHELLICK: I order you to medicate me now. <br>
EMH: Ordinarily, I would. But if the Allocator says no. <br>
CHELLICK: Is this some sort of revenge? <br>
EMH: Not revenge. Leverage. I want enough cytoglobin to cure every
infected patient on this level. <br>
CHELLICK: We don't have an adequate supply. <br>
