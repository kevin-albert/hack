bottle of champagne, which she breaks against the railing around the
warp core.)<br>JANEWAY: Ladies and gentlemen, please. May I introduce the next
generation of instellar propulsion, the Quantum Slipstream Drive. Four
years, two months, eleven days. That's precisely how long Voyager's
been in the Delta Quadrant. During that time we've advanced the
frontiers of exploration, and more importantly, we've survived. Now
it's time to go home. Enjoy the celebration but keep in mind we've
still got a lot of work to do before tomorrow's flight. Go easy on that
champagne, Lieutenant. <br>(Strolling with Chakotay.)<br>
JANEWAY: Quantum Matrix, benamite crystals, Borg technology. Can you
imagine what Starfleet is going to say? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't think we'll hear any complaints. The Federation's
first Slipstream drive. They'll probably nominate us for the Cochrane
Medal of Honour. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll start working on my acceptance speech. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'd like to thank the Borg Collective. <br>
JANEWAY: Dinner plans? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Nothing special. Date with a replicator. <br>
JANEWAY: Cancel it, that's an order. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain.<br>
NEELIX: Lieutenant. Lieutenant! Excuse me. My contribution to the
Slipstream Drive. <br>
TORRES: Thanks. What is it? <br>
NEELIX: A Talaxian fur fly. An old spacefaring tradition among my
people. If one of these creatures stowed away on your ship, it was a
sign of good fortune. I had this little fellow preserved. He hung in my
engine room for six years. <br>
TORRES: Cute. <br>
TUVOK: Mister Neelix, you are an unending source of astonishment. <br>
NEELIX: Why, thank you, Mister Vulcan. <br>
EMH: Seven? &nbsp;<br>(Seven is staring at the back of her hand.)<br>
SEVEN: My visual processors and motor cortex. They are malfunctioning. <br>
EMH: Sounds like a problem with your cortical implant. We'd better have
a look. Hold still. <br>
SEVEN: I cannot comply. <br>
EMH: You're intoxicated. <br>
SEVEN: Impossible. <br>
EMH: Your blood synthehol level is point zero five percent. How many
glasses of champagne did you consume? <br>
SEVEN: One. <br>
EMH: Obviously the Borg can't hold their liquor. Come to Sickbay. I'll
give you some inaprovaline to counteract the effects. <br>
SEVEN: I was simply trying to perfect my social skills as you
instructed me to do. <br>
EMH: And you're doing a fine job. <br>
SEVEN: You have always been of enormous assistance to me, Doctor. You are my mentor. <br>
EMH: Yes. <br>
SEVEN: We are as one. We are as one. <br>
KIM: Did you see that? <br>
PARIS: Hmm? <br>
KIM: I think our drone did a little too much celebrating. Speaking of
which, when are you going to join the party? <br>
PARIS: In a minute. <br>
KIM: You're running a warp core diagnostic now? <br>
PARIS: Harry, I think we built an Edsel. <br>
KIM: A what? <br>
PARIS: A lemon. A disaster waiting to happen! I ran a simulation last
night and I discovered a point four two phase variance in the
slipstream threshold. <br>
KIM: Point four two? So it'll be a bumpy ride. We've flown through
worse. <br>
PARIS: If we get knocked out of that slipstream mid-flight it could
overload the quantum matrix. <br>
KIM: Did you tell the Captain? <br>
PARIS: Not yet. Didn't want to spoil the festivities until I was sure. <br>
KIM: Tom, if it'll make you feel better, we'll go to the holodeck right
now, run a few more simulations. It's probably just a sensor glitch. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[2375

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PARIS:
We're at full impulse. <br>
KIM: Engaging Slipstream Drive. Quantum field is stable, deflector at
maximum. <br>
PARIS: Slipstream velocity in four, three, two. Power output is steady.
Quantum field is holding. <br>
KIM: Shields down to seventy three percent. <br>
PARIS: Looking good. Keep that deflector aligned and we should be <br>
KIM: We've got a phase variance. Point one, point two. <br>
PARIS: Remodulate the deflector. <br>
KIM: No effect. Point four. <br>
PARIS: I'm shutting down the drive. <br>
KIM: No, wait. I want to try to invert the Quantum field. <br>
PARIS: It's no use, the slipstream is collapsing. Inertial dampers are
offline. <br>
COMPUTER: Warning. Hull breach on deck ten. <br>
KIM: We're losing structural integrity. <br>
PARIS: Computer, freeze programme! <br>
KIM: One more time. I think if we reroute emergency power to the
deflector a little earlier<br>
PARIS: It won't help. <br>
KIM: Computer, restart simulation at time index <br>
PARIS: Computer, belay that order. It's no use, Harry. <br>
KIM: We can't just give up. <br>
PARIS: Twenty three simulations, twenty three catastrophes. This is no
sensor glitch. We've got to tell them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[2375

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
That can't be right. We tested this engine molecule by molecule. <br>
PARIS: I'm sorry, B'Elanna. <br>
SEVEN: I wish to examine the results of the simulation. <br>
PARIS: Holodeck two. Run them for yourself. That is, if you don't mind
being vaporised a few dozen times. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I looked at their findings, Captain. If we try to take that
flight in the morning, we'll be in escape pods by afternoon. <br>
TUVOK: It would appear we have no choice but to cancel it. <br>
PARIS: Either that or, we can try it Harry's way. <br>
JANEWAY: Ensign? <br>
KIM: I've got an idea. It's tricky, but I think it could work. The
trouble begins about seventeen seconds into the flight. The phase
variance kicks in and the Slipstream becomes unstable. What we need is
someone in a shuttle to ride the rapids in front of Voyager. <br>
TORRES: Yes. They could map the threshold of the Slipstream as it's
forming and send the phase corrections back to us. That is a great
idea, Harry. <br>
KIM: Now, here's the tricky part. The shuttle will only be a couple of
seconds ahead of Voyager. That doesn't give auto-navigation much time
to compensate. <br>
JANEWAY: Tom? <br>
PARIS: Couple of seconds? <br>
KIM: We can do this, Captain. Put me on that shuttle. I'll get Voyager
through the Slipstream. What choice do we have? Take the drive offline?
Months of work for nothing? <br>
TUVOK: We built a highly experimental piece of technology. There were
bound to be setbacks. <br>
KIM: The benamite crystals at the heart of this engine have already
started to decay. It could take years to synthesise more. I don't know
about the rest of you, but I didn't do all this work just to be stopped
by a point four two phase variance. No offence, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: None taken. All right, Mister Kim. You've convinced me.
Prepare a flight plan and have it on my desk within the hour. <br>
KIM: Yes, ma'am. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll let you know what I decide. </font></p>

CHAKOTAY: Famished, but I assumed you called me here to talk about the
Slipstream flight. <br>
JANEWAY: No reason to cancel our dinner plans. I've programmed a dish
my grandmother used to make back on Earth. Vegetable biryani. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Sounds delicious. I didn't know you could cook. <br>
JANEWAY: Normally, I draw the line at a pot of coffee, but tonight is a
special occasion. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Oh? <br>
JANEWAY: Our last night in the Delta Quadrant. I'd say that's special
enough. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You've made your decision. <br>
JANEWAY: We launch tomorrow at oh eight hundred. You and Harry will
take the Delta Flyer. Voyager will be right behind you. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The crew will be pleased. <br>
JANEWAY: You can give them the news yourself, after dessert. What about
you, Chakotay? What do you think about my decision? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I've analysed Harry's flight plan. The theory is sound, but
there are just too many variables. If something goes wrong in that
slipstream<br>
JANEWAY: It could be our only chance to use the Quantum Drive. <br>
CHAKOTAY: True, but if you showed this data to any Starfleet engineer,
they'd think we were out of our minds. We can find another way home.
We've waited this long. <br>
JANEWAY: Long enough. We've waited long enough. I know it's a risk,
probably our biggest one yet, but I'm willing to take it. Are you with
me? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Always. <br>
JANEWAY: Speaking of risks. Are you ready to try some home cooking? <br>

Fifteen years? <br>
KIM: Give or take a few weeks. <br>
EMH: Where are we? <br>
CHAKOTAY: In the Takara sector, just outside the Alpha quadrant. <br>
EMH: The crew? <br>
KIM: Except for us, dead. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We think Captain Janeway tried to make an emergency landing
on this planet. The ship must have been too heavily damaged. They were
all killed on impact. <br>
KIM: They've been buried inside a glacier for the past fifteen years. <br>(Now
they are taking off their thermal suits, we get a look at the older Kim
and Chakotay. Chakotay's hair has long silver streaks at the temples.
Kim has just a few strands of silver. Their hair styles are subtly
different, too.)<br>
EMH: You two were here, on the Delta Flyer, ahead of Voyager. You made
it. <br>
KIM: All the way back to Earth. We got home, Doc, and all it took was
killing everyone we cared about. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Harry! <br>
EMH: Starfleet certainly took their time finding us. <br>
KIM: Starfleet. Starfleet gave up their search for Voyager over nine
years ago. We had to find you on our own. <br>
EMH: Well, I don't know what to say except thank you. I suppose I'd
have stayed in that deep freeze forever. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We're not here to salvage your programme. We're here to
prevent this disaster from ever happening. <br>
KIM: You see Doc, fifteen years ago, I miscalculated the Slipstream
threshold and transmitted the wrong phase corrections to Voyager. Boom!
They were knocked out of the Slipstream and sent to an icy death. Thank
you, Ensign Kim. But I've had a long time to rethink my mistake, and now
I know how to fix it. So, we're going to send Voyager a new set of
phase corrections. <br>
EMH: Isn't it a little late for that? <br>
CHAKOTAY: We've found a way to communicate with Voyager, in the past,
just before the accident. <br>
KIM: Better late than never. <br>
EMH: A message back through time? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Exactly. <br>
EMH: How? <br>(Kim opens a stasis unit to reveal a defrosted Seven.)<br>EMH: I don't understand. <br>
CHAKOTAY: One of her cranial implants is a transceiver designed to
communicate with other drones. <br>
EMH: That's right. It's called an interplexing beacon. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We want you to extract the beacon and determine its translink
frequency. <br>
EMH: That shouldn't be a problem. She looks reasonably well-preserved. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Good. That'll tell us where to send the message. Now the hard
part. We need to know when to send it. Can you access Seven's
chronometric node and pinpoint the exact moment her cybernetic implants
disengaged from her organic systems? <br>
EMH: Her time of death? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Down to the millisecond, if possible. <br>
EMH: I'll see what I can do. <br>
KIM: I told you he'd come in handy. <br>
EMH: You said you'd found a way to communicate with Seven in the past.
How? <br>
KIM: Behold. Salvage component three six six nine eight. A Borg temporal
transmitter. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Starfleet Intelligence found it in the wreckage of a Borg
cube in the Beta Quadrant. <br>
KIM: We stole it. <br>(Tessa enters.)<br>
TESSA: Trouble. Long range sensors are picking up a Federation vessel. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How much time do we have? <br>
TESSA: I entered a low orbit and remodulated our shields, but it won't
be long before they find us. Six hours if we're lucky. <br>
EMH: Let me get this straight. You're fugitives? <br>
KIM: The Galaxy's most wanted. We stole the Delta Flyer too, right out of a
Federation shipyard. We're wanted on two counts of high treason and
conspiracy to violate the Temporal Prime Directive. <br>
EMH: Wonderful. Out of the icebox and into the fire. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We don't have time for this. Get started. <br>
EMH: Aye, sir. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We still have to retrieve those sensor logs. Get ready. <br>(Tessa starts to put on a thermal suit.)<br>
TESSA: Hello, Doctor. <br>
EMH: Do I know you? <br>
TESSA: No, but I feel like we're old friends. Tessa Omond. <br>
EMH: Hello. <br>
TESSA: It's an honour to finally meet Voyager's infamous EMH. <br>
EMH: Infamous? <br>
KIM: I've told her a few horror stories. <br>
TESSA:&nbsp;Actually, they've always spoken very highly of you. <br>
EMH: Ah ha. And how did you get involved with Bonnie and Clyde here? <br>
TESSA: Oh, I've had an interest in Voyager for a long time. <br>
KIM: They're having sex. <br>
EMH: Pardon? <br>
KIM: Chakotay and Tess. They're a couple, joined at the hip. <br>
TESSA: The truth is, Doctor, I didn't want Chakotay or Harry to have to
face this alone. I thought I could help. <br>

state of the art. <br>

access. <br>
CHAKOTAY: My command codes should still carry some weight. <br>(He sits in his old chair, and pauses for a while.)<br>CHAKOTAY: Looks like

all here. Alive. <br>

CHAKOTAY: Can I see that tricorder? <br>(He puts it on the pop-up screen between the two chairs.)<br>CHAKOTAY:&nbsp; It's downloading. Give it a minute.
<br>
TESSA: I don't supposed we have time for a tour. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Afraid not. Besides, I left my quarters a mess. In just a few
hours, if all goes as planned, we'll have changed history. The past
fifteen years erased. We don't have to do this. <br>
TESSA: Now you tell me. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm serious. <br>
TESSA: So am I, and I have no intentions of backing out. Chakotay. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Look at me. Last minute jitters, cold feet, I don't know what
to call it. Ridiculous, isn't it? After all these years working toward
this moment, and when it finally comes, all I can think about is losing
you. <br>
TESSA: Your heart has always been here, on Voyager. That'll never
change. This is where you belong. And who knows, maybe we'll meet
someday. <br>

KIM: Got to go. <br>
EMH: What was that all about? <br>
KIM: Oh, nothing. Letter to a friend. How's it look? <br>
EMH: No damage to the infrastructure, but I'll need an isoprobe. <br>
KIM: Way ahead of you, Doc. <br>
EMH: So what was it like, your homecoming? <br>
KIM: Antimatter fireworks, long-winded dignitaries, a Vulcan children's
choir. Oh, we got medals pinned to our tunics. Chakotay gave a speech
commemorating the Voyager crew. Brought a tear to everyone's eye.
Admiral McIntyre even wanted me to marry his daughter. <br>
EMH: At least you weren't buried under twenty metres of ice. <br>
KIM: You don't know how many times I wished I was. <br>
EMH: I suppose it must have been difficult, with all your friends and
colleagues left behind. <br>
KIM: Survivor guilt. Yeah, I heard a lot about that from the
counsellors back at Headquarters. You must learn to accept the fact
that you lived. Embrace life, move forward. I signed on at the first
deep space vessel I could find. We tried to calculate where Voyager
might have fallen out of the slipstream. Four years of searching. We
were close, I could feel it! Then Starfleet Command said it was time to
end the search. Low probability of success. All those admirals who
shook my hand at the homecoming. I went to see every last one of them,
begged them to keep the search alive. Pretty soon even Admiral McIntyre
stopped returning my calls. So I resigned from Starfleet. <br>
EMH: For the record, Seven's translink frequency is one zero eight
point four four two three six zero zero zero. <br>
KIM: Could be our lucky number. I'm encoding it now. <br>
EMH: When did you embark on your life of crime? <br>
KIM: The second I heard about this little gem. <br>(The temporal transmitter.)<br>
EMH: Mister Kim, did you ever stop to think about what you're trying to
do here? Altering the timeline may make things worse. At least you and
Chakotay survived. Why tempt fate? <br>

ago. The crew trusted in me and I let them down. <br>

if I were in your position, but I've got my own crew to protect, not to
mention fifteen years of history. So, I'm asking you again. Stand down,

somebody is you. <br>
KIM: It can't be done, Doc. I told you. <br>

we have to accept that. But what about sending Voyager a warning? Is
there a way to get them to abort the Slipstream flight? <br>

Captain's log, supplemental. Our Slipstream flight may have been brief,

dismantle the Quantum Drive until the technology can be perfected.

believe it originated from the future. Ten, twenty years from now. We
can't be sure. <br>
KIM: Wait a second. If I sent a message from the future and changed the
past, then that future would no longer exist, right? So, how could I
have sent the message in the first place? Am I making any sense? <br>
JANEWAY: My advice in making sense of temporal paradoxes is simple.
Don't even try. To me, all that matters is that somewhere, somehow,
sometime, you come through for us. And if you won't take it from me,
take it from you. Seven found a log entry encoded in the telemetry.

me. Fifteen years ago, I made a mistake and one hundred and fifty

changed. You owe me one. <br>
