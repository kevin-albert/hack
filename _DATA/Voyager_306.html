crew witness a supernova in a nearby gaseous cloud.) <br>
JANEWAY: Oh! <br>
CHAKOTAY: Incredible. <br>
JANEWAY: Absolutely thrilling. <br>
NEELIX: All I can say is, wow! What about you, Mister Vulcan? Isn't
that just, wow! <br>
TUVOK: Your inarticulate expression of awe notwithstanding, Mister
Neelix, it was a fascinating spectacle. <br>
KIM: That's the edge of the shock wave. The pressure's over ninety
kilopascals, thirty percent more than we predicted. <br>
JANEWAY: Tom, back us off at full impulse. I want to stay ahead of the
brunt of that wave. <br>
PARIS: Yes, ma'am. <br>
JANEWAY: Congratulations, everyone. Only two other crews in the history
of Starfleet have witnessed a supernova explosion. <br>
KIM: But neither one was this close. Less than ten billion kilometres.
Definitely a record. <br>
JANEWAY: Who brought the champagne? <br>
NEELIX: Champagne? Captain, if I thought you wanted champagne. <br>
JANEWAY: Relax, Neelix. It's a figure of speech. <br>
KES: Thanks for inviting us to watch with you, Captain. It's really got
me interested in learning more about stellar phenomenon. <br>
EMH: Just remember, Kes, anyone can stargaze on the Bridge, even a
hologram with a mobile emitter, but the real action will always be in
sickbay. <br>
JANEWAY: How'd those shield modifications hold up, B'Elanna? <br>
TORRES: Less than a seven percent power drain. <br>
JANEWAY: Good job. Chakotay, what do you say we get started analysing
those carbon conversion readings? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, you've been on the Bridge for fourteen straight
hours. Don't you think you deserve a little rest? Harry and I will get
to work on the astrometric analysis, and we'll give you a full report
in the morning. <br>
JANEWAY: You win. I'll see you at oh seven hundred. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Janeway
enters her quarters, and sees a bed covered in red satin sheets with
heart-shaped pillows.) <br>
JANEWAY: Janeway to security. Intruder alert. <br>
Q: There's no need to call room service, Kathy. I've already ordered. <br>
(He is wearing a red silk dressing gown.) <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, Q. <br>
Q: You did say you wanted champagne? <br>
JANEWAY: Janeway to security. Intruder alert. <br>
Q: Oh, it's no use. I've taken the proverbial phone off the hook. After
all, we don't want any interruptions. <br>
JANEWAY: What are you doing here? <br>
Q: To us. <br>
JANEWAY: There is no us, Q. <br>
Q: The night is young, and the sheets are satin. <br>
JANEWAY: I want you out. But first, get rid of this bed. <br>
Q: I have no intention of getting between those Starfleet issue sheets.
They give me a terrible rash. <br>
JANEWAY: Since you won't be getting in the bed, I wouldn't worry about
it. <br>
Q: Oh, Kathy, don't be such a prude. Admit it. It has been a while. <br>
JANEWAY: And it's going to be a while longer. Now get out. <br>
Q: So tense. Why don't you slip into something more comfortable? <br>
(Flash, and she is in a silk nightdress.) <br>
JANEWAY: If you think this puerile attempt at seduction is going to
work, you're even more self-deluded than I thought. <br>
Q: Now I see. You think I'm interested in some tawdry one night stand.
That's because I haven't told you why I'm here yet. Out of all the
females of all the species in all the galaxies, I have chosen you to be
the mother of my child. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh! <br>
Q: I know that you're probably asking yourself, why would a brilliant,
handsome, dashingly omnipotent being like Q want to mate with a scrawny
little bipedal specimen like me? <br>
JANEWAY: Let me guess. No one else in the universe will have you. <br>
Q: Nonsense. I could have chosen a Klingon Targ, the Romulan empress, a
Cyrillian microbe. <br>
(Janeway puts on a dressing gown.) <br>
JANEWAY: Really? I beat out a single-celled organism? How flattering. <br>
Q: It's an overwhelming honour, isn't it? I can't get you out of my
mind. You're confident, passionate, beautiful. <br>
JANEWAY: And totally uninterested. <br>
Q: Kathy, you can't leave. My cosmic clock is ticking. Besides, you
have no idea what you're missing. Foreplay with a Q can last for
decades. <br>
JANEWAY: Sorry, but I'm busy for the next sixty or seventy years. <br>
Q: Oh, I see, this is one of those silly human rituals. You're playing
hard to get. <br>
JANEWAY: As far as you're concerned, Q, I'm impossible to get. <br>
Q: Goody! A challenge. This is going to be fun. <br>
(Q disappears, and so does the awful bed.) <br>
JANEWAY: Janeway to bridge. <br>

CHAKOTAY: I've got those carbon conversion readings from the supernova.
<br>
JANEWAY: Thank you. Is there something else? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Have you heard anything more from Q? <br>
JANEWAY: No. I wish I could believe he's gone for good. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I was wondering just what just what you meant when you said
he made a personal request. <br>
JANEWAY: He wants to mate with me. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I see. <br>
JANEWAY: Obviously, it's out of the question. And I suspect it's a
smoke screen. Knowing Q, he's probably got some hidden agenda. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe. <br>
JANEWAY: Chakotay. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I know I don't have any right to feel this way, but this
bothers the hell out of me. <br>
Q: I do believe you're jealous. (to Janeway) Why didn't you tell me
there was another man? <br>
(Q is in Starfleet uniform.) <br>
JANEWAY: Because there isn't. I'm just not interested in you. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Any more questions? <br>
Q: I was wondering, Kathy. What could anyone possibly see in this big
oaf, anyway? Is it the tattoo? Because mine's bigger. <br>
(And covers the left half of his face.) <br>
JANEWAY: Not big enough. &nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Captain's

he's up to something more than pursuing me, I've instructed the crew to
take every opportunity to uncover his true motives. </font></p>

PARIS: Who says crew performance reports have to be a chore? <br>
KIM: Sure beats working on the bridge. <br>
PARIS: Now if we could just convince the Captain to start holding
morning briefings in here. <br>
KIM: That'll be the day. <br>
(The ladies are removed to a newcomer.) <br>
Q: Nice programme, Tommy. But it's all just so much holo-pleasure,
isn't it? <br>
PARIS: All right, Q, we'll bite. What do you want? <br>
Q: Guys, I just don't understand your Captain. I've tried everything.
Filling the Bridge with roses, writing Drabian love sonnets, serenading
her in her bath. <br>
PARIS: Oh, I'll bet she loved that one. <br>
Q: But no matter what lengths I go to win her heart, she rejects me.
Me! How, I ask you, is that possible? <br>
KIM: Did it ever occur to you that she just doesn't like you? <br>
Q: No. <br>
PARIS: Look, Q, we've been told about your appearances on the
Enterprise. We know your little visits usually turn out to be more than
meet the eye. So save your broken heart routine, and tell us what
you're really after. <br>
Q: I just thought that the two of you might be able to give me some
advice on how to break through Kathy's icy exterior. You know, man to
man. <br>
PARIS: My advice would be to give up before you embarrass yourself
anymore than you already have. Come on, Harry. We're not going to get a
straight answer out of this guy. <br>
Q: You, bar rodent, another one of these fruity concoctions. <br>
NEELIX: Not unless you tell me why you're bothering Captain Janeway. <br>
Q: Captain Janeway? Now that's a subject I want to discuss. Tell me,
what are some of her favourite things. Chocolate truffles? Stuffed
animals? Erotic art? <br>
NEELIX: You can't bribe Captain Janeway. <br>
Q: Oh, no? Isn't that what you do? <br>
NEELIX: What are you talking about? <br>
Q: I understand that you acquire things for her, create little
interesting diversions, prepare little tasty treats. After all, why
else would she be so fond of your fur-lined face? <br>
NEELIX: Do you want to know what Captain Janeway likes about me? I'll
tell you. I am respectful, loyal and most of all, sincere. And those
are qualities which someone like you could never hope to possess. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Janeway
hears the whimpering of a small canine and goes to investigate. The
cocker spaniel puppy is in a basket under her desk.) <br>
JANEWAY: This isn't going to work, Q. <br>
Q: How can you ignore that face? <br>
JANEWAY: He's adorable. But this has to stop. <br>
Q: Please, accept him as a small token of my affection. <br>
JANEWAY: No. <br>
Q: Suit yourself. May we talk? Just talk. <br>
(Q sits on the bench below the windows, cradling the puppy. Janeway
reluctantly joins him.) <br>
Q: I'm afraid that I haven't been sincere. When you first asked why I
wanted to have a child with you, I made jokes, bragged about my
prowess, engaged in sexual innuendo. I was using all that to cover up
my true feelings. <br>
JANEWAY: And I suppose you want to share your true feelings with me
now. <br>
Q: I'm lonely. <br>
JANEWAY: Lonely? <br>
Q: Oh, I know it's hard to believe, but I've been single for billions
of years. It was fun at first, gallivanting around the galaxy, using my
omnipotence to impress females of every species. The fact of the matter
is, it left me empty. I want someone to love me for myself. I guess
what I'm saying is, I want a relationship. I just thought if you and I
had a child, it would give me that kind of stability and security that
I've been missing. <br>
JANEWAY: Sorry, Q. I'm not buying it. <br>
(He passes over the puppy.) <br>
Q: Oh. All right. Let's see if you buy this. You're stuck out here,
thousands of light years from home, and you aren't getting any younger,
are you? All your hopes for home, hearth and family grow dimmer every
day. Admit it, Kathryn, you're lonely too. And you wonder if you will
ever have a child. <br>
JANEWAY: You're right. I would like to have a child someday. But not
with you. <br>
Q: Why not? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm just not the right kind of woman for you, Q. <br>
FEMALE Q: Truer words were never spoken. <br>
(A tall, sarcastic redhead in Starfleet uniform.) <br>
Q: Q! How did you find me? <br>
FEMALE Q: Never mind that. What are you doing with that dog? I'm not
talking about the puppy. <br>
Q: Can't you see I'm busy here? Stop stalking me. <br>
FEMALE Q: You should be back in the Continuum. <br>
JANEWAY: Excuse me, but who are you exactly? <br>
Q: Kathryn Janeway, may I present Q. <br>
FEMALE Q: Not just any Q. His Q. <br>
Q: We were involved for a while. <br>
FEMALE Q: About four billion years. And now you desert me to pollute
the Continuum with the DNA of this narrow little being. <br>
Q: I never said it was exclusive. <br>
FEMALE Q: Stay away from him. <br>
JANEWAY: Look, Miss Q, I'll save you a lot of trouble. I have zero
interest in him. <br>
Q: Oh! Now you see what you've done? And I was finally making progress.
<br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Bridge to Janeway. You'd better come in here, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: On my way. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Report. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You're not going to believe this, Captain, but another star
in this cluster just went supernova. It's point oh two light years from
our current position. <br>
KIM: Make that two supernovas, Commander. I just picked up another one
at two one seven mark four seven. Estimated time of implosion, sixty
seven seconds. <br>
JANEWAY: Get us out of here, Tom. <br>
PARIS: I can't. A subspace shock wave from the star is collapsing the
warp field. <br>
JANEWAY: Red alert. Tuvok, increase power to the shields. Tom, lay in a
course away from that shock wave, maximum impulse. <br>
(Miss Q is leaning against the rail. Q is further along.) <br>
JANEWAY: A star going supernova is an event that occurs once every
century in this galaxy. Now we're about to witness our third in less
than three days, all in the same sector. Why do I suspect you have
something to do with this? <br>
FEMALE Q: She maybe a member of an intellectually challenged species,
but she's right. Your irresponsible behaviour is continuing to have
cosmic consequences. <br>
Q: Will you stop overreacting? Always nagging. Now you see why I left
her. <br>
JANEWAY: Are you causing these supernovas? <br>
Q: Well, not exactly. <br>
JANEWAY: What's that supposed to mean? <br>
PARIS: It's no use, Captain. the shock wave is too fast for us. <br>
JANEWAY: Try evasive manoeuvres. <br>
TUVOK: I'm afraid a course correction will be futile, Captain. There
are now three distinct shock waves heading toward us on various
trajectories. It will be impossible to avoid them all. <br>
JANEWAY: Divert auxiliary power to the shields. (to Q) You have the
ability to get us out of here, so do it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Sixteen seconds to impact. I'm not sure if the shields will
hold. <br>
JANEWAY: Do something, Q. <br>
Q: Well, if you insist. <br>
(Q snaps his fingers, and he and Janeway disappear.) <br>
FEMALE Q: That two-timing toad! <br>
(She vanishes as well.) <br>

Civil War Union Army officer.) <br>
Q: Well, I must admit, your gown is very becoming. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't have time for your little fantasies. Return me to
Voyager. <br>
Q: This is no fantasy. You're in the Q Continuum. <br>
JANEWAY: The Continuum? <br>
Q: That's right. I'm simply allowing you to perceive it in the context
your human mind can comprehend. <br>
JANEWAY: The last time you brought me here, it looked like some sort of
way station on a desert road. <br>
Q: It was awfully drab, wasn't it? But this, this is a much more
colourful representation for a human of American descent, don't you
think? An elegant manor house, a beautiful Southern belle, a dashing
Union officer determined to win her affections despite her hatred for
Yankee interlopers. <br>
JANEWAY: Enough. The only thing that interests me right now is the
welfare of my ship and crew. <br>
Q: Well, I'm sure your first officer, Chuckles, is it? I'm sure he's
got everything under control for the moment. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd like to make sure of that myself, if you don't mind. <br>
Q: This has gone way beyond your ship. It's even gone beyond you and
me. This is about the future of the Continuum itself. <br>
JANEWAY: Stop speaking in riddles, and tell me what's going on. <br>
Q: I'll do better than that. I'll show you. <br>
(He opens the shutters on the French windows. Fires burn in the
distance, and
there is the sound of cannonfire.) <br>
Q: The Continuum is burning. The Q are in the middle of a civil war. <br>
JANEWAY: Start explaining. <br>
Q: Do you remember our friend, Quinn? <br>
JANEWAY: The Q who committed suicide aboard Voyager? <br>
Q: Do you recall what I said might happen if he were allowed to take
his own life? <br>
JANEWAY: You said it would represent an interruption to the Continuum.
That it could have dire consequences. <br>
Q: I'd say a civil war is pretty dire, wouldn't you? <br>
JANEWAY: His death caused this conflict? <br>
Q: It caused chaos and upheaval. Because even though he was gone, his
calls for freedom and individualism continued to echo in the ears of
those who believed in his teachings, myself among them. I sounded the
trumpet and carried the banner. Naturally, others followed. The forces
of the status quo tried to crush us once and for all, but we fought
back. And now there's a cosmic struggle for supremacy, and the battle
is spreading, causing hazardous repercussions throughout the galaxy. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh! The supernovas. <br>
Q: You might call them galactic cross fire. It's terrible, isn't it?
But it's also a wonderful opportunity. <br>
JANEWAY: I fail to see anything wonderful about a war. <br>
Q: War can be an engine of change. War can transform a society for the
better. Your own Civil War brought about an end to slavery and
oppression. <br>
JANEWAY: But our Civil War came at a time before mankind had learned to
resolve disputes without bloodshed. Surely the Q have evolved to a
point where you can find a non-violent way to resolve a conflict. <br>
Q: That's where you come in. <br>
JANEWAY: What do I have to do with any of this, Q? <br>
Q: I want you to help me transform the Continuum in the same way your
Civil War transformed a nation. <br>
JANEWAY: By mating with you? <br>
Q: I know. It's brilliant, isn't it? <br>
JANEWAY: I don't see how a baby is going to end a war being fought by a
race of omnipotent beings. <br>
Q: It's simple. Mating will create a new breed of Q, which will combine
my omnipotence and infinite intellect with the best that humanity has
to offer. <br>
JANEWAY: You believe human DNA is going to restore peace? <br>
Q: Precisely. What the Continuum needs right now is an infusion of
fresh blood, a new sensibility, a new leader, a new messiah. Think of
it, Kathy. Our child will be like a precious stone tossed into the
cosmic lake, sending endless ripples of human conscience and compassion
to wash up on every distant shore of the universe. What greater
contribution could a being of your limited power ever hope to make?
What is more important to humanity than peace? I'm offering you the
opportunity to be the mother of peace. <br>

Q: Well? <br>
TORRES: Well what? <br>
FEMALE Q: Are you finished yet? <br>
TORRES: What you've asked us to do requires a complete reconfiguration
of the shield array. It takes a while. For us mere morals, that is. <br>
FEMALE Q: Surely there's some way you can speed up the process? <br>
TORRES: If you're in such a hurry, why don't you just snap your fingers
and do it yourself? Oh, that's right. You've lost your powers and you
need our help. <br>
FEMALE Q: I don't think you understand. It's imperative that I get back
to the Continuum before Q mates with your Captain. <br>
TORRES: I understand perfectly. You aren't the first female who's ever
had a man run out on her. <br>
FEMALE Q: I hope you're not comparing some failed romance in your
pitiful existence to my eternal association with Q. <br>
TORRES: You know, I have really had it with this superiority complex of
yours. <br>
FEMALE Q: It's not a complex, dear. It's a fact. <br>
TORRES: Well, here's another fact. If you don't stop pestering me, I'm
never going to finish. In which case, your association with Q might not
be quite as eternal as you think. <br>
FEMALE Q: you know, I've always liked Klingon females. You've got such
spunk. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Janeway
wipes Q's head with a damp cloth. He wakes.) <br>
Q: Where are we? <br>
JANEWAY: One of your faction's encampments. <br>
Q: How? <br>
JANEWAY: I pulled you out of the mansion and managed to hide you from
the enemy patrols. Then I spotted some of your people retreating from
the battle. From the look of them, I'd say you're not on the winning
side. <br>
Q: You saved my life. <br>
JANEWAY: And now it's time to end all this. <br>
Q: I knew you'd come around. <br>
JANEWAY: I've been thinking about what you said, that creating a new Q
could bring an era of peace. <br>
Q: Oh, my wild, sweet Kathy. I promise you won't regret it. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, you're not going to have a child with me. You're going to
mate with that charming lady friend of yours that appeared on my ship. <br>
Q: Mate with another Q? Ridiculous. <br>
JANEWAY: It sounded to me like you and she had a very long term
relationship. <br>
Q: Yes, but it was never physical. I mean, the Q are way beyond sex.
It's never been done. <br>
JANEWAY: Really? Then how exactly did the Q come into existence in the
first place? <br>
Q: The Q didn't come into existence. The Q have always existed.
Besides, I can only mate with a species capable of copulation, like
you. <br>
JANEWAY: But I don't love you, Q. <br>
Q: Yes, but what does that have to do with it? <br>
JANEWAY: Everything. It's the foundation of a family. I could never
have a child with someone I didn't love, much less give it up to the
Continuum. <br>
Q: Dearest Kathy, I would never dream of having you give it up. I mean,
who would raise it? Who would look after it? I'm really not cut out to
be a wet nurse. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, so you're not willing to do the hard work? <br>
Q: I'm an idea man. Hard work isn't my forte. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd change specialties if I were you, because the kind of
trouble you're in needs more than a quick fix. You can't just sprinkle
a little human DNA into the Continuum and make everything all right. <br>
Q: Why not? <br>
JANEWAY: Those best qualities of humanity you talked about aren't a
simple matter of genetics. Love, conscience, compassion. <br>
(She fits him with a sling.) <br>
Q: Ow. <br>
JANEWAY: They're attributes that mankind has developed over centuries.
Values that have passed from one generation to the next, taught by
parents to their children. Creating a new kind of Q is a noble idea,
but it will take more than impregnating someone and walking away. If
you want your offspring to embrace your ideals, you're going to have to
teach them yourself. <br>
Q: Yes, but that's exactly why I want you here, to nourish and guide
the little tyke. Think of the opportunities here in the Continuum. The
entire universe would be our child's playground. Together the two of
you could explore dimensions you've never even imagined. Fess up. Isn't
it even slightly tempting? <br>
JANEWAY: I'd be lying if I said no. What explorer wouldn't be intrigued
by the idea of seeking out whole new dimensions. But I have other
responsibilities, and I won't just abandon them. <br>
Q: Ah, yes. The crew of the intrepid starship Voyager. Perhaps you'd be
interested in sending them home. <br>
JANEWAY: You've tempted me with that prospect before. But frankly, your
credibility is more than a little suspect. My crew and I will get home.
We're committed to that. But we're going to do it through hard work and
determination. We are not looking for a quick fix. <br>
Q: Even if I wanted to mate, I wouldn't know how. It's totally
unprecedented. <br>
JANEWAY: You'll figure something out. You are omnipotent, after all. <br>
Q: I need time to think about it. <br>
JANEWAY: Time's up, Q. You've got to stop this war before it destroys
the Continuum. Now I'm taking this white flag, and I'm going over to
the enemy camp, and I'm going to tell them you're ready to talk about
terms for a ceasefire. <br>
Q: Kathy, don't be a hero. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm going, Q. So if I were you, I'd start working on a way to
set that precedent. &nbsp; </font></p>

CHAKOTAY: What is it, Harry? <br>
KIM: She's put us on a direct course for another star about to go
supernova. <br>
FEMALE Q: You did say you wanted to get into the Continuum? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes, but in one piece. <br>
FEMALE Q: Try to wrap your minuscule mind around this. These supernovas
are actually caused by spatial disruptions within the Continuum, the
result of the war. Now, each time a star implodes, a negative density
false vacuum is created which actually sucks the surrounding matter
into the Continuum. <br>
CHAKOTAY: So Voyager will be pulled in too. <br>
FEMALE Q: If we time it perfectly. Otherwise, the subsequent explosion
will blow you all into microfragments. <br>
TUVOK: Commander, I needn't remind you that close proximity to a
supernova will crush us, whether or not we time it perfectly. <br>

Q: Ah, Captain Janeway, I presume. (to guard) You're dismissed. I'm
sorry to have kept you waiting, madam, but, please sit down. I
understand you walked into our camp alone and unarmed? <br>
JANEWAY: That's right. <br>
COLONEL Q: The Continuum's a dangerous place for all of us right now,
not to mention a solitary human female. I admire your bravery. <br>
JANEWAY: I've come with an offer of truce from Q. <br>
COLONEL Q: I'm afraid the time for diplomacy has passed, madam. If we
don't end this war quickly, the damage to subspace will be
irreversible. <br>
JANEWAY: Then you agree the fighting has to stop. <br>
COLONEL Q: Most certainly. That's why we intend to bring this war to a
conclusion by the most expedient means possible. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm relieved to hear you say that. May I ask how? <br>
COLONEL Q: Quite simple, really. Since Q is the ringleader of this
so-called freedom faction, we shall have to execute him. <br>
JANEWAY: With all due respect, sir, there are no chapters in the
history of my own people more tragic than wars which set neighbour
against neighbour. Q has an idea for a non-violent way to bring this
conflict to an end. I urge you to listen to what he has to say. <br>
COLONEL Q: We are already resolved, madam. I'd be greatly in your debt
if you'd tell me where we can find him. <br>

for an eternity. Put them both in chains. <br>

PRIVATE: Captain. <br>
CAPTAIN: Private. <br>
(Q and Janeway are lead out.) <br>
JANEWAY: Why won't you listen to me? I told your Commander last night
we can resolve the situation peacefully. <br>
Q: If it's any consolation, there are those in the Continuum who will
remember us as martyrs. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd rather skip that particular honour. <br>
(They are tied to stakes.) <br>
Q: Still, you have to admit, there's something romantic about going to
our deaths together. <br>
COLONEL Q: Do you have any last words? <br>
JANEWAY: I won't plead for my own life. From your perspective I know it
seems insignificant. But what is not insignificant is the fact that the
Q, as an omnipotent race, have an opportunity to be a positive force to
set a higher standard for other beings in the galaxy. I implore you
all, don't go through with this. Don't allow yourselves to continue
using violence to resolve your differences. <br>
COLONEL Q: Q, do you have anything to add? <br>
Q: Today I sacrifice my existence for the principles of freedom and
individuality that I have fought for so long. But this woman is
innocent. What's more, she saved my life, and she tried to save us from
each other. Kill me if you must, but let her go. <br>
COLONEL Q: A very touching speech, Q. But as usual, your rhetoric fails
to compensate for your irresponsibility. <br>
