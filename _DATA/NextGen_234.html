Captain's log, stardate 46271.5. The Enterprise has entered orbit of
Deinonychus Seven, but our scheduled rendezvous with the supply ship
Biko has been delayed for another forty eight hours. In the meantime,
many members of the crew are taking advantage of the delay to pursue
their own projects, myself included.

PICARD: Computer, pause playback. Come. <br>
(Data and La Forge enter) <br>
PICARD: Yes, gentlemen? <br>
LAFORGE: Captain we'd like your permission to take the Engineering
computer offline for a couple of hours. We're working on a new
interface that would allow Data to act as an emergency backup in the
event of a ship-wide systems failure. <br>
DATA: In theory, my neural network should be able to sustain key
systems until primary control is restored. <br>
PICARD: It sounds like an intriguing experiment. I'll be interested to
see the results. Permission granted. <br>
LAFORGE: It's possible we may even be able to run secondary systems
through Data. Weapons control, sensor arrays. <br>
PICARD: Yes, I get the idea, Mister La Forge. Thank you. Please
proceed. <br>

PICARD: Breakfast? <br>
CRUSHER: The play. <br>
PICARD: Ah, yes. Well, it's a very intriguing drama, but I really don't
have the time it would take to learn a part. And anyway, I'm not much
of an actor. <br>
CRUSHER: That's no problem. <br>

CRUSHER: Well, you wouldn't be playing one of the leads. <br>

CRUSHER: It's a very small part. Only two lines. <br>
PICARD: Really. <br>

PICARD: No, please, Mister Worf, come in. <br>
WORF: I was hoping to take advantage of the Biko's delay by staging
shipwide security drills. I have planned a tentative schedule. <br>
PICARD: Oh yes, this is very impressive, Mister Worf. But we'll be
taking on new personnel at Starbase one eighteen in a few weeks. Surely
the drills can wait until then. <br>
WORF: In that case, I will use the time to perform maintenance checks
on the forward phaser array. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, is there some reason why you're trying to give
yourself more work? <br>
WORF: No, sir. I simply wish to use the extra time <br>

ELI: If you mean murder, then I guess I'm guilty. I've killed twenty
three men, Sheriff. One more ain't
going to make much of a difference. Of course, shooting someone as ugly
as you couldn't be considered a crime, could it? Was you just born that
way, or did your momma marry an armadillo? <br>

TROI: They're not concerned with honour, Worf. This is the Ancient
West. There's a gunfighter out there who has the speed and accuracy of
an android. And in two hours, he's going to try to kill you.

RIKER: Mister Data. <br>
DATA: Howdy, Commander. <br>
RIKER: Geordi, what have you found? <br>
DATA: Well, we figure part of my memory structure (normally) was
replaced with information from the computer's recreational data base. <br>
LAFORGE: Specifically, the files relating to the nineteenth century
American West. <br>
RIKER: That would explain the accent. <br>
DATA: You got it, partner. <br>
RIKER: This is a result of the experimental interface? <br>
LAFORGE: I'm afraid so. But we've initiated a progressive memory purge
to restore Data's programming to its original state. He should be back
to normal in a couple of hours. <br>
RIKER: And what about the computer's recreational data base? <br>
LAFORGE: We started a memory purge there as well. It'll take another
hour, maybe two. <br>
DATA: Commander. You just sit tight. We'll have this all fixed up in
time for supper. <br>
RIKER: Good.

WORF: I will be positioned here, at the eastern end of the street.
Frank Hollander says he will approach from this end. When he reaches
this point, he will be within range. <br>
TROI: Understood. What about Alexander? <br>
WORF: There's a rain barrel in front of the saloon. It should be enough
to stop the bullets. <br>
(knocking at the door) <br>
ANNIE: You would not believe what I went through to get old man Newsom
to give up his telegraph machine. <br>
(Worf looks the morse code transmitter over) <br>
WORF: Excellent. <br>
ANNIE: Lord knows why I keep risking my life for you, Sheriff. <br>
(Troi signals Worf to respond) <br>
WORF: Oh, yes. Thank you, Miss Annie. I am in your debt. <br>
(the clock chimes four) <br>
(now it is five fifteen) <br>
WORF: I have connected the communicator's energy cell to serve as the
power source. <br>
TROI: How long will the field last? <br>
WORF: No more than fifteen seconds. It is highly unstable. <br>
TROI: Let's hope it's enough.

shopkeeper closes up and pulls down his blinds. The sun is on their
right. Frank and Alexander appear at the other end of the street.
Alexander is sent forward. then Eli. The Mexican and the outlaw now
look like Data as well, and come out of their hiding places. Eli and
Alexander cross in the middle of the street, then - ) <br>
DATA-FRANK: Eli, get down! <br>
WORF: Alexander! <br>

forcefield and Frank fires, emptying his pistol for nothing. The
forcefield switches off) <br>

TROI: Don't even think about it. <br>
DATA-MEXICAN: Senor Frank! <br>

as Frank catches and starts to aim it, Worf shoots it out of his hand.
The Mexican goes into hiding again.) <br>
DATA-FRANK: Go ahead. Shoot me. <br>
WORF: Do not show your face in this town again. <br>
