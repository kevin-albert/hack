<br>
CRUSHER: You were like a brother to me. Do you remember? We used played
in the park near the lake. <br>
BARCLAY: Yes, of course. Every summer, you came to Bergerac. <br>
CRUSHER: You used to make swords out of the reeds, and when you cut
your hand you would come running to me, and I would say, Let me see.
Oh! How did you do that? <br>
BARCLAY: Playing near the Porte de Nesle. <br>
(he catches his hat on the scenery and it comes off) <br>
CRUSHER: And how many did you plat against? <br>
BARCLAY: No more than a hundred. <br>
CRUSHER: Tell me! <br>
BARCLAY: No. <br>
CRUSHER: (sotto, prompting) Let it go. <br>
BARCLAY: (sotto) What? <br>
CRUSHER: (sotto) Let it go. <br>
BARCLAY: Let it go. Let it go. You tell me what you were going to say.
Do you dare? <br>
CRUSHER: I do dare. I love someone. <br>
BARCLAY: Ah! <br>
CRUSHER: He does not know. <br>
BARCLAY: Ah! <br>
CRUSHER: Not yet. But he is proud, noble, brave and beautiful. <br>
BARCLAY: Beautiful? <br>
CRUSHER: What's the matter? <br>
BARCLAY: With me? Nothing. It is my hand. He is in the Guards? <br>
CRUSHER: Since this morning. Baron Christien de Neuvillette. In your
own regiment. <br>
BARCLAY: Ah. <br>
CRUSHER: Promise me. Promise me to be his friend. <br>
BARCLAY: I promise. <br>
CRUSHER: Oh, I love you. I must go now. Oh, and tell him to write me. A
hundred men! What courage! <br>
BARCLAY: Oh, but I have done better since. <br>
(polite applause) <br>
RIKER: Bravo! <br>
TROI: Wonderful! Wonderful. <br>
DATA: Lieutenant Barclay's performance was adequate, but clearly not
rooted in The Method approach. I do not understand why. <br>
RIKER: Data, because it's polite. <br>
LAFORGE: Good job, Reg. And only what, six weeks of lessons. <br>
CRUSHER: Good job, period. <br>

CRUSHER: Ah, Worf, I have an opening in my workshop. <br>
(Crusher, Riker, Work and La Forge leave) <br>
TROI: Well done. <br>
BARCLAY: Thank you, Counsellor. <br>
TROI: You've come a long way, Reg. <br>
BARCLAY: After more rehearsals than I can count. <br>
TROI: I don't just mean your acting ability. It takes a great deal of
courage to put yourself on display like that. <br>
BARCLAY: You think so? <br>
TROI: There was a time when nothing could have dragged you onto a stage
in front of an audience. You've made tremendous progress. <br>
BARCLAY: I, I guess. <br>
TROI: Don't you think so? <br>
BARCLAY: Well, I just feel more more comfortable playing somebody else.
Maybe all this is not any better than escaping into a holodeck fantasy.
<br>
TROI: I disagree. This isn't fantasy, it's theatre. You used to
withdraw onto the holodeck. You isolated yourself inside your own
imagination, avoiding contact with real people. Look at yourself now.
Look at all the other people you're with. You're not just acting,
you're interacting. Give yourself some credit, Mister Barclay. <br>
BARCLAY: Maybe you're right.

WORF: Captain, I am picking up an unidentified device one point eight
kilometres from the array. <br>
PICARD: On screen. Magnify. <br>

RIKER: That's some kind of probe. I'll bet that's what damaged the

right? <br>

Increase to three point zero. <br>
BARCLAY: Commander? <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, Reg? <br>
BARCLAY: Thanks for assigning me to this mission. <br>
LAFORGE: Don't mention it. You're one of my top engineers. It's about
time you got in on some of the interesting stuff. This, this is why I'm
in Starfleet. <br>
BARCLAY: There's still no modulation. <br>
LAFORGE: Hit it with a positron emission. <br>
(there's a big flare of light from the probe) <br>

PICARD: Very well. Isolate the probe and place it in tow. We'll take it
to Science Station four oh two in the Kohlan system. <br>

overload your optic nerves. It knocked you unconscious. <br>
LAFORGE: My visor must have filtered it out. <br>
CRUSHER: Exactly. But there was no apparent retinal damage and the
cornea looks fine. But I'm still waiting for a full
sero-amino readout. I'll call you when it comes in. (to a medtech) I'd
like this done as quickly as possible, Ensign. <br>
BARCLAY: You shouldn't have to wait too long for the results. <br>
CRUSHER: What do you mean? <br>
BARCLAY: Couldn't you use a global mode in your scanner? It would be a
lot faster. <br>
CRUSHER: That's not possible. We're talking about human cells here, not
isolinear circuits. I think you'd better stick to engineering,
Lieutenant. <br>
BARCLAY: A cell has a an electromagnetic signature just like a circuit
element does. Theoretically, it should work with just a few
adjustments. I could set it up for you, if you'd like. <br>

RIKER: Ensign, take us away from it. One quarter impulse. <br>

figure out exactly how you did it. <br>
BARCLAY: Well, it just occurred to me that I could set up a frequency
harmonic between the deflector and the shield grid using the warp field
generator as a power flow anti-attenuator, and that of course naturally
created an amplification of the inherent energy output. <br>

Your report, Mister La Forge. <br>
LAFORGE: Each of the telescope's subspace antenna clusters is powered
by its own fusion reactor, but a single computer controls them all. <br>
RIKER: So all eighteen reactors were affected when the computer was
damaged? <br>
LAFORGE: That's right. They're starting to overload, and could
eventually go critical. The explosion would destroy the Array, and I
wouldn't want to be next door when that happens. <br>
DATA: A standard isolation procedure would be advisable. <br>
LAFORGE: I agree. We'll cut off each reactor from the damaged control
system and repair them one by one. <br>
RIKER: How long will that take? <br>
LAFORGE: Two to three weeks at least. <br>
PICARD: All right, Mister La Forge. <br>
BARCLAY: I don't agree. We could repair all of the reactors
simultaneously instead of one by one. <br>
PICARD: Simultaneously? All eighteen? <br>
BARCLAY: Yes, sir. <br>
LAFORGE: But the Argus computer is inoperable. <br>
BARCLAY: Not entirely. The core memory is still intact, and we could
programme a completely new control system. <br>
DATA: An interesting suggestion, Lieutenant. However, that approach
would require much more time than our original plan. At least seven
weeks. <br>
BARCLAY: I could have it ready for you in two days. <br>
RIKER: What? <br>
BARCLAY: If you could assist me in the morning, Commander. <br>

BARCLAY: I had some ideas late last night. I needed to consult with the
computer about some quantum electrodynamic calculations. A holodeck
Einstein programme seemed like the best way. I guess I went a little
overboard. <br>
LAFORGE: A little? Most of the stuff on that blackboard was way out of
my league. And yours too. <br>

sure <br>
LAFORGE: Reg, ever since our run in with that probe, something's
different about you. <br>

theories with Albert Einstein! <br>

percent. Pre and postsynaptic membranes have increased permeability to
match it. I couldn't even guess at your IQ level now. <br>
BARCLAY: Probably somewhere between twelve hundred and fourteen fifty. <br>
CRUSHER: But that isn't all. The corpus callosum, the connecting bridge
between both sides of the brain, it is so
active now that the hemispheres are essentially behaving as one. <br>

LAFORGE: How can we do that? What's he done? We're talking about
locking a man up for being too smart. <br>
RIKER: If he's been influenced by an alien, wouldn't that put us all at
risk? <br>
CRUSHER: Not necessarily. It might be something as simple as an
allergic reaction to a bee sting. <br>

TROI: Well, he did make a pass at me last night. (Riker and La Forge

BARCLAY [OC]: I'm sorry, Captain, I was only trying to help. Our
computer was too slow to compensate for the overload on the Array. So I
created an interface that communicated my thoughts directly to the
central processing unit. <br>
RIKER: Exactly what does that mean? <br>
BARCLAY [OC]: My body is as you see it here, but much of my higher
brain functions and memory have been transferred to the starboard

PICARD: Mister Barclay, remove yourself from the computer system. Leave
the holodeck. <br>
BARCLAY [OC]: I'm afraid I can't, sir. <br>
PICARD: Why not? <br>
BARCLAY [OC]: My primary cerebral functions are now operating almost
entirely from within the computer. They have expanded to such a degree
that it would be impossible to return to the confines of my human
brain. Any attempt to do so would mean my death.

computer begins. He's actually rewriting the isolinear chips each time
he extends himself a little further. <br>
RIKER: How do we get him out of there? <br>
LAFORGE: We don't. Not without killing him. <br>
PICARD: This is an intolerable situation. I have no wish to harm him,
but I cannot allow Mister Barclay to continue to act
