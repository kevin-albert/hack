Stardate 48546.2. Our journey home is several weeks old now, and I have
begun to notice in my crew and in myself, a subtle change as the
reality of our situation settles in. Here in the Delta Quadrant, we are
virtually the entire family of man. We are more than a crew and I must
find a way to be more than a captain to these people, but it's not
clear to me exactly how to begin. </font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
(Janeway comes out of the turbolift and walks past a crewman gazing out
of an observation window in the corridor, then into Engineering.) <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: At the Academy, we are taught that a captain is expected
to maintain a certain distance. Until now, I've always been comfortable
with that distance.<br>
(Torres spots her from the upper catwalk.) <br>
TORRES: Captain, I didn't realise there was an inspection scheduled.<br>
JANEWAY: Not an inspection, Lieutenant. A stroll.<br>
TORRES: We should have the warp drive up and running by oh nine hundred
hours. Recalibrating the reactant injectors is the only thing we have
left to do.<br>
JANEWAY: Carry on. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Maybe this is just the way it works. Maybe the distance
is necessary. Maybe more than ever now, they need me to be larger than
life. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Mess
Hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> JANEWAY
[OC]: I only wish I felt larger than life. Computer, delete last
sentence.<br>
(Janeway enters. Paris and Kim are at a table, picking at their meal
trays.) <br>
JANEWAY: Gentlemen. As you were. So, has Neelix concocted anything
interesting this morning?<br>
KIM: There's an ancient Chinese curse, Captain. May you live in
interesting times. Mealtime is always interesting now that Neelix is in
the kitchen.<br>
JANEWAY: We shouldn't judge him too harshly. He is helping us conserve
replicator energy.<br>
PARIS: And I'm sure the gastrointestinal problems will go away as soon
as our systems get used to his, er, gourmet touch.<br>
JANEWAY: Well, I'll see you at duty call.<br>
(Janeway leaves.) <br>
KIM: We should've asked her to join us.<br>
PARIS: Ensigns don't invite captains to sit down.<br>
KIM: Why not?<br>
PARIS: Because they don't.<br>
KIM: Well, what's wrong with showing a little courtesy?<br>
PARIS: Captains don't want courtesy, they want respect. That's why they
don't get chummy with the lower ranks.<br>
KIM: Well, who else is she supposed to get chummy with out here? There
aren't many other captains and admirals for her to talk to.<br>
PARIS: If she wants to sit with us, she'll ask us to join her. That's
the way it's done.<br>
KIM: I think you're working from an old rule book, Paris.<br>
(Janeway tries to pour herself a cup of coffee at the counter, but the
jug is empty.) <br>
JANEWAY: Neelix? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Kitchen]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (He
doesn't appear to be around, so she enters and explores the various
bubbling pots and pans.) <br>
NEELIX: Captain! May I say, you look beautiful this morning. Is that a
new colour lipstick?<br>
JANEWAY: No. No, it's the same colour I always wear.<br>
NEELIX: Well, perhaps it's just the way the glow of the food heater
lamps hit you but you look wonderful. Not to suggest you don't always
look wonderful.<br>
JANEWAY: Neelix. Do we have any coffee left?<br>
NEELIX: No, but we have something even better.<br>
JANEWAY: I don't want something even better. I want coffee.<br>
NEELIX: It's made from a proteinaceous seed I discovered on an
expedition <br>
JANEWAY: Never mind. I'll use one of my replicator rations for coffee.<br>
NEELIX: That would not be appropriate, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: I beg your pardon?<br>
NEELIX: You need to set an example for the crew.<br>
JANEWAY: Well, thank you for reminding me.<br>
NEELIX: You're welcome. After all, if you want the crew to begin to
accept natural food alternatives instead of futher depleting our energy
reserves, you need to encourage them by your own choices, don't you?<br>
JANEWAY: Fine. Give me your even better than coffee substitute.<br>
NEELIX: And how about some Takar loggerhead eggs with that this morning?<br>
JANEWAY: Just coffee.<br>
NEELIX: It's a tiny bit richer blend than you're used to, but you'll
learn to love it.<br>
(Neelix pours the thick gloop into her cup.) <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Bridge to Janeway.<br>
JANEWAY: On my way. Janeway out. Tomorrow maybe. <br>
(Janeway leaves her cup, so Neelix drinks it.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Yes, Commander?<br>
CHAKOTAY: There was no need for you to come to the bridge, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Yes, there was.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I just wanted to alert you to a nebula we've picked up on
long range sensors.<br>
JANEWAY: Put it on screen. Magnify.<br>
TUVOK: There are unusually high levels of omicron particles within this
nebula, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Are you thinking we could collect these omicron particles to
provide an additional antimatter reserve, Lieutenant?<br>
TUVOK: Precisely.<br>
JANEWAY: Senior bridge officers, report for duty. Commander, set a new
course. There's coffee in that nebula. <br>
(Paris and Kim enter.) <br>
JANEWAY: Exploring this nebula should raise some spirits around here,
don't you think, Commander?<br>
CHAKOTAY: No way to go but up.<br>
JANEWAY: You're closer to the crew than I am. How bad is it?<br>
CHAKOTAY: There's a nuanka, a period of mourning, that everyone's going
through. It's a natural reaction.<br>
JANEWAY: I'm worried about them. I wish we had a counsellor on board,
but the nature of our mission didn't require one.<br>
CHAKOTAY: We talk to animals. It's a Native American tradition.<br>
JANEWAY: Animals?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Our own counsellors. We're taught that an animal guide
accompanies us through life. Basically, it's what Carl Jung thought he
invented when he came up with his active imagination technique in 1932,
but we've been doing pretty much the same thing for centuries.<br>
JANEWAY: Is there a different animal guide for everyone?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Actually, yes.<br>
JANEWAY: Let me guess. Yours is a bear.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Why do you say that?<br>
JANEWAY: You strike me as the bear type.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Thank you. The bear is a very powerful animal. It has great
pokattah. But he's not my animal guide. The creature that guides us
doesn't define who we are. It merely chooses to be with us.<br>
JANEWAY: Okay. If not a bear, then what?<br>
CHAKOTAY: I can't tell you that. It would offend my animal guide if I
spoke its name.<br>
JANEWAY: But he guides you well?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Actually, it's a female. But yes, she usually guides me very
well.<br>
JANEWAY: Can one just choose their own animal guide?<br>
CHAKOTAY: It's not quite that simple.<br>
PARIS: Captain. We're approaching the perimeter of the nebula.<br>
JANEWAY: Slow to one third impulse.<br>
CHAKOTAY: If you're interested, I'll be glad to teach you how to
contact your animal guide.<br>
JANEWAY: You've got a date. Analysis, Mister Kim.<br>
KIM: Seven AU's in diameter. Sensors are picking up intermittent gamma
and thermal emissions. Nothing our shields can't handle.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Paris, any problems for navigation?<br>
PARIS: I'm showing mostly hydrogen, helium and hydroxyl radicals. Some
local dust nodules. I don't see them giving us any trouble.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok, can you find us a rich deposit of omicron
particles in there?<br>
TUVOK: A significant concentration appears to exist approximately sixty
four million kilometres inside the perimeter.<br>
JANEWAY: Set coordinates.<br>
TUVOK: Aye, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Engines at one quarter impulse. Engage.<br>
(Voyager heads into the pinky purple swirly thing.) <br>
KIM: I've never seen anything like it.<br>
(Tuvok uses his comm. badge.) <br>
TUVOK: Tuvok to Kim. Mister Kim, that is a comment we'd prefer not to
hear from a senior officer on the Bridge. It makes the junior officers
nervous.<br>
KIM: Yes, sir.<br>
PARIS: Density has increased to forty two percent.<br>
JANEWAY: Cause?<br>
PARIS: Not sure. We seem to be drawing some interstellar dust toward us.<br>
JANEWAY: Engineering, could the magnetic field from our impulse engines
be attracting this dust? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
It's a good possibility, Captain. I'm showing the dust with a return
force ratio of four to one. Recommend we shut down impulse and go to
thrusters.<br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Acknowledged. Engage thrusters. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Ahead, slow.<br>
PARIS: Density still increasing. Up by seventy percent now.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok?<br>
TUVOK: The level of resistance poses no danger to the hull at this
time, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: How far to your omicron particle deposits?<br>
TUVOK: Twelve thousand four hundred kilometres.<br>
JANEWAY: Maintain course and <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
We seem to have encountered an energy barrier.<br>
JANEWAY: Is it natural or artificial? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
We're not reading any directed energy source down here, Captain. My
guess is it's a natural phenomenon. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: How far are we from the particles, Lieutenant?<br>
TUVOK: Just over seven thousand kilometres.<br>
JANEWAY: It's conceivable this energy barrier is related to those
particles. Mister Kim, if you can get a transporter beam through the
barrier<br>
KIM: Can't do it, Captain. The thoron emissions of the barrier would
interfere with the transporter signal.<br>
JANEWAY: Miss Torres, do we have enough power to take the ship through
the barrier? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
The barrier appears to be only fifty metres deep. A four second burst
at maximum thrusters ought to do it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: All right. Maximum shields. Engage full thrusters for four
seconds and then drop to one quarter.<br>
PARIS: Acknowledged. Engaging thrusters.<br>
(They push through the barrier.) <br>
JANEWAY: What do you make of it, Mister Tuvok?<br>
TUVOK: I am unable to offer identification, Captain.<br>
(Kim uses his comm. badge.) <br>
KIM: Kim to Tuvok. In other words, you've never seen anything like it.
Oh, I promise not to tell the junior officers.<br>
PARIS: Captain, the breach we just make when we penetrated the field?
It just closed behind us. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Mess
Hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> NEELIX:
Kes! Now look what she's gotten us into!<br>
KES: Do all nebulas look like that?<br>
NEELIX: I wouldn't know. I'm smart enough to go around nebulas when I
encounter them.<br>
KES: These people are natural born explorers, Neelix.<br>
NEELIX: These people are natural born idiots, if you ask me. They don't
appreciate what they have here. This ship is the match of any vessel
within a hundred light years, and what do they do with it? Well, let's
see if we can't find some space anomaly today that might rip it apart! <br>
KES: I don't think the Captain is an idiot. She cares a great deal
about her crew.<br>
NEELIX: You don't care a great deal about your crew and introduce them
to the spectre of death at every opportunity. And I speak as a member
of that crew now. I'm not sure I would've wanted you to come along had
I known that this is what <br>
KES: I think it's wonderful.<br>
NEELIX: Wonderful?<br>
KES: If I were Captain, I'd open every crack in the universe and peek
inside, just like Captain Janeway does.<br>
NEELIX: I don't deny the romantic quality of this sort of casting
about. I wouldn't exactly call it wonderful. <br>
(Kes kisses him, long and slow.) <br>
NEELIX: Although, it's getting more wonderful by the minute.<br>
KES: I've never kissed anyone inside a nebula before.<br>
(Thump! Thump!) <br>
NEELIX: What did I tell you? </font></p>

JANEWAY: Red alert.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Whatever they are, they're passing right through our shields.<br>
JANEWAY: Try reversing the shield polarity. Mister Tuvok?<br>
TUVOK: They appear to be made up of a non-reactive material that our
sensors do not recognise, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Clarify. Are we under attack?<br>
TUVOK: Uncertain. There is no indication of directed fire.<br>

JANEWAY: A drain? Why would we be losing energy?<br>
TORRES [OC]: I'm not sure, Captain. They seem to be drawing it right
through the shield grid along the hull.<br>
KIM: We've lost five percent of our energy reserves. Recommend we shut
down all non-essential systems.<br>
JANEWAY: Do it.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Reversing shield polarity hasn't had any effect.<br>
KIM: Energy reserves are down eight percent.<br>
JANEWAY: This is not what I had in mind. Mister Paris, take us back
through the energy barrier and out of here.<br>
PARIS: Reversing course.<br>
JANEWAY: Full thrusters.<br>
KIM: Thrusters firing.<br>
(Thump!) <br>
PARIS: We're not penetrating the energy barrier this time.<br>
TUVOK: Sensors show a build-up of magnesite dust along the outer rim of
the barrier.<br>

TUVOK: Fifteen thousand kilometres. We've cleared the central mass.<br>
JANEWAY: Stand down red alert. Take us to two thousand kilometres off
the perimeter and hold position. Get a sample of that matter off the
hull for Lieutenant Torres to analyse. I'd like to know what it was
that humbled every defence system on this ship. How much of our energy

(Chakotay goes up the step to the informal area by the window, puts his
bundle on the low table and sits on the floor. It takes a moment for
Janeway to take the hint and join him.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: A blackbird's wing. A stone from the river. An akoonah.<br>
JANEWAY: Akoonah?<br>
CHAKOTAY: My ancestors used psychoactive herbs to assist their vision
quests. Now they're no longer necessary. Our scientists have found more
modern ways to facilitate the search for animal guides. Place your hand
on it and concentrate on the stone. A-koo-chee-moy-a. We are far from
the sacred places of our grandfathers. We are far from the bones of our
people. But perhaps there is one powerful being who will embrace this
woman and give her the answers she seeks. Allow your eyes to close.
Breath to fuel the light in your belly, and let it expand until the
light is everywhere. Prepare yourself to leave this room and this ship,
and return to a place where you were the most content and peaceful you

offend your animal guide. As you continue to look around, you will
become aware of other life that shares this place with you. It will be
the first animal you see. That is the one you will speak to. Do you see

JANEWAY: The Commander was introducing me to my animal guide.<br>
TORRES: I hope that you have better luck with yours than I had with
mine.<br>
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna's the only one I know who tried to kill her animal
guide.<br>
TORRES: I'm sorry to interrupt, but the Doctor and I have come up with
a rather surprising analysis of the matter left on the hull. It's
organic.<br>
JANEWAY: Microscopic life forms from the nebula. <br>
TORRES: That's not what I mean. The samples are clearly organic
elements of a much larger life form. It appears, Captain, that this
nebula is not a nebula at all. </font></p>

and Janeway work at a science station.) <br>
EMH [on viewscreen]: I'm curious, Captain. Exactly what are you looking
for?<br>
JANEWAY: I need to know if we did serious harm to this life form.<br>
EMH [on viewscreen]: Let's see. You ran your ship through it, fired
phasers at it and blew a hole in it with a photon torpedo. I'd say it's
a pretty good chance that you did some fairly significant<br>
JANEWAY: Computer, mute audio. Isolate that concentration of omicron
particles we were tying to get to.<br>
TORRES: That would be right here.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok?<br>
TUVOK: I'm afraid the concentration of particles is far lower than I
originally observed. Furthermore, it appears that many of the particles
have now moved outside the energy barrier.<br>
JANEWAY: Is it possible they're leaking out through the breach we made?<br>
TUVOK: That would be a logical conclusion.<br>
JANEWAY: It's also a logical conclusion that all of the phenomena we've
encountered were actually this life form's natural defence systems.<br>
CHAKOTAY: The way the barrier was protecting the omicron particles
almost suggests we were entering a vital organ.<br>
JANEWAY: So it seems very clear that we've severely hurt an innocent
life form. How do we repair the harm we've done?<br>
PARIS: Er, Captain?<br>
(The EMH is waving his arms.) <br>
JANEWAY: Computer, resume audio.<br>
EMH [on viewscreen]: How kind of you. You may be interested to know
that the analysis of the organic sample suggested this life form has
the capacity to regenerate. The process may simply need a helping hand.<br>
JANEWAY: Any ideas how we could stimulate regeneration?<br>
EMH [on viewscreen]: Lieutenant Torres has the answer.<br>
TORRES: I do?<br>
EMH [on viewscreen]: You were the one who first observed that this life
form has a nucleogenic structure.<br>
TORRES: If the life form has a nucleogenic structure, nucleonic
radiation ought to assist its healing process. A nucleonic beam along
the edges of the breach should theoretically promote regeneration.<br>
EMH [on viewscreen]: Bravo.<br>
JANEWAY: Commander, take us to yellow alert and advise the crew that
we're going to re-enter the life form. Mister Kim, review all systems
in light of our first experience and see if you can provide new
safeguards. Tuvok, your job is to find some modification of the shields
that will hold off this life form's natural defence systems. We begin
at thirteen hundred hours. Dismissed. </font></p>

from its defence systems. Suggestions?<br>
CHAKOTAY: It seems to be leaving us alone now that we've cut off all

we might be able to get back without engaging any engines.<br>

CHAKOTAY: We've been reading these swirling energy currents since we
first got here. When we thought it was a nebula, we weren't looking for
any pattern. We thought they were just random eddies. But now I'm
wondering if these currents might be some kind of circulatory system.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Kim, are you showing omicron particles in these
currents?<br>
KIM: Affirmative, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: If the currents are distributing omicron energy throughout the
life form, the circulatory system might pass right by that wound.<br>
PARIS: We could get in one of those currents and surf back.<br>

Paris.<br>
PARIS: Aye, Captain. We're on our way. Speed, all of two hundred KPH.<br>

NEELIX: As the morale officer on this ship, I insist that a break in
the workload is both healthy and necessary. Go on, Mister Vulcan. It
might even help you loosen up. Or not.<br>
TUVOK: May I ask when you became morale officer?<br>
NEELIX: Oh, just a few minutes ago when I sensed crew morale might be
especially low. Mine certainly was. We were in a free fall at the time.<br>
KES: Cooking always helps Neelix to unwind.<br>
NEELIX: Yes, and after we stabilised, I certainly needed to unwind. So,
it seemed to me, I had a choice to either come up here and say I told
you so.<br>
PARIS: No.<br>
NEELIX: Or to try to do something constructive to help out in my own
humble manner. Try the stuffed Cardaway leaves. They're irresistible. <br>

us all to sing a few songs together.<br>

it to heal naturally.<br>

EMH [on monitor]: Your ship's energy systems are compatible with this
life form's omicron particles, are they not?<br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH [on

life form's needs in much the same manner as a suture. By allowing the
ship to serve as an energy conduit across the wound, the life form
should be able to regenerate itself more rapidly.<br>
PARIS: And how are we supposed to get the ship into the wound without
getting the hell beat out of us again?<br>
EMH: That's your problem, not mine. Doctor out.<br>
PARIS: That's sort of like asking a hurt dog not to bite you while you
tend to its wounds.<br>
JANEWAY: You like dogs, Mister Paris?<br>

would it be enough for you to manoeuvre into the breach in ten seconds?<br>

maybe even less than that.<br>
