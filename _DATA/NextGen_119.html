seeming discrepancies in the Captain's log. Let's go over them one by
one, shall we? <br>
RIKER: The Captain's log? <br>
REMMICK: Yes. To the best of your knowledge, has the Captain ever
falsified a log? <br>
RIKER: Have you discussed this with him? <br>
REMMICK: Right now, I'm asking you. <br>
RIKER: If you want to discuss anything about Captain Picard, you bring
him in here and ask him face to face. <br>
REMMICK: You are required to answer my questions, Mister Riker, unless
you're trying to cover something up! Now, there are several

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">REMMICK: So, you are saying Captain Picard had no
control over this vessel. He handed it over to Kosinski, who took the
entire crew to the edge of the universe. <br>
LAFORGE: No, sir. That's not what I'm saying. Now, Kosinski was sent by
Starfleet to improve our warp drive system. Captain Picard was ordered
to take him aboard. <br>
REMMICK: According to his own logs, his Bridge crew didn't think highly
of Mister Kosinski's theories, yet the Captain allowed him to access to
the engines anyway. Is that true, La Forge? <br>
LAFORGE: Not exactly, sir. <br>
REMMICK: One way or the other, La Forge, Picard lost control of this
ship. Is that true? <br>
LAFORGE: Yes, but that's not how it happened. <br>

in his history or his personality that would suggest mental lapses? <br>
TROI: Nothing. <br>
REMMICK: Not even the Ferengi incident with his old ship, the
Stargazer? <br>
TROI: He was being controlled by a mind altering machine, Commander.

WESLEY: Wait. I thought I wanted to be alone, but I guess I don't. <br>
WORF: How is the testing? <br>
WESLEY: Okay. So far. It's not the ones that I've studied for that I'm
worried about. It's the psych test. Facing my deepest fear and living
through it. I'm trying to figure out what images to bring up. <br>
WORF: Why? <br>
WESLEY: I guess I want to scare myself. What do you think? Bulgallian
rats? Lightning storms? <br>
WORF: Do those things frighten you? <br>
WESLEY: Sort of, I guess. <br>
WORF: The psych test is no more or less important than the rest of the
process. <br>
WESLEY: That's what they said, but I can't stop thinking about it. <br>
WORF: Thinking about what you can't control only wastes your energy and
creates its own enemy. <br>
WESLEY: How can they know what my deepest fear is when I don't? <br>
WORF: By analysing your psychological profile. They were very accurate
about everyone I tested with. Including myself. <br>
WESLEY: You? I thought there was nothing that could frighten a Klingon
warrior. <br>
WORF: Only fools have no fear. <br>
WESLEY: I'm sorry, Lieutenant. I'm asking too many personal questions. <br>
WORF: It is very difficult for me to depend on anyone for anything. But
especially for my life. <br>
WESLEY: But on the Enterprise you do that every day. Everyone depends
on everyone else to protect them. <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>

CRUSHER: We're Starfleet officers who've known each other for many
years. <br>
REMMICK: Everything said here is confidential, Doctor. You can be
completely open with me. <br>
CRUSHER: About what? <br>
REMMICK: About how you feel serving with a man who is responsible for
the death of your husband. <br>
CRUSHER: My personal feelings about Captain Picard are irrelevant to
this investigation, and none of your business. <br>
REMMICK: Then you confirm the accuracy of the log report. You violated
the Prime Directive with the Edo. You deliberately interfered with
their laws. <br>
PICARD: Yes. It's exactly as I explained it in the log records. <br>
REMMICK: All to save Doctor Crusher's son? <br>
PICARD: A member of my crew was being held unjustly. I stand by my
decision. Mister Remmick, you have talked to every member of this ship.
I think you've had enough time to find out whatever it is you're
looking for. <br>
REMMICK: Are you afraid if I keep looking that I'll find you're guilty?
<br>
PICARD: The only thing I'm guilty of is allowing this charade to go on
so long.

ask me directly what it is you want to know. And please tell me exactly
what is going on. <br>
QUINN: I need a little more time, Jean-Luc. <br>
PICARD: How much time? I won't tolerate my crew being harassed any
longer. <br>
QUINN: Remmick's full report is almost ready. <br>
PICARD: I want to be here when he presents it. <br>
QUINN: That has always been my intention. Commander Remmick, report to
Admiral Quinn. <br>
REMMICK [OC]: On my way, sir. <br>

itself. <br>
MORDOCK: No, it's going too fast. Wesley, I can't do it. <br>

CHANG: Congratulations, Mordock. That was the second fastest time ever
recorded on this test. You all did well. <br>
MORDOCK: No, it should not have been that way. Mister Crusher helped
me. <br>
CHANG: Yes. I know. An interesting choice, Mister Crusher. Especially
considering how close you and Mister Mordock are in overall score. You
all have an hour to prepare for your last test. <br>
WESLEY: The psych test, sir? <br>
CHANG: We prefer to think of it as a psychological evaluation based on
reactions to various individual problems, but psych test will do.

QUINN: Please sit down, Mister Remmick. Proceed with your report. <br>
REMMICK: Admiral, I've done my best to be thorough during this
investigation. <br>
QUINN: Continue. <br>
REMMICK: I couldn't find what you asked, sir. I spoke to officer after
officer, at length. I pried into the ships log reports. And yet I could
find nothing wrong. Except, perhaps, a casual familiarity among the
Bridge crew, but mostly that comes from a sense of teamwork, and the
feeling of family. I'm sorry, sir. I did my best. <br>
QUINN: Quite. You're dismissed, Commander. <br>
REMMICK: Yes, sir. Captain Picard, my tour in the Inspector General's
office will be up in six months. When I'm finished, this is where I'd
like to serve, sir. <br>
(No reply, and Remmick leaves) <br>
QUINN: Don't judge the young man too harshly. He's a good officer. <br>
PICARD: It's not him I'm inclined to judge. <br>
QUINN: Don't judge me too harshly either, until I've finished. We had
to be very sure of you. Some of us at Starfleet Command became
suspicious of certain problems in the Federation. <br>
PICARD: What kind of problems? <br>
QUINN: Something or someone is trying to destroy the fabric of
everything we've built up in the last two hundred years. <br>
PICARD: What's your evidence? <br>
QUINN: I can't go into that. There are too many people involved. <br>
PICARD: What do you want from me? <br>
QUINN: I don't know whether the threat comes from the inside or whether
it's from outside. I need people I can trust in strong positions
throughout the Federation. <br>
PICARD: You have my complete support. You know that. <br>
QUINN: That's not enough. I want to promote you to Admiral, and I want
you to take over as Commandant of Starfleet Academy. <br>
PICARD: The Academy. <br>
QUINN: Yes. <br>
PICARD: The Academy? <br>
QUINN: I need you close. <br>
PICARD: Then there was never a problem with the Enterprise. <br>
QUINN: No, but I had to be sure you hadn't been co-opted. <br>
PICARD: Greg, this is politics, and I'm not good at politics. Surely
there are others who are better suited. <br>
QUINN: All right. Even if I am wrong, and I hope I am, you're still the
best man for the job. <br>
PICARD: I appreciate the value of what you're offering. It's not a
decision I can make quickly. <br>
QUINN: I need an answer soon. <br>
PICARD: All right. You'll have it tonight, Admiral. Thank you.

unfair that only one candidate from Relva will attend the Academy this
year, and a loss to the Federation if the rest of you do not return to
test again. Mister Mordock will be the candidate. His results were
slightly higher than Mister Crusher's. Congratulations, Mister Mordock.
You're the first Benzite in Starfleet. <br>

lost points because he helped me. He should not be punished for his
