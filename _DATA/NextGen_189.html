RIKER: What happened? <br>
BEREL: You're in the crisis room at the Sikla Medical Facility. You've
had a severe injury, but you're going to be all right. <br>
RIKER: I was caught in the riots when the police moved in. It's the
last thing I remember. <br>
BEREL: Can you tell us your name? <br>
RIKER: Rivas. Rivas Jakara. <br>
BEREL: Rivas Jakara? Where do you live? <br>
RIKER: In the Marta community on the southern continent. <br>
TAVA: You're a long way from home. Do you have any members of your
family we should notify? <br>
RIKER: No, I have no family. I can't stay here. I have to get back. <br>
BEREL: You're in no condition to leave yet. There are several unusual
things about your case, Mister Jakara. Your cranial lobes, for
instance, they seem to be surgical implants. <br>
RIKER: I had cosmetic surgery to correct a genetic birth defect. <br>
BEREL: And these? (his hands) Another birth defect? <br>
RIKER: Yes, isn't that something? My father's were the same way. <br>
NILREM: You want us to believe that all your abnormalities are
inherited genetic traits? <br>
RIKER: I understand your confusion. My personal physician is much more
familiar with these genetic irregularities. To be honest, I would much
feel better back home under her care. <br>
BEREL: Why don't I talk to her about that. What's her name? <br>
RIKER: Crusher. Actually, I'm not sure you'll be able to reach her. <br>
BEREL: Why not? <br>
RIKER: She's taking a sabbatical. <br>
BEREL: Well, we'll do the best we can for you. Oh, there was one other
thing. We found this curious-looking device in your clothes. What is
it? <br>
(it's a phaser) <br>
RIKER: It's just a toy. I was taking home as a present. <br>
BEREL: I thought you didn't have any family. <br>
RIKER: It's for a neighbour's child. Was there anything else found? I
had one piece of jewelry, a metal pin. <br>

outer space. <br>

TAVA: What are you going to do? <br>
BEREL: Of all the medical facilities available, why did he have to end

NILREM: I think we ought to call Central Security. <br>
BEREL: Well, I'm not calling anybody yet. Not till we've done a lot
more. A lot more. I want his story checked out. Run a complete search
through the medical library. Be absolutely certain there's never been

from being a Romulan) <br>
MIRASTA: At twelve point four after launch, the warp field generator
will be activated. <br>
DURKEN: That's when it would break the light barrier? <br>
MIRASTA: Yes, Chancellor. If we're successful, the craft will leave our
star system, and in a matter of minutes will be on its way to the Garth
system. <br>
KROLA: And then what? <br>
MIRASTA: And then, Krola, we'll see what's there. <br>
DURKEN: How long, Mirasta? <br>
MIRASTA: We have the prototype design for the warp engine. It would
simply be a matter of building the actual production units. If I get
your approval today, ten months, maybe less. <br>
KROLA: Chancellor, I'll admit Mirasta's enthusiasm for her work is
seductive, but perhaps we're moving too fast. Your opponents will see
this as another example of your determination to pull us further from
our traditional ways. <br>
DURKEN: My opponents look back as I look forward. I cannot believe that
my people would choose to retreat after all we've done. <br>
MIRASTA: I agree. <br>
KROLA: The people were willing to accept your social reforms because
they believe in you, Chancellor. But there are many who say we have
gone far enough. All these new ideas, new technology, and now space
travel? It confuses them, frightens them. <br>
DURKEN: I will not allow them to remain in the dark ages. The warp
programme will proceed as you have outlined, Mirasta. And then we will
slow down, Krola, to let everyone catch their breath. Including you.

in) <br>
PICARD: Mirasta Yale? <br>
MIRASTA: Yes. <br>
TROI: Please, don't be alarmed at our appearance. <br>
PICARD: My name is Jean-Luc Picard. This is my associate Deanna Troi. <br>
MIRASTA: What are you? <br>
TROI: We've come with some important information. <br>
MIRASTA: About what? <br>
PICARD: About space. About the universe you are preparing to enter. <br>
TROI: We come from a federation of planets. Captain Picard is from a
planet called Earth, which is over two thousand light years from here.
I'm from another planet called Betazed. <br>
PICARD: We've been monitoring your progress toward warp-drive
capability. When a society reaches your level of technology and is
clearly about to initiate warp travel, we feel the time is right for
first contact. We prefer meeting like this, rather than a random
confrontation in deep space. <br>
TROI: We've come to you first because you're a leader in the scientific
community. Scientists generally accept our arrival more easily than
others. <br>
PICARD: We almost always encounter shock and fear on this sort of
mission. We hope that you will help us facilitate our introduction. <br>
MIRASTA: Is this a joke? Did Lupo and the others from the lab put you
up to this? <br>
PICARD: It's certainly no joke. As you can see, we are physically quite
different from Malcorians. And, with your permission, I'm prepared to
prove it to you. <br>
MIRASTA: I would like that. <br>
PICARD: Picard to Enterprise. Three to beam up.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Mirasta is enthralled by the view of her world
from above) <br>
MIRASTA: It's everything I've ever dreamed of. When I was a child, my
parents would take me to the
planetarium and we would sit in the dark and it was as if I was on a
spaceship, on my way to another world to meet people on other planets.
Part of me keeps waiting for the lights to come up and the programme to
end. How did you know about me? <br>
PICARD: We learn as much as possible about a planet before we make
first contact. <br>
TROI: One of the things we monitor are your broadcast signals, your
journalism, your music, your humour. Try to better understand you as a
people. <br>
MIRASTA: I hate to think how you would judge us based on our popular
music and entertainment. <br>
PICARD: Indeed, we do get an incomplete picture, which is why we also
do surface reconnaissance. <br>
MIRASTA: You've had people on our planet? <br>
TROI: For several years. <br>
PICARD: These are specialists, highly trained observation teams,
superficially identical to yourselves and therefore able to blend
naturally into your society. You see, we have discovered that the most
hazardous aspect of these missions is a lack of sufficient information <br>
MIRASTA: You don't have to explain. I understand, although not
everybody on my planet would. They
would think you were trying to infiltrate our society. <br>
PICARD: There is a difficulty here, one that has forced us to
accelerate this entire process. One of our people is missing. My First
Officer, Commander William Riker. He was down on the planet surface,
coordinating with the observation team the final details of contact. He
disappeared. My people have made enquiries but they've not been able to
locate him. If there is anything you can help <br>
MIRASTA: Of course. Where was Riker's last known location? <br>
TROI: The capital city. He was under the name of Rivas Jakara, a
tourist from the Marta community. <br>
MIRASTA: We must find him before someone realises what he really is. If
this gets out prematurely, it could seriously complicate matters. Our
ideology is based on the assumption that the Malcorian is a supreme
lifeform, and our world is the centre of the universe. Your arrival
will change our entire understanding of life, and some will not want it
to change. <br>
PICARD: What about Durken? <br>
MIRASTA: Durken. He will be open-minded, but cautious. I strongly
suggest that you do not discuss your surveillance teams with him. At
least not right away. <br>
PICARD: But with the disappearance of Commander Riker, wouldn't it be
prudent <br>
MIRASTA: Captain Picard, I must ask you to trust me on this. If you
tell the Chancellor about Commander Riker, you will undermine
everything that you hope to accomplish here. Durken will assign Krola,
our Minister of Security, to find him. Krola has his own political
agenda. He will perceive you as the greatest threat that our people
have ever known. And he will not hesitate to use Riker to prove that he
is correct. </font></p>

confirm anything you told us. No physician named Crusher is on file.
Not on this planet. Your address in Marta's an eating establishment.
The cook has never heard of Rivas Jakara. <br>
RIKER: Obviously there's been some misunderstanding. <br>
BEREL: There's a growing number of people on the other side of that
door who believe you are not one of us, Mister Jakara. <br>
RIKER: Not one of you? <br>
BEREL: That you are from another planet. Are you, Mister Jakara? <br>
RIKER: Do you realise what you're saying? <br>
BEREL: I know how it sounds. I'm not anxious to make a fool of myself.
This new era of space flight, it fires the imagination. People see
unidentified vessels in the sky that turn out to be weather balloons. <br>
RIKER: Well, it's far more likely that I am a weather balloon than an
alien. <br>
BEREL: Our medical journals have documented several cases of genetic
mutation in recent history.
Some unusual physical disfigurations have occurred. <br>
RIKER: I'm another case for the medical journals, then. <br>
BEREL: Perhaps. But you, Mister Jakara, are hiding something, and
unless you tell me the truth about yourself, this rumour will persist
and grow and could even become dangerous. Most especially to you.

really quite good at it. Chancellor, we have a tradition called a
toast. It is a drink to salute one's friends and good fortune, and I
would like to propose a toast to a new friendship. <br>

language I appreciate and understand, but I have learned to not always

PICARD: We will leave and never return. Chancellor, we are here only to
help guide you into a new era. I can assure you we will not interfere
in the natural development of your planet. That is, in fact, our Prime
Directive. <br>
DURKEN: I can infer from that directive that you do not intend to share
all this exceptional technology with us. <br>
PICARD: That is not the whole meaning, but it is part of it. <br>
DURKEN: Is this your way of maintaining superiority? <br>
PICARD: Chancellor, to instantly transform a society with technology
would be harmful and it would be destructive, <br>
DURKEN: You're right, of course. I'm overwhelmed, Captain Picard. I'm
quite overwhelmed. I go home each night to a loving wife, two beautiful
daughters. We eat the evening meal together as a family, I think that's
important. And they always ask me if I've had a good day. <br>

DURKEN: Yes, she's tried to accept the responsibility. <br>
PICARD: It was my error, not hers. Chancellor, there is no starship
mission more dangerous than that of first contact. We never know what
we will face when we open the door on a new world, how we will be
greeted, what exactly the dangers will be. Centuries ago, a disastrous
contact with the Klingon Empire led to decades of war. It was decided
then we would do surveillance before making contact. It was a
controversial decision. I believe it prevented more problems than it
created. <br>
DURKEN: I can appreciate the logic of your position, Captain. But it
would seem a full disclosure after contact would have been in order. <br>
PICARD: In time there would have been full disclosure. I can only ask
you to believe that. On other worlds it would not be an issue. But
here, everything our observers reported indicated that the people of
this world would almost certainly react negatively to our arrival. We
could see that even surveillance might even be interpreted as an act of
aggression. I hoped that we would have found Commander Riker before you
did so the matter would not complicate our introduction. It was a
mistake. <br>
DURKEN: Yes. A mistake I might have made in your place. I rather like
it actually. <br>
PICARD: Like it? <br>
DURKEN: That you make mistakes like any man. <br>
PICARD: Chancellor, I have made some fine ones in my time. Now, I must
ask you, will you release my officer? <br>
DURKEN: We'll talk again later, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Enterprise, one to beam up.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BEREL: Yes I understand. <br>
(he puts the telephone down) <br>
BEREL: I have been relieved of my duties, as I'm sure you already know.
You are Acting Director of the facility, Nilrem. <br>
(Berel leaves) <br>
KROLA: Revive him. <br>
(Nilrem prepares the injection, and Mirasta leaves too. Nilrem checks
the various monitors) <br>
KROLA: Leave us. <br>
(Nilrem leaves) <br>
KROLA: I am Minister Krola of Internal Security. You are Riker, an
alien. Yes, we know. <br>
RIKER: Please bring my people here. <br>
KROLA: In time. In time. But first I need to ask you some questions.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Durken's office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIRASTA: Thank you for seeing me. <br>
DURKEN: If I did not depend so much on your expertise in space matters,
I would have asked for your resignation. <br>
MIRASTA: I felt I was acting in the best interests of our people,
Chancellor. <br>
DURKEN: When you are selected to occupy this office, then you will have
the privilege of deciding the best interests of our people. Picard I
can excuse, but you, Mirasta, you should have trusted me. <br>
MIRASTA: Chancellor, we must release Riker to Picard Any hope for a
relationship with these people depends on it. <br>
DURKEN: I can't afford to be the idealist you are, Mirasta. <br>
MIRASTA: Riker <br>
DURKEN: I am prepared to release Riker after we have interrogated him. <br>
MIRASTA: Are you prepared for him to die, Chancellor? His injuries are
extremely serious. A mob at the medical facility almost killed him.
Krola has ordered drugs to be used to revive him for questioning, drugs
that in his condition would be dangerous for him. Without medical aid
from his ship, I believe that Riker will not survive the day. You must
tell Picard where he is.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Riker's hospital room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KROLA: You have lied since the moment of your
capture and I believe you are lying now, Commander. <br>
RIKER: No. We're here on a mission of peace. <br>
KROLA: Such noble creatures. Why do peaceful people develop such lethal
weapons? Or do you still insist it's just a toy? <br>
(Krola fires the phaser at an instrument stand) <br>
KROLA: An interesting toy, to be sure. <br>
RIKER: It's only used for defence. <br>
KROLA: Perhaps, like many conquerors, you believe your goals to be
benevolent. I cannot. For however you would describe your intentions,
you still represent the end to my way of life. I cannot permit that to
occur. Eventually, Durken would choose to welcome your people with arms
open and eyes closed. I must force him down another path. <br>
(he puts the phaser in Riker's hand) <br>
KROLA: When they find us, I will be dead, killed by your weapon. The
lines will be drawn. A peaceful accord will no longer be an option. <br>
RIKER: No. <br>
KROLA: For my people. <br>
(and the weapon goes off) <br>
(Tava and Nilrem enter) <br>
TAVA: What happened? <br>
NILREM: He shot him. The alien shot Krola. <br>
(Tava gets on the emergency phone) <br>
TAVA: Get me three octares of adrulmine, high frequency EM charge unit
now! <br>
NILREM: I have a circulation pattern. It's very weak. We have to get
him on vital buffers right now <br>
(Crusher, Worf and a medic beam in)&nbsp;<br>
CRUSHER: I'm a physician, don't be frightened. I need to know what
happened. Are you doctors? <br>
TAVA: Yes. He shot him. <br>
NILREM: With that thing. <br>
CRUSHER: Crusher to Picard. <br>
PICARD [OC]: Go ahead, Doctor. <br>
CRUSHER: Commander Riker is near death. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Durken's office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER [OC]: But there's still some brain
activity. I need to get him back to the ship. <br>
PICARD: Acknowledged. <br>
CRUSHER [OC]: And there's a Malconian male with a phaser wound in his
upper chest. I need to get him back as well. <br>
PICARD: We'll meet you on the Enterprise. Picard out.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Picard, Durken and Mirasta enter) <br>
CRUSHER: They're both going to be okay. We were able to stabilise Will.
If we had been any later <br>
DURKEN: Krola? <br>
CRUSHER: He was never in any real danger. The phaser was on stun. <br>
MIRASTA: Stun? <br>
PICARD: It's a defensive weapon. Have you been able to ascertain what
happened? <br>
CRUSHER: Based on the angle of impact, it suggests that Krola's left
hand was on the phaser when it went off, <br>
DURKEN: They were struggling for the weapon? <br>
CRUSHER: Commander Riker was in no position to offer any kind of
struggle, Chancellor. <br>
MIRASTA: Krola was trying to be a martyr? <br>
KROLA: Where is this? <br>
DURKEN: You're aboard the starship, my foolish old friend. <br>
KROLA: No. Chancellor, you must not. You must not pursue relations with
them. You must not. <br>
DURKEN: I know. I know.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ready room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIRASTA: But Chancellor <br>
DURKEN: Mirasta, it goes against every instinct in my being. My people
are not ready to accept what you represent.
Everything that happened in the hospital proves it. And Krola is the
best evidence of all. We must slow down and allow all those like him to
join us in the present before we can move into the future. <br>
MIRASTA: But when we encounter other beings in space, our people must
be ready. <br>
DURKEN: The warp programme will have to be delayed. We will divert more
resources to education and social development to prepare for the day
when we are ready. <br>
MIRASTA: Chancellor, I strongly disagree. <br>
DURKEN: I know. Captain, you once said if I ask you to leave, you would
without hesitation. I'm afraid I must ask you to do just that. <br>
PICARD: Well, it's your decision, Chancellor. But I must say, I regret
that I won't have the opportunity of knowing your people better. <br>
DURKEN: We're a good people, Captain. A society with much potential.
Once we cross the threshold of space, we will have to give up this
self-importance, this conceit that we are the centre of the universe.
But this is not the time for that. For now, we will have to enjoy that
sweet innocence. <br>
PICARD: How will you keep us a secret when so many have seen and heard
so much? <br>
DURKEN: The stories will be told for many years, I have no doubt. Of
the ship that made contact, of an alien who was held prisoner in the
medical facility. There'll be charges of a government conspiracy. Some
of the witnesses will tell their tales and most people will laugh at
them, and go back and watch more interesting fiction of the daily
broadcasts. It will pass. <br>
MIRASTA: I'm sorry to say he's probably right. Captain Picard, I have
one last request. Take me with you. <br>
DURKEN: She will be unhappy with the restrictions I must place on her
at home, Captain. <br>
PICARD: We may not be back here in your lifetime. And I have to believe
that you cannot be fully prepared for the realities of space travel. <br>
MIRASTA: I have been prepared for the realities of space since I was
nine years old, and sitting in a planetarium. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf to my Ready room. <br>
(Worf enters) <br>
PICARD: Escort Chancellor Durken to the transporter room, Lieutenant.
And assign quarters to Minister Yale. She will be remaining on board. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Until we return, then. <br>
DURKEN: With luck, we'll both be around to renew our friendship,
Captain. </font> </p>
