arena. There are lights on his gloves and boots, and a disc on his
chest. The crowd goes wild. Then his opponent enters - an Hirogen. A
deep tone signals the start of the bout. They circle, then start
hitting. The Hirogen knocks the other down, but gets kicked on the
chest disc. There is a Zap! sound. More kicking, punching and dodging,
then the Hirogen lands two good blows, and two more. His opponent is
out for the count. In the crowd, Chakotay and Torres applaud.)<br><br>Captain's log, stardate

You may want to run a diagnostic on the shield generators. It's way

the mess hall. <br>
CHAKOTAY: He's still trying to enhance the plasma burners in his stove?
<br>
JANEWAY: With some of Seven's Borg technology. I don't want him
accidentally turning the galley into an assimilation chamber. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'll assign a security detail to keep tabs on him. Unless you
think we need to take more drastic measures? <br>
JANEWAY: And most important, be sure to tell your Captain when she's
being overprotective. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'll do that. <br>
JANEWAY: Thanks again for minding the store. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Even the captain deserves a vacation once in a while. <br>

NEELIX: I was so excited to visit one of those beautiful Norcadian

under two suns. <br>(Neelix is very pink.)<br>
TORRES: Ouch. <br>
NEELIX: A little more colour than I was hoping for, but it'll be a

TORRES: Well, we've spent the last few days at the Tsunkatse matches. <br>
NEELIX: Tsunkatse. I heard some crewmen talking about that during
breakfast. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's exciting. A real test of strength and agility. <br>

TUVOK: I have other plans. There's a micro-nebula approximately one
point six light years from here on the verge of collapse. <br>

SEVEN: Approximately forty eight hours. <br>

PARIS: She over-packs too. <br>
SEVEN: I haven't over-packed. I simply wish to be prepared for any
contingency. <br>
PARIS: And what contingency is this for? <br>
SEVEN: That's an iso-modulator, enhanced to correct hull ablation in
the event we encounter a meteoroid stream. <br>
PARIS: Couldn't you just replicate an iso-modulator? <br>
SEVEN: I prefer this one. <br>
PARIS: Oh, I get it. You like to have your own things with you.
B'Elanna's the same way. You know, she'd never admit it, but she still
takes a stuffed animal with her whenever she's going to be away for
more than a day. Toby the Targ. <br>

Just the person I was looking for. <br>

Norcadia's cultural hot spots. I hear their museums are among the
finest in this sector. <br>
SEVEN: I'm busy. <br>
EMH: With what? <br>
SEVEN: Commander Tuvok and I are leaving to study a collapsing
micro-nebula. <br>
EMH: During shore leave? I thought we'd discussed this. Shore leave is
a perfect opportunity for you to spend time with other members of the
crew, to develop your social skills. <br>
SEVEN: Then I suppose I'll have to develop them with Commander Tuvok. <br>
EMH: Vulcans aren't exactly known for their winning personalities. <br>
SEVEN: You'd prefer I spent my time with sociable individuals such as
yourself. <br>
EMH: You could do worse. <br>
SEVEN: In that case, perhaps you'd care to join us. <br>
EMH: To study the micro-nebula? <br>
SEVEN: You can assist us with our analysis of veridium oxide
particulates. <br>
EMH: On second thought, you and Tuvok have a good time. <br>
SEVEN: I'll give the Commander your regrets. <br>
EMH: Do that. And if the nebula isn't as riveting as you'd hoped, try
to remember lesson thirty six. Pleasant Parlour Games To Pass The Time.

Two hours, thirty seven minutes, thirteen seconds. That's how long
we've gone without verbal communication. <br>
TUVOK: Why is that remarkable? <br>
SEVEN: The Doctor encourages me to engage in conversation during
awkward silences. <br>
TUVOK: Did you find the silence awkward? <br>
SEVEN: No. <br>
TUVOK: Nor did I. <br>

configuration is unfamiliar. <br>

SEVEN: No response. <br>(The much bigger ship is coming up on them from astern.)<br>
TUVOK: Tuvok to Voyager. <br>
SEVEN: The vessel is emitting some kind of dampening field. We've lost
engines, weapons, shields. <br>(The shuttlecraft goes dark, then an object is beamed in. Tuvok scans it.)<br>
TUVOK: It's an explosive device of some sort. <br>
SEVEN: Transporters are down. I can't beam it off. <br>

Borg-enhanced physiology. You should possess superior strength,
agility, stamina, and visual acuity. Welcome to Tsunkatse. Since the
game's inception our audience has never had the pleasure of seeing a
drone compete. You are going to be a very popular attraction. <br>
SEVEN: Where is Commander Tuvok? <br>
PENK: Your comrade from the shuttle? I'm afraid he was injured in the

SEVEN: I have no intention of participating in your game. <br>
PENK: Aggressive. I like that. <br>(Tuvok is helped into the room.)<br>
SEVEN: He requires medical attention. <br>
PENK: That can be arranged. <br>
SEVEN: Then arrange it. <br>
PENK: You haven't won a single bout, and already you're making demands
like a champion. <br>
SEVEN: Will you treat him or not? <br>
PENK: Will you fight? <br>
TUVOK: Do not comply. My condition is not severe. <br>(He has nasty burns.)<br>
PENK: Spoken like a true competitor, willing to ignore his injuries for
the sake of the contest. Schedule a bout for him. A Red Match against
the Pensarkan. <br>

killed. Your friend would not survive. <br>

KIM: He lost his last two times out. <br>
CHAKOTAY: But he's undefeated against left-handed fighters. <br>
PARIS: You should trust him, Harry. Chakotay knows a thing or two about

demonstration of athletic prowess. <br>

you can find some way to occupy your free time that doesn't involve

protect them. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm glad you're enjoying yourself. <br>
NEELIX: I still don't understand the rules. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's simple. A Tsunkatse fighter wears a polaron disruptor on
both hands and feet. Each disruptor delivers a bio-plasmic charge when
it comes in contact one of the opponent's target sensors. <br>
NEELIX: So there is strategy involved? <br>
CHAKOTAY: A fighter has to attack his rival's sensors without exposing
his own. <br>
PARIS: Are you two going to talk, or you here to watch? <br>(Enter the Champion. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, with a bit of an alien forehead. He raises an eyebrow and the crowd go wild.)<br>

NEELIX: I'm not. I spoke to one of the Pendari delegates. According to
him, a huge percentage of the planet's revenue is derived from
Tsunkatse. Nobody wants to do anything that might interfere with the
game. <br>
CHAKOTAY: So they turn a blind eye to the recruitment tactics. <br>
NEELIX: We're not going to get any help through official channels. It's
hard to believe, a civilisation whose favourite pastime is cheering
while innocent people fight each other. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Turbolift]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CHAKOTAY:
If Seven and Tuvok hadn't been abducted, we might still be cheering
too.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CHAKOTAY:
What have you got? <br>
TORRES: Well, one of the reasons we were having trouble isolating the
source of the transmissions was because they never seem to be coming
from the same place twice. At first we thought the matches were being
held in various locations. <br>
KIM: But when we connected the dots, we realised that the pattern
conformed to a flight path. <br>
TORRES: One that spanned the entire sector. <br>
CHAKOTAY: They're transmitting the fights from a ship. <br>
NEELIX: Like a travelling carnival. <br>
KIM: Oh, this is no carnival. Five million metric tons, reinforced hull
plating protected by covariant shielding. Neutronic weaponry. <br>
TORRES: It's way out of our weight class. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The bigger they come, Lieutenant. Transmit these coordinates
to the Captain. Tell her we could use a hand. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>{Tsunkatse

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Seven goes through solo moves.)<br>HIROGEN:
Excellent. When your opponent enters the arena, what do you see? <br>
SEVEN: My prey. <br>
HIROGEN: And what do you do to your prey? <br>
SEVEN: Hunt it down and kill it. <br>
HIROGEN: Go rest before your match. <br>
SEVEN: Thank you. <br>
HIROGEN: Thank me by winning. (Seven goes to Tuvok, who is working on a control panel.)<br>
SEVEN: Penk's guards are making their inspection rounds. Progress? <br>
TUVOK: Both the dampening field and the shielding of this vessel are
tetryon-based, but without access to the control interface I can't
disable either. Your training? <br>
SEVEN: Complete. <br>
TUVOK: Are you adequately prepared? <br>
SEVEN: The Hirogen is an efficient instructor. He believes I'll win. <br>
TUVOK: That troubles you? <br>
SEVEN: The idea of killing someone for the entertainment of others is
detestable. <br>
TUVOK: Is the idea of losing your own life for the entertainment of
others more palatable? As a drone, you took many lives. <br>
SEVEN: I was acting as part of the Collective. <br>
TUVOK: You're worried you won't have the strength to accomplish the
task on your own. <br>
SEVEN: I'm worried that I will. <br>(Penk enters.)<br>
PENK: It's time. <br>
TUVOK: Do whatever it takes to survive.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Seven enters to boos from the crowd. She crosses the pit and waits for her opponent. The Hirogen enters to cheers.)<br>SEVEN:
You knew. <br>
HIROGEN: Yes. <br>(The signal for the bout to start. They circle each other.)<br>
SEVEN: Training me was a deception. You wished to familiarise yourself
with my weaknesses. <br>
HIROGEN: I was helping you to overcome them. <br>
SEVEN: Why? <br>
HIROGEN: Nineteen years is a long time. I've grown tired. <br>
SEVEN: You wish to be killed in the arena? <br>
HIROGEN: I want a death my son would be proud of. <br>
SEVEN: I won't be the one to provide it. <br>
HIROGEN: Then I'll be forced to kill you.<br>(The fight starts, and the Hirogen gets in the first blow.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
Approaching the vessel. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Take us out of warp. Raise shields and charge weapons. Any
sign of Tuvok and Seven? <br>
KIM: Our sensors can't penetrate their shields. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Hail them. <br>
PENK [on viewscreen]: This is not a convenient time. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm Commander Chakotay of the Starship Voyager. You're
holding two of my people. <br>
PENK [on viewscreen]: You'll have to be more specific. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Commander Tuvok and Seven of Nine. Return them. Now. <br>
PENK [on viewscreen]: The Borg drone and her friend. I'm afraid she's
occupied at the moment. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You have thirty seconds before I open fire. <br>
PENK: A fighter. I respect that. But you're no match for me.

We can still find another way out of this. <br>
HIROGEN: There is no other way. You're still dropping your elbow. <br>(He twists her arm behind her back.)<br>HIROGEN: Make
a choice. Hunter or Prey? Hunter or Prey?<br>(She kicks herself free and retaliates. They trade blows. Voyager shoots at Penk's vessel.)

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TORRES:
Direct hit to their aft shield generators. <br>
KIM: Still no sign of Seven, but I've got a lock on Tuvok. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Beam him to Sickbay. Keep targeting those generators. <br>
KIM: Transport complete. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Bridge to Tuvok. <br>

KIM: Still can't get a lock. <br>
PARIS: Should I get us out of here before they knock out our

CHAKOTAY: Not yet. If we can't beam her out, maybe we can shut down the
transmission. <br>
PARIS: If nobody's watching, then why continue the fight? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Start targeting their signal generators. <br>
KIM: Hull breach on deck eleven. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Seal it.<br>(Seven is starting to get the upper hand, and the crowd are going with her.)<br>

We located an Hirogen hunting party three light years away. They've
agreed to rendezvous with us. <br>

EMH: Very well. But if you should need anything, an analgesic, a phaser
rifle, don't hesitate to ask. <br>
SEVEN: I apologise for the Doctor. He's very protective of me. <br>
HIROGEN: He doesn't realise how well you defend yourself. <br>(He removes his chest sensor.)<br>HIROGEN:&nbsp;A trophy. <br>
SEVEN: What will do you now, search for new prey? <br>
HIROGEN: No. This time I will be searching for my son. <br>
SEVEN: If he is as clever as his father, he may be difficult to locate.

SEVEN: Thank you. <br>
TUVOK: I realise we share an affinity for silences, but in this
instance I feel compelled to speak. If you hadn't offered to take my
place in the arena, it's likely I would have been killed. <br>
SEVEN: I made the logical choice, as you would have. <br>
TUVOK: Still, I owe you a debt of gratitude. <br>
SEVEN: Assisting me with these recalibrations will be sufficient
thanks. <br>
TUVOK: Have you fully recovered? <br>
SEVEN: I'm experiencing minor pain beneath my occipital implant. The Doctor believes it is temporary. <br>
TUVOK: I wasn't referring to your physical condition. <br>
SEVEN: When the Hirogen referred to me as weak, he was correct. <br>
TUVOK: But you overpowered him. <br>
SEVEN: Because I lost control. <br>
TUVOK: Given the circumstances, your behaviour was understandable. <br>
SEVEN: I've spent the last three years struggling to regain my
humanity. I'm afraid I may have lost it again in that arena. <br>
TUVOK: You're experiencing difficult emotions. <br>
SEVEN: Guilt, shame, remorse. <br>
TUVOK: Then you haven't lost your humanity. You have reaffirmed it. </font>
