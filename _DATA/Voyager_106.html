help us shorten our journey home. Ensign Kim has reported an exciting
discovery. A subspace disturbance which may be a wormhole. </font>

(Janeway enters. Tuvok and Chakotay are at Kim's station.) <br>
JANEWAY: Let's see what you have, Mister Kim.<br>
KIM: There. It's registering only on subspace bands. We don't even have
it on long range sensors yet.<br>
JANEWAY: Verteron emanations. Tunnelling secondary particles. It
certainly looks like a wormhole.<br>
CHAKOTAY: But is it stable enough for us to enter, and if it is, where
does it lead?<br>
TUVOK: There is, of course, a seventy five percent chance the wormhole
will not lead to the Alpha Quadrant.<br>
JANEWAY: Very true. But you can also say there's a one in four chance
it will. Those aren't bad odds. Any analysis yet, Ensign?<br>
KIM: Too far away. We'd have to be within a thousand kilometres to get
a detailed analysis. That would mean a significant course change.<br>
JANEWAY: Well, Mister Kim, if there's even the possibility of finding a
wormhole, I think we can afford a detour. Lieutenant, input the
coordinates and change course.<br>
PARIS: Aye, Captain. And may I suggest, if this works, we petition the
Federation Astronomical Committee to officially designate this the
Harry Kim Wormhole.<br>
(Later.) <br>
PARIS: Captain, we're approaching the coordinates of the wormhole.<br>
JANEWAY: On screen. Are we in visual range?<br>
KIM: Affirmative, Captain, and the anomaly is still registering on
subspace bands.<br>
PARIS: Sensors also indicate it's there.<br>
JANEWAY: Magnify. Increase to highest magnification.<br>
CHAKOTAY: If that's a wormhole, it must be the smallest one on record.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Kim, are you able to analyse it?<br>
KIM: Aye Captain. It's virtually microscopic. The aperture is only
about thirty centimetres in diameter.<br>
PARIS: I guess it's a little too small for us to fly through.<br>
TUVOK: However, it might be large enough to act as a conduit for a
message.<br>
KIM: That's right. It could carry a compressed data transmission to
Federation space in minutes.<br>
JANEWAY: We still have to find out if it goes anywhere near the Alpha
Quadrant. Can you trace it's subspace bearing?<br>
KIM: I can't get any directional readings at all. The aperture is too
small.<br>
TUVOK: I recommend we launch a microprobe into the wormhole.<br>
JANEWAY: Agreed. Do it, Lieutenant.<br>
TUVOK: Aye, Captain.<br>
(Whoosh.) <br>
KIM: We're receiving telemetry.<br>
(The viewscreen shows a green tunnel.) <br>
PARIS: It doesn't look like any wormhole I've ever studied.<br>
KIM: Microscopic gravitational eddies, extremely constricted spatial
dimensions. The pathway's barely wider than the probe itself.<br>
JANEWAY: I think what we're seeing is a wormhole in an advanced state
of decay. Must be ancient. Probably been collapsing for centuries.<br>
PARIS: Does that mean we can't send a message through it?<br>
KIM: No, I can do it. Maybe it'll take longer to get through, but the
wormhole's still stable enough to carry a transmission.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Any idea yet where that message would end up, Ensign?<br>
KIM: I'll try extrapolating the verteron exit vector. No, I can't get
it. There's a strange phase variance in the radiation stream. We'll
have to wait until the probe exits.<br>
JANEWAY: That shouldn't take long.<br>
PARIS: Captain, I'm getting a distorted energy reading.<br>
TUVOK: The probe's telemetry has changed.<br>
KIM: It's stuck.<br>
JANEWAY: Stuck?<br>
KIM: It's mired in a gravitational eddy, and because the wormhole's in
a state of collapse, those eddies are incredibly dense. That probe will
never break free, Captain, and we'll have no way of finding out where
the wormhole ends.<br>
JANEWAY: Let's give it some time. Maybe it will work itself loose.<br>
KIM: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: What is it, Ensign.<br>
KIM: Our probe was just scanned. There's somebody on the other side of
the wormhole. </font></p>

Doctor and new assistant Kes have a patient - a man with a sore wrist.)
<br>
BAXTER: It started acting up a couple of days ago. I'd been working out
in the gym, maybe I overdid it.<br>
EMH: Is it sore here?<br>
BAXTER: Yes.<br>
EMH: Localised tenderness to the ulna bone, no epidermal damage,
moderate oedema. What are the possible diagnoses?<br>
KES: Epicondylitis, strained ligament, torn muscle and hairline
fracture.<br>
EMH: That's exactly right.<br>
KES: I've studied all the material you gave me. I'm ready for more.<br>
EMH: Good. There's a great deal more for you to learn. The tricorder
indicates this is a small stress fracture.<br>
BAXTER: Can this guy do everything a real doctor does?<br>
(The EMH hands a device to Kes.) <br>
EMH: Yes, he can. Activate it and direct the beam here. That's it. Not
quite so fast.<br>
BAXTER: If I had to get treatment for something serious, if I needed
surgery for instance, would he be performing it?<br>
EMH: Of course, and quite expertly too.<br>
BAXTER: I don't know. I'd have to think twice about that.<br>
EMH: Fine. And if you were lucky you wouldn't die on the table while
you were making up your mind. That should do it. How does it feel?<br>
BAXTER: Not bad. Thanks.<br>

Doctor, did you notice how rudely that officer treated you?<br>
EMH: Not more so than most.<br>
KES: You mean others act that way too.<br>
EMH: Let's just say I've become accustomed to being treated like a
hypospray. Now, here's some material on first aid for burns.<br>
KES: Doctor, I think I'd like to do more than study first aid. I'd be
interested in knowing more about anatomy and physiology.<br>
EMH: You're intellectually curious. I like that. These deal with human
anatomy and physiology, but they weren't written for the layman.
They're quite technical.<br>
(Kes looks over the set of PADDs.) <br>
KES: I understand. I'll do my best. And I really appreciate your help. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Briefing
Room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
We've analysed the data. So far our sensors have detected four separate
scans of the microprobe, each one on a progressively narrower band.
Someone on the other end of that wormhole is definitely interested in
that probe.<br>
TUVOK: We cannot preclude the possibility that there is a microscopic
entity within the wormhole curious about an intruder.<br>
KIM: That's possible, but you'd think our probe would have detected
something like that.<br>
JANEWAY: What's the condition of the probe now?<br>
TORRES: I've been monitoring it from Engineering. It's still embedded
in a gravitational eddy, but within seventy two hours it will be
crushed.<br>
KIM: But until then it should continue to transmit telemetry.<br>
JANEWAY: If we're reading scans from the other side, it's possible the
probe is acting as a relay. If that's true, we should be able to use it
to transmit a message to whoever is executing the scan.<br>
KIM: Yes. I can modify our subspace communications band to accept the
probe as a booster.<br>
JANEWAY: Let's try it, Mister Kim.<br>
TORRES: I'll give you a hand.<br>
(Kim and Torres leave.) <br>
TUVOK: I fear Mister Kim's exuberance may turn into an equally intense
disappointment if his efforts prove in vain.<br>
JANEWAY: You may be right, but I'd rather assume that he's going to be
successful. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
Okay, I've boosted power to the communications bandwidth. Now all we
have to do reconfigure the signal generator so it's compatible with the
probe's long range sensors.<br>
TORRES: I'm on it. Just a few minutes more.<br>
KIM: This has to work. It'll mean so much to people back home to know
we're alive and headed for Federation space.<br>
TORRES: We haven't been gone that long. People won't give up on us so
soon. They probably just think we're lost.<br>
KIM: It's still going to be hard on my folks. I always called them once
a week, even when I was on my training missions. I've never been out of
contact for so long.<br>
TORRES: Well, it is going to work, Starfleet, so pretty soon they're
going to know you're all right.<br>
KIM: How about you? Any family?<br>
TORRES: I haven't seen my father since I was five. He and my mother
separated. He went back to Earth and that was the last I saw of him.<br>
KIM: And your mom?<br>
TORRES: I think she's on the Klingon Homeworld.<br>
KIM: You think?<br>
TORRES: We didn't get along very well. Okay, the signal generator
should be tuned to the probe's long range sensors.<br>
KIM: Isn't there anyone back home who'll be worried about you?<br>
TORRES: The Maquis are as to a close family as I've ever had. Most of
my friends are here, on the ship, so no, there's no one back home who's
going to care one way or the other whether I'm alive. We're ready to
transmit.<br>

CHAKOTAY: I'm reading transmission of the test signal. The probe has
received it and relayed it.<br>

TUVOK: I'm getting something, Captain. <br>
PARIS: I'm getting it too. A subspace signal relayed through the probe.<br>
TUVOK: That signal is being transmitted at exactly the same frequency
and amplitude as our signal. It's a response. Someone received our
transmission and sent one back, and their signal originated in the
Alpha Quadrant. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Come in. Kes, this is a surprise.<br>
KES: Am I interrupting?<br>
JANEWAY: Not at all. I was just going to have a cup of soup. Would you
like anything?<br>
KES: Ah, spinach juice with a touch of pear, please. Tom Paris
introduced me to it, it's very nutritious.<br>
JANEWAY: I'm sure. Computer, one spinach juice with a touch of pear and
one cup of vegetable bouillon. What can I do for you?<br>
(They take their drinks to the settee.) <br>
KES: If there were a member of the crew whose needs weren't being met,
would you want to know about it?<br>
JANEWAY: Of course. Kes, do you and Neelix feel that your needs are
being ignored?<br>
KES: Of course not, we're very happy here. I'm referring to the Doctor.<br>
JANEWAY: The Doctor?<br>
KES: I don't understand why people treat him the way they do.<br>
JANEWAY: How do people treat him?<br>
KES: As though he doesn't exist. They talk about him while he's
standing right there. They ignore him. They insult him.<br>
JANEWAY: Well as a matter of fact, I've been hearing the other side of
the coin. Many of the crew have complained that the Doctor is brusque,
even rude, that he lacks any bedside manner. We've been talking about
reprogramming him.<br>
KES: You can do that? It doesn't seem right.<br>
JANEWAY: Kes, he's only a hologram.<br>
KES: He's your Medical Officer. He's alive.<br>
JANEWAY: No he's not.<br>
KES: He's self aware, he's communicative, he has the ability to learn.<br>
JANEWAY: Because he's been programmed to do that.<br>
KES: So because he's a hologram he doesn't have to be treated with
respect or any consideration at all?<br>
JANEWAY: Very well, I'll look into it.<br>
KES: Thank you, Captain. </font></p>

Engineering station 2, scan analysis 21166 shows the wormhole.) <br>
KIM: Okay, we'll be ready to go online in a couple of minutes.<br>
TORRES: I'm still worried about the gravitational interference. I don't
think the co-variant isolator will be effective with a vocal
transmission.<br>
KIM: Let's try inverting the narrow band filter.<br>
(Janeway enters from her Ready room.) <br>
JANEWAY: Progress report, Ensign.<br>
KIM: I think we're ready to give it a try, though we're pushing through
some pretty heavy gravitational interference. I can't guarantee the
clarity of the transmission.<br>
JANEWAY: Let's see what happens. This is Captain Kathryn Janeway of the
Federation Starship Voyager. Do you read?<br>
(Static garble.) <br>
TORRES: I'll narrow the filter bandpass some more. Try again, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: This is Kathryn Janeway of the Federation ship Voyager. Is
anyone receiving this communication?<br>
TELEK [OC]: (skreech, gurgle) vessel (gurgle) <br>
KIM: Narrow the bandpass some more. Try again, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: This is Janeway. Please repeat your last transmission.<br>
TELEK [OC]: (gurgle) cargo vessel (gurgle) quadrant (gurgle) your
location.<br>
JANEWAY: Cargo vessel, we're still trying to clear up your last
transmission. Please repeat one more time.<br>
TELEK [OC]: I am Captain of the cargo vessel Talvath, location Alpha
Quadrant, sector one three eight five. What is your location?<br>
JANEWAY: We're in the Delta Quadrant, but since this quadrant hasn't
been charted I can't specify our exact location.<br>
TELEK [OC]: Please confirm. You said Delta Quadrant?<br>
JANEWAY: Correct.<br>
TELEK [OC]: In a Federation starship?<br>
JANEWAY: Yes. We were on a mission and we got pulled into this quadrant.<br>
TELEK [OC]: Pulled in? How?<br>
JANEWAY: It's a complicated story. Please, if you would just try
deconstructing the phase shift of our hailing frequency you could
verify.<br>
TELEK [OC]: You are undoubtedly still in the Alpha quadrant. What are
your coordinates?<br>
JANEWAY: I assure you I am telling you the truth. We are in the Delta
quadrant, seventy thousand light years from you.<br>
TELEK [OC]: This is preposterous. You are obviously lying. I am
terminating communication.<br>
JANEWAY: No, no, wait! Kim! Hail them again.<br>
KIM: No response, Captain.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Why would he have broken off transmission?<br>
TUVOK: Perhaps I can offer an explanation. The comm. link signature of
his transmission indicates the message originated from a Romulan ship.
Further, there are no known shipping lanes in the sector he identified.
Given the precise calibration of his signal I would suggest that he is
in fact on board a science vessel.<br>
PARIS: Why would he pretend to be a cargo captain.<br>
CHAKOTAY: If he's engaged in some kind of secret research he might want
to conceal that fact.<br>
TUVOK: Precisely. When we claimed to be transmitting from the Delta
quadrant, an impossibility so far as he knows, he may have feared we
were Federation spies.<br>
TORRES: Just our luck. We raise one ship from the Alpha quadrant and it
has to be Romulan.<br>
JANEWAY: That Romulan still has the ability to get a message to
Starfleet. Mister Kim, hail the Talvath repeatedly. Call me the minute
you re-establish contact. Commander, you have the bridge.<br>

pulled against our will to our present location. Now we're trying to
get home.<br>
TELEK [OC]: Aren't you in fact Starfleet spies on a surveillance
mission?<br>
JANEWAY: Captain, I understand your concern. Naturally the Romulan
Empire doesn't want Starfleet spying on it's science vessels, but since
we're seventy thousand light years from Romulan space and a subspace
message to Starfleet would take years, I think you have to admit that
we can't be much of a threat to you. You have nothing to fear from us.<br>
TELEK [OC]: Soothing words, Captain, but they are only words.<br>
JANEWAY: If we were spies, we wouldn't be asking what I'm going to ask
you now. We have no way of communicating with Starfleet, with our
friends and families. We're hoping you might be able to relay a message
for us. Our crew is not large. Each of them could write a short
personal message. You'd be welcome to read them all before passing them
on. I think you'd be convinced that they're nothing more than the
heartfelt words of some very lonely people.<br>
TELEK [OC]: Captain, it would ease my apprehension if I could see that
you are who you say you are. I have a signal amplifier on board. I've

would be a price to pay. Perhaps I didn't realise how high that price
would be.<br>

family, loved ones. We may not see them again for years, maybe never,
so we can all understand how lonely you must be. Surely you must
understand our feelings as well. We would be deeply grateful for any
efforts you might make to persuade your government to send our messages.<br>
TELEK [on viewscreen]: I cannot guarantee success, but I will try to
persuade my superiors to make their decision quickly and positively.<br>
JANEWAY: Thank you.<br>
TELEK [on viewscreen]: I will contact you again.<br>
(Transmission ends.) <br>
JANEWAY: Commander, let's assume he's going to be successful. Tell the
crew to prepare personal messages and have them ready within the hour.<br>
CHAKOTAY: With pleasure, Captain.<br>
(Torres runs in.) <br>
TORRES: Captain, I have to talk to you.<br>
JANEWAY: Go ahead, Torres.<br>
TORRES: No. I mean, in private. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Ready
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
I think this will work, Captain, but I didn't want to bring it up in
front of the crew. It wouldn't be right to get their hopes up in case
it doesn't work, although I think it will.<br>
JANEWAY: Slow down, Torres, and tell me what you're talking about.<br>
TORRES: The phase amplitude of the visual link with the Romulan ship is
within just a few megahertz of meeting transporter protocols.<br>
JANEWAY: Are you suggesting <br>
TORRES: We might be able to piggyback a transporter beam onto the
visual link. We could transport the entire crew back to the Alpha
quadrant.<br>
JANEWAY: You'll have to reconfigure the matter transmission rate.<br>
TORRES: Fairly substantially.<br>
JANEWAY: And we risk losing whatever we try to beam out.<br>
TORRES: We'll have to run a series of tests first.<br>
JANEWAY: See to it, Lieutenant.<br>
TORRES: I'll need some help.<br>
JANEWAY: You have my authorisation to use any of the ships personnel
you need. This has top priority. And don't worry about secrecy. I doubt
you'd be able to keep this quiet for very long. <br>
(Torres leaves. Janeway picks up a photograph of a man and a dog, and
gazes longingly at it.) </font></p>

KES: I've finished these and I'm ready for more.<br>
EMH: You've finished those already?<br>
KES: I enjoyed studying anatomy. It would be interesting to see an
autopsy sometime.<br>
EMH: What are the bones of the middle ear?<br>
KES: Malleus, incus and stapes.<br>
EMH: And the connective tissue between the middle and the external
auditory canal?<br>
KES: The tympanic membrane.<br>
EMH: Hmm. I suspect you have an eidetic memory. An astonishing gift.
I'll do a full neural scan on you at some point. </font></p>

I've been thinking. If we do get back to Federation space, I'd like to
explore the possibility of going to Medical School.<br>
EMH: If you continue to apply yourself as you have, by the time we get
back you may already have the equivalent of a medical degree.<br>
KES: Then you haven't heard?<br>
EMH: Heard what?<br>
KES: That we might be getting back soon.<br>
EMH: If there's one thing you can count on, it's that I am the last to
be told about anything that happens on this ship.<br>
KES: Everyone's talking about it. There may be a way to transport all
of us to the Alpha Quadrant. Chief Torres and half of engineering are
working on it right now.<br>
EMH: I see. Well, I'll say goodbye now. I won't be transporting with
the rest of you.<br>
KES: But can't we download your programme and take you with us?<br>
EMH: My programme is fully integrated into the sickbay system. At
present I cannot be downloaded.<br>
(Kes kisses him on the cheek.) <br>
KES: Thank you for everything.<br>
EMH: Wait. I'd like. That is, could I ask a favour of you?<br>
KES: Anything.<br>
EMH: If you do leave, before you go, would you check to make sure I've
been deactivated.<br>
KES: I promise. </font></p>

JANEWAY: And our Chief Engineer has managed to bind a transporter beam
to the visual link between us.<br>
TELEK [on viewscreen]: Then you've matched your data transmission to
the phase amplitude of our comm. signal?<br>
JANEWAY: Exactly.<br>
TELEK [on viewscreen]: Apparently our intelligence operatives are not
doing their job. You clearly have technology that we are unaware of.
This would be an incredible breakthrough in subspace field mechanics.<br>
CHAKOTAY: If it's successful, we'd like to try transmitting a test
cylinder to you.<br>
TELEK [on viewscreen]: A test cylinder of what sort?<br>
TUVOK: It is a standard Starfleet mechanism with a varietal molecular
matrix. It simulates most organic and non-organic compounds. It is not
classified technology.<br>
TELEK [on viewscreen]: Ah, I am aware of this mechanism. We use a
similar device. I will allow the transport.<br>

TELEK [on viewscreen]: Congratulations, Captain. You've done it. Very
impressive.<br>
JANEWAY: We should run a series of these tests just to make sure, but
we have to act quickly before the probe is crushed.<br>
TELEK [on viewscreen]: I understand.<br>
JANEWAY: Eventually we will have to try transporting a person. One of
our crew will beam to your ship if you'll allow it.<br>
TELEK [on viewscreen]: I'm afraid I can't permit that, Captain, my
government would never allow Starfleet personnel on this ship. I
wouldn't want my logs to show that activity.<br>
TUVOK: Then what would you suggest?<br>
TELEK [on viewscreen]: I'll volunteer to transport to your ship and
back again.<br>
JANEWAY: But Captain, if we can't transport to your ship, how are we to
get back?<br>
TELEK [on viewscreen]: If the procedure is successful, I'll arrange for
a troop ship to join me. That would easily accommodate your crew.<br>
JANEWAY: Very well. We'll be in touch. </font></p>
