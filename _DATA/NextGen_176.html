Captain's log, Stardate 44143.7. We have moved into Sector two one nine
four seven in response to a distress call from a Talarian observation
craft. The alien vessel appears adrift, and our initial scans have
detected a life-threatening radiation leak within its propulsion
system.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: I get no further response from the vessel. <br>
PICARD: Maintain an open channel. <br>
RIKER: Doctor Crusher and her assistants are waiting in Transporter
room three. <br>
DATA: Sir, may I remind you that during the Galen border conflict, it
was a common tactic of the Talarians was to abandon their observation
craft, rig them to self destruct <br>
PICARD: And issue a general distress call. Yes, Mister Data, I know. <br>
DATA: That particular guerrilla manoeuvre resulted in two hundred and
nineteen fatalities over a three day period. <br>
RIKER: Is there any way to detect their self-destruct device? <br>
DATA: Negative, sir. The Talarians employ a subspace proximity
detonator. It is not detectable by our scans. <br>
RIKER: Or the away team's tricorders. Right. <br>
WORF: Captain, the Talarian warship the Q'Maire is responding to the
distress call. <br>
PICARD: Position? <br>
WORF: Halfway through the Woden sector. <br>
WESLEY: It'll take them hours to get here, sir, even at maximum warp. <br>
PICARD: Counsellor? <br>
TROI: There is life on board, but it's fading. <br>
PICARD: Number One, assemble the rest of your away team. Prepare for
immediate rescue operations. <br>

will evacuate you and give you medical care. You will not be harmed. <br>
CRUSHER: Enterprise, prepping five Talarian males for transport

hurt. I have a son not much older than you. Perhaps you'd like to meet
him. Well, Jono, you seem to have escaped radiation damage. Pretty
lucky. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: He managed to escape radiation trauma but
the scan shows something else. <br>
PICARD: What? <br>
CRUSHER: Two previously fractured ribs, a broken arm, and a low grade
concussion. There might be neurological impairment. I'd like to examine
him further. Jean-Luc, the Talarians have been known to be ruthless to
their enemies. I think there's a real possibility they may have
brutalised the child. <br>
PICARD: Isn't it possible the injuries were caused prior to his
captivity? <br>
CRUSHER: Not likely. He's been with them a long time. Long enough to
assimilate their cultural traits, and calcium trace patterns indicate
the injuries took place during the past seven years. <br>
PICARD: But if they have abused the boy, why would he so devoutly wish
to return to them? <br>
CRUSHER: It's not uncommon. It was identified centuries ago as the
Stockholm syndrome. <br>

JONO: Among my people, a female can never outrank a man. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: By matching DNA gene types, Starfleet was
able to identify the boy as Jeremiah Rossa. <br>
RIKER: Rossa? <br>
PICARD: As in Admiral Rossa? <br>
DATA: She is his grandmother, Captain. He was born fourteen years ago
on the Federation colony, Galen Four. His parents, Connor and Moira
Rossa, were killed three years, nine months later when their colony was
overrun by Talarian forces. <br>
PICARD: I remember. There were no survivors. <br>
DATA: The boy was listed as missing, presumed dead. <br>
RIKER: I heard another Rossa was killed in action at the Krasner
outpost. <br>
PICARD: Tragedy seems to follow that family. The Admiral lost both her
sons. <br>
CRUSHER: And now she'll have something to celebrate. <br>
TROI: Captain, if Jeremiah is returned to his family in his present
condition, it would be a wrenching experience for everyone. Especially
for him. He needs to re-discover his identity, make some connection
with his roots. <br>
PICARD: I agree. Do what you can to accomplish that, Counsellor. <br>
TROI: I don't think I can do anything, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Why not? <br>
CRUSHER: Troi's right. It's very clear that the boy does not respond
well to women. <br>
DATA: The Talarians are a rigidly patriarchical society, sir. <br>
TROI: Jeremiah needs to build a relationship with a man, a father
figure with whom he can explore his origins. And I think it should be
you, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Oh, no, Counsellor! Oh, no, Counsellor, I don't think so. He
needs someone who is trained in these things. <br>
TROI: But you are the only person with whom he has shown any
connection. If he is to find his humanity then you are the only one who
can help him. It's up to you, Captain.

PICARD: Is it not also the custom of your people to listen to the
wishes of their Captain? <br>
JONO: Yes. <br>
PICARD: Then, as Captain of the starship Enterprise, I ask you not to
make that sound. <br>
JONO: Yes, sir. <br>

PICARD: Oh, no, not at all. I thought you'd be comfortable here. <br>
JONO: Are you going to return me to my Captain? <br>

JONO: Pain is not a consideration. <br>

matters. Passing the tests is everything. <br>

particularly comfortable around children. <br>
TROI: Really? <br>
PICARD: For some reason, they just don't seem to respond to me. <br>

PICARD: Frankly, I think my time would be best served carrying out the
duties and responsibilities of a Starfleet Captain. <br>
TROI: Seldom have I heard an explanation so well-rehearsed. <br>
PICARD: Look, Counsellor, I just feel that I'm not the right person for
this job. <br>
TROI: Strange, isn't it? You'll travel light years, dodge asteroid
storms, brave hostile aliens, and yet when asked to assume a parental
role, you cringe. Why do you suppose that is? <br>
PICARD: I'm not cringing. I'm just acknowledging my limitations. <br>
TROI: When you were a child, did you have any friends? Other children
you played with? <br>
PICARD: I don't think that has anything to do with anything. Well,
perhaps it was because. This is foolish. <br>
TROI: What were you going to say? <br>
PICARD: it's just that ever since I was a child I've always known
exactly what I wanted to do. Be a member of Starfleet. Nothing else
mattered to me. Virtually my entire youth was spent in the pursuit of
that goal. In fact, I probably skipped my childhood altogether. <br>
TROI: You know, Captain, almost no one is born being a good parent.
Most people just have to muddle through and do the best that they can. <br>
PICARD: Are you saying that's what I'm going to have to do? <br>
TROI: Yes. And you might be surprised at just how good you can be.

PICARD: Actually, his name is Jeremiah, Jeremiah Rossa. <br>
ENDAR: What is his condition? Is he injured? <br>
PICARD: He was not wounded in the mishap, but as a representative of
the Federation, I require an explanation. Why has this child been held
in your custody for so many years? <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, supplemental. Captain Endar's claim
that Jeremiah Rossa is his son is clearly unacceptable. However, to

repelled the trespassers on Galen Four. I must say your Federation
troops fought tenaciously. <br>
PICARD: Among them Connor and Moira Rossa. <br>
ENDAR: I suppose. After the battle, I found this squalling child
huddled by the body of a young woman, his mother presumably. There was
almost no one left alive on Galen Four. Was I to leave him screaming by
his mother's body? <br>
PICARD: You should have notified the Federation authorities. To conceal
him was a clear violation of our agreement. <br>
ENDAR: I took him in accordance with my peoples' traditions. <br>
PICARD: What tradition is it that empowered you to capture a helpless
child? <br>
ENDAR: I lost my son at the hands of humans during the conflict over
Castal One. Talarian custom allows me to claim the son of a slain
enemy. <br>
PICARD: Does that custom extend also to brutalising this surrogate son?
<br>
ENDAR: What are you talking about? <br>
PICARD: Our medical officer discovered evidence of injuries so severe,
they might be considered torture. <br>
ENDAR: Nonsense. I've never harmed Jono. <br>
PICARD: Then explain the fractured ribs, concussion, the broken arm. <br>
ENDAR: Broken arm? Youth. Have you ever been a father, Picard? Have you
ever had a son desperately try to win your approval, your respect? Jono
broke his ribs riding on a t'stayan. Six hooves. A very powerful beast.
The arm, in a contest with other youths. He endured the pain and won
the competition. One day, he will be a great warrior. <br>
PICARD: Doesn't he deserve to become more than that? His true heritage
is human, Endar. <br>
ENDAR: A heritage long since forgotten. <br>
PICARD: While on board, you are welcome to supervise the return of your
crew, but I cannot allow Jeremiah Rossa to be returned to your custody.
His true family are waiting for him on Earth. <br>
ENDAR: Then under no circumstances will I allow your ship to leave our
territory. <br>
PICARD: I have already reported our position and the nature of this
violation to Starfleet. <br>
ENDAR: And I've already called for reserved forces into the sector. <br>

ENDAR: Would you not for your only son? <br>
PICARD: We have been at peace for many years. Let us not rush headlong
into war. <br>

will be clear to you I have been a good father. He has grown up happy

I've talked with the father, and if I am any judge of character, I
would say that he deeply cares for the boy's welfare. <br>
TROI: I sense awakening memories in the boy. This is a very fragile
time for Jono. If we send away the man he calls father without even
letting them see each other, how will we ever gain his trust? <br>

Talarian territory. A semblance of diplomacy is called for. I'm going

JONO: What is her rank? <br>
PICARD: She is an Admiral. <br>
JONO: She outranks you? <br>
PICARD: Yes. <br>
JONO: If I were home now, I would go to the brae, and run along the
river run as fast as I could! <br>
PICARD: Jono. <br>
JONO: I can't do any of the things that calm me here. You won't let me
have my music, you won't let me make the B'Nar! I feel if I stay still
much longer I will die! <br>
PICARD: Jono, let me show you what I do when I get those feelings. Come
on. </font></p>

these two sections by bouncing the ball and hitting it into that top
centre target. You have to return the ball before it bounces twice.
Alright? Let's try it. <br>

PICARD: Not bad. <br>
JONO: I win at all the games. <br>
PICARD: I can believe it. <br>

clutches his head. He's hearing memories again) <br>
PICARD: Jono? You all right? <br>
JONO: I'm fine. <br>

JEREMIAH [OC]: Momma! <br>
MOIRA [OC]: Jeremiah! <br>
JONO: No! Momma! <br>

melody, just the sound of her voice. Before I remembered these things,
I was strong. And now <br>

hurt, you can also feel joy. <br>

RIKER: How was the racquetball? <br>
PICARD: Oh, he gave me quite a game for his first time out. <br>
JONO: Yes, Captain. I'm looking forward to next time. <br>
PICARD: I'm sure you are. Sit down. What would you like? <br>
JONO: What is that? <br>
WESLEY: This is called a banana split. It's quite possibly one of the
greatest things in the universe. Here, try some. <br>
DATA: That is called a spoon. <br>

all over Wesley) <br>
JONO: Forgive me. <br>
(Everyone is laughing, including Jono) <br>
DATA: I fail to understand why this is amusing. <br>
RIKER: Access your data banks under humour, subheading slapstick. <br>
DATA: Comedy stressing farce and horseplay. Ah. This, no doubt, is a
variation on pie in the face? <br>
RIKER: Now do you see why it's funny? <br>
DATA: No, sir, but I will take your word for it. It is very amusing. <br>
WESLEY: Let's try this again. I'd like a fresh banana split, and
another one for my friend here. <br>
WAITER: Right away. <br>

PICARD: Look at him. He's a different person. <br>

PICARD: Just half an hour ago he was crying like a baby.

Captain Picard and tried to murder him. We're holding him in custody. <br>

this would never have happened. I hold you responsible for this

JONO: What matters is that I have attacked a Captain. I am ready to be
put to death. <br>
PICARD: You think you're going to be killed? <br>
JONO: To attack a superior is the worst offence. I will die at your
hands. <br>

JONO: But I have committed a terrible crime. <br>
PICARD: What I want to know is why? You seemed so happy just a few
hours ago. <br>
JONO: I was. Then I thought about my father. I felt I had betrayed him.
I'd be throwing away all that he's given me, all that I'd learned from
him. My home, running along the river, playing in the games, sharing
victory with my brothers. All the things that are part of my life. As I
grew closer and closer to you, I knew that meant leaving more and more
of that life behind. Forgive me, Captain, but I could not allow myself
to do that.

PICARD: One moment, Captain. Captain Endar, last night Jono attacked me
with a dagger. <br>
ENDAR [on viewscreen]: Which he could not have done had he been
returned to me with the others! <br>
PICARD: There was a crime committed on board this ship, but it was not
Jono's. It was mine. When we found Jono, it seemed so clear what had to
be done. We knew that if only we could persuade him to make the
decision to stay, then you would most likely let him. So with the best
of intentions, we tried to convince him, and in so doing, we thoroughly
failed to listen to his feelings, to his needs. That was the crime, and
it has taken a huge toll on a strong and very noble young man. And it
must be rectified. He will return home. To the only home he's ever
known. And to the father that he loves. To you, Endar. <br>
