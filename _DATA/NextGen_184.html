accident. I haven't missed a single hour of my duties. I volunteered
for extra time in the nursery. My language studies are better than
they've ever been. Somebody else might have given in, but I didn't. <br>
TROI: Given in to what? <br>
BROOKS: Death is a normal part of life. Maybe some of us are better at
facing that than others. <br>
TROI: Maybe some of us aren't facing it at all. <br>
BROOKS: What do you mean? <br>
TROI: Recovery from a great loss involves a great deal of pain. If we
try to avoid that pain, we can make it harder on ourselves in the long
run. <br>
BROOKS: But I feel fine. <br>
TROI: Today would have been your husband's thirty eighth birthday. <br>
BROOKS: You keep excellent records, Deanna. Last night. I dreamt Marc
was with me, celebrating. I was so glad that this nonsense was finally
over. Then I woke up. Alone. And I knew that he was dead. For the first
time, I knew it. I looked around for anything that belonged to him.
Anything. I forgot that after the funeral I told them to take it all
away. What in the world was I thinking? <br>
(Troi gets a wooden box from a cupboard) <br>
TROI: They didn't take everything away. <br>

condition could just reverse itself time. <br>

do to regenerate those cells. In the meantime, I want you to talk to
someone. There are several people on board who have degrees in
psychology, who are qualified therapists. <br>

differently. They walk on eggshells around you. Sometimes they avoid
you altogether. Sometimes they become overbearing, reach out a helping

objects exist entirely in two dimensions, on a single plane. <br>
LAFORGE: They have length and width, but not height. Virtually flat. <br>
DATA: That is why the ship's forward sensors did not detect them
initially. We were looking at them along their edge. There was no
surface to read. I will illustrate. <br>
(the image of Enterprise rotates, and the things are on a line with the
plane of the main saucer) <br>
PICARD: Are they a lifeform? <br>
DATA: The movement pattern within the cluster is not a naturally
occurring phenomenon in the Newtonian sense. They appear to be alive. <br>
RIKER: Can you explain why they're pulling us along with them? <br>
LAFORGE: Somehow, they're able to polarise the graviton field as they
move about. We're caught in the wake. <br>
RIKER: How do we get out of it? <br>
LAFORGE: Best idea for now is to try a controlled overload of the warp
drive. Jump directly to warp six. The laws of a three-dimensional
universe say it should work. Don't know about a two-dimensional
universe though. <br>
PICARD: Fascinating. So many questions. How can a two-dimensional
entity have access to a three-dimensional universe? And are they aware
of us? Number One, if we can put off the T'lli Betans, I would like to
investigate this further as soon as we're free of the graviton field. <br>
LAFORGE: It's a shame we can't tell if they're sentient. <br>
TROI: What do you mean by that? I'm doing the best that I can. <br>
PICARD: No one suggested otherwise, Counsellor. Mister Data, try to
isolate any signal patterns from the cluster. Perhaps there'll be a
basis for communication. Mister La Forge, we'll attempt your warp jump

TROI: No. <br>
GUINAN: Good. I get so tired of people coming in with their problems.
They come in, they want a shoulder to cry on, and generally it turns
out to be mine. <br>
TROI: You'd make a good counsellor. <br>
GUINAN: I think so too. So I'm going to talk to Picard about it. <br>
TROI: About what? You becoming counsellor? <br>
GUINAN: Well, yes, you're leaving. That means there won't be a
counsellor on board, and I suppose I'm going to have a very long line
at that bar. It would be nice to have a nice office, too. <br>
TROI: It's more than just letting them cry on your shoulder. It takes
an enormous commitment. <br>
GUINAN: I can do that. <br>
TROI: Guinan, people come to you to talk about things they want to
reveal. As ship's counsellor, you have to get them to talk about things
they don't want to reveal. <br>
GUINAN: I could do that too. <br>
TROI: What are you? You don't really want to be ship's counsellor. <br>
GUINAN: What would make you say that? <br>
TROI: I just know you're not serious. <br>
GUINAN: Have I given you any indication that I might not serious? <br>
TROI: Not really, but <br>
GUINAN: Then how do you know? Are your empathic abilities coming back? <br>
TROI: No. I suppose it's just instinctive. I get it. You're trying to
make me see that I have other abilities to draw on. Human intuition,
instincts. Guinan, those skills only develop after years of experience.
It's not that easy. <br>
GUINAN: No one said it was easy. It's much harder than you think. Human
intuition and instinct are not always right, but they do make life
interesting. <br>

kilometres long. <br>
ALLENBY: A cosmic string? <br>
RIKER: No wider than a proton but with gravitational fields as powerful
as a black hole. <br>

PICARD: Nevertheless. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, we wouldn't necessarily have to fire at them. Half a

BROOKS: Why? <br>
TROI: I think it was fairly clear during your last appointment. It was
obviously non productive. I couldn't sense what you were feeling. <br>
BROOKS: Deanna, you were right about me. I had to go back and look at
what I was doing, see why I was trying to convince myself and you that
I was a new woman. You made me realise I was doing exactly the same
thing to myself as I was before. Trying to hide from the pain. Maybe
you couldn't sense what I was feeling, but you helped.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Come. <br>
TROI: You wanted to see me, Captain? <br>
PICARD: Yes, Counsellor. Sit down, please. Our situation has become
critical. The cluster remains completely unresponsive. We have not been
able to alter its course toward the cosmic string fragment. <br>
TROI: How much time do we have? <br>
PICARD: Less than five hours. Which is why I have called you. <br>
TROI: Sir? <br>
PICARD: All that remains is the possibility of communication. There
might be some way that we can warn them of their impending destruction.
<br>
TROI: I thought Data had already tried to establish communications
through the universal translator. <br>
PICARD: He has tried every technical means at our disposal to reach
them. <br>
TROI: I wish I knew how to help, Captain, but under the circumstances <br>
PICARD: If there is a psychology to these creatures, we must discover
it. If there is an explanation for their behaviour, we must know what
it is. Even in your current condition, you are the most qualified
person aboard this ship to assist. Data is in Observation attempting to
formulate a strategy. I want you to join him. Deanna, we need you.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TROI: Are your signals reaching them? <br>
DATA: Possibly. However, the beings may perceive them as negligible
noise rather than an attempt at communication. <br>
TROI: Is there any evidence at all that they're sentient? <br>
DATA: Negative. The nature of their movement suggests a simple order of
intelligence. <br>
TROI: I'm sorry, Data. I don't seem to be much help without my empathic
abilities. I just don't know how to draw on my human instinct. <br>
DATA: As I have no human instinct per se, I cannot advise you,
Counsellor. <br>
TROI: Right now, I feel as two-dimensional as our friends out there. In
the universe but barely aware of it. Just trying to survive on
instinct. Data, what if they're simply acting instinctively? There are
inherent, inborn forces in every species. What they need, what they
fear. We have to discover what drives this species. <br>
DATA: I do not believe there is any way we can know for certain,
Counsellor. <br>
TROI: We can speculate on the available evidence. <br>
DATA: The only evidence we have at present is the brief interruption in
their movement pattern during our last attempt to break away. <br>
TROI: Which may suggest some kind of awareness of our presence. <br>
DATA: Otherwise their course and speed have been constant. <br>
TROI: On a straight line to the cosmic string. You're convinced the
string's gravitation is pulling them in? <br>
DATA: Because the cluster is two-dimensional, I do not have enough
direct evidence to support that assumption. However, it is the most
reasonable hypothesis. <br>
TROI: Why? <br>
DATA: It is unlikely they would intentionally move toward a destructive
force. <br>
TROI: Moths fly toward a flame. Horses sometimes run into a burning
barn. Data, don't you see? We've been thinking in three dimensions. We
have to get two-dimensional. <br>
DATA: Pardon me? <br>
TROI: Subspace signals, photon torpedoes, nothing's had an impact. It
is reasonable to wonder if a gravitational pull, even as strong as a
cosmic string's, would affect them. <br>
DATA: Please continue. <br>
TROI: What if they've chosen a course to the cosmic string? A case of
pure stimulus response, driven by instinct, just like the moth to a
flame. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: If Counsellor Troi's supposition is correct,
a replica of the string projected behind the cluster could induce them
to reverse course, disrupting the graviton wake long enough for us to
escape. <br>
PICARD: How do you simulate a cosmic string? It has the gravitational
force of a hundred stars. <br>
DATA: I do not suggest simulating the gravitational field of the string
fragment, rather the string's vibration. <br>
RIKER: Vibration? We're not talking about a violin, Data. <br>
LAFORGE: No, Data's right. The principle is still the same. A cosmic
string emanates a characteristic set of subspace frequencies as atomic
particles decay along its event horizon. I could use the ship's
parabolic dish to amplify and reflect those frequencies back toward the
cluster. The Enterprise itself would echo the cosmic string. <br>
