<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUARK: You know, Morn, there's nothing more
invigorating than breakfast in a bar. Where else can you get raw slug
liver first thing in the morning? <br>
(Rom comes in, sits at the bar, and Quark puts a bowl in front of him.)
<br>
ROM: What's this? <br>
QUARK: What do you mean, what's this? It's puree of beetle. <br>
ROM: I didn't order it. <br>
QUARK: Of course you didn't order it. You don't need to order it. You
have it after work every morning. <br>
ROM: Well, I'm not having it this morning. I'd like two eggs over easy,
three strips of bacon and a side of corned beef hash. <br>
QUARK: What kind of breakfast is that? <br>
ROM: It's Chief O'Brien's breakfast of choice. <br>
QUARK: That's the problem with working alongside humans, you pick up
their disgusting habits. Bacon. Corned beef hash. What's next, Rom?
Orange juice and coffee? <br>
ROM: That might be nice. <br>
QUARK: I don't understand. You gave up a perfectly good job with me to
work on the station's waste extraction system? <br>
ROM: A good waste extraction system is important. Imagine where we'd be
without one. <br>
QUARK: Of course it's important, but my point is, you're not getting
the choice assignments. O'Brien's got you on the night shift, doing all
the work nobody else wants to do. <br>
ROM: I like my work. <br>
QUARK: You like standing all night long, knee-deep in waste, fixing
some broken flow regulator, when you could be here staring at
half-naked dabo girls? <br>
ROM: I have a good job. I'm proud of the work I do. And I know that one
day Chief O'Brien will recognise my efforts and reward me with a
position of respect and responsibility. And why? Because that's just
the way things are in Engineering. <br>
QUARK: I'm sorry I brought it up.

BASHIR: They don't look so fine now. <br>
O'BRIEN: I can't understand it. I been followed Keiko's instructions to
the letter. <br>
BASHIR: They were dry as a bone when I came by for you yesterday. I
mean, I gave them water, I just don't think it wasn't enough. <br>
O'BRIEN: You watered them? These are Idran hybrids. Too much water rots
their roots. <br>
BASHIR: Oh. <br>
(Molly comes in and sees the devastation.) <br>
MOLLY: Mommy's going to be mad. <br>
O'BRIEN: I can't believe it. Keiko's gone for five days and we killed
her plants. <br>
BASHIR: She'll understand, won't she? After all, they're just plants. <br>
O'BRIEN: They're not just plants. These are her bonsai trees. She's
cared for them and nurtured them, and carefully sculpted their growth
for months, years. <br>
MOLLY: You're in trouble. <br>
O'BRIEN: Listen, Molly, I think you and I should both go to the airlock
and welcome Mummy back. And then after we've hugged and kissed, you can
tell her what happened. <br>
MOLLY: Not me. <br>
BASHIR: Well don't look at me. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well you killed her plants. <br>
BASHIR: We killed them. But I think you're overreacting to the
situation. I mean, Keiko will forgive you. It's your birthday today,
isn't it? <br>
O'BRIEN: So far it's one I'd like to forget. <br>
BASHIR: Well, she's been away on Bajor. She's missed you. Bring her a
gift. What kind of chocolates does she like? <br>
O'BRIEN: Tellurian mint truffles. But I still think you should be with
me. <br>
BASHIR: You don't need me there. I've seen you handle your wife
thousands of times. Just say you're sorry and that you take full
responsibility. You'll be fine. Besides, I have to be in surgery,
operating. <br>
O'BRIEN: On who? <br>
BASHIR: I'll find someone.

and closes again.) <br>
O'BRIEN: It was Julian. He was trying to be helpful. He over-watered
them. It's not his fault, but you know how he is. Sometimes he doesn't
even know what he's doing. I'm sorry, sweetheart. We'll buy some new
ones. <br>
KEIKO: Forget it, Miles. They're just plants. <br>
O'BRIEN: Exactly. <br>
KEIKO: It's not as if something happened to Molly or the baby. <br>
O'BRIEN: Right, right, right. Everybody's fine. No problems. <br>
KEIKO: Good. What about Kira? Is she back yet? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, she's still with Shaakar travelling around Dahkur
Province. I thought you were going to visit them. <br>
KEIKO: I didn't get a chance. <br>
O'BRIEN: So, how were the Fire Caves? <br>
KEIKO: Fine. And now it's time for me to tell you some news. I'm not
Keiko. <br>
O'BRIEN: No? Who are you? <br>
KEIKO: Listen carefully, Miles. I have taken possession of your wife's
body. I will hold it hostage until you do everything I tell you do
accurately, and without question. <br>
O'BRIEN: Everything? <br>
KEIKO: If you don't do precisely what I ask, I'll kill your wife. <br>
O'BRIEN: Are you all right? Maybe there's been an outbreak of Rudellian
brain fever on Bajor. We should go see Julian <br>
KEIKO: I see I'm going to have to give you a demonstration of my
sincerity. <br>
(Keiko convulses and collapses.) <br>
O'BRIEN: Keiko! Keiko! (no pulse) No! <br>
(Keiko grabs his hand before he can hit the comm. badge.) <br>
KEIKO: No, Miles, you're not telling anyone. If you do, I'll stop her
heart forever. <br>
O'BRIEN: If you're really in control of my wife's body, let me speak to
her. <br>
KEIKO: She can hear whatever you have to say. <br>
(Keiko has a nosebleed) <br>
O'BRIEN: Not good enough. I want to talk to her. I want her to talk to
me. <br>
KEIKO: You're in no position to bargain, Miles. Strange, these
corporeal bodies of yours. So fragile. Burst even a tiny blood vessel
in the brain and every memory, every passionate emotion, gone forever.
You shouldn't let me eat all of these by myself, Miles. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm not hungry. Look, why don't you just tell me what you want
me to do so we can get this over with. <br>
KEIKO: Very well. <br>
O'BRIEN: But let me make one thing clear I will not do anything to
jeopardise this station or the people on it. <br>
KEIKO: Don't worry, Miles. All I want you to do is reconfigure some of
the communication and sensor relays on the station. <br>
O'BRIEN: Why? <br>
KEIKO: I can't tell you.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: You'll have to be patient. The
communications and sensor relays are distributed throughout the entire
station. <br>
KEIKO: You know your wife well, Miles, but she knows you even better. I
know you're just playing for time until you can get to your friends.
Julian, Dax, Captain Sisko, I know they'll all want to help you. The
Captain may even allow you to do what I'm asking. At least until
someone figures out a way to trap me in some sort of stasis field or
some other clever device you're already dreaming up. And you know what?
It might work. You might be able to stop me. But I promise you one
thing. If you do, Keiko will die. All I need is a split second to cause
a massive brain haemorrhage and she's gone. I know this is a difficult
adjustment for you to make, but we don't have a lot of time. <br>

KEIKO: How long is this going to take? <br>
O'BRIEN: In order to keep the polarity shift invisible to security
checks, I'll have to tap into the optronic integrator on level five. <br>
KEIKO: You're the engineer. What is it, Miles? What do you want to ask
me? You always tighten your brow just a tiny bit
whenever you're about to ask a question. It's something only a wife
would notice. <br>
O'BRIEN: Why Keiko? Why take control of her? Why not me? I'm the one
who can do the work. It'd be more efficient. <br>

KEIKO: Come in. <br>
(Bashir bearing a plant.) <br>
BASHIR: Hope I'm not interrupting anything. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, you are. We're busy. <br>
KEIKO: Miles! Don't be so rude. Ah, Bajoran spiny basil. How
thoughtful. <br>
BASHIR: It's the least I can do after er <br>
KEIKO: It's all right, Julian. I forgive you. Now, you are coming to
the party tonight, aren't you? <br>
BASHIR: I'll be here. I guess it's not a surprise anymore. <br>
KEIKO: I can't believe I did that. I arranged a birthday dinner for you
tonight, but I wanted it to be a surprise. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's okay. I don't like surprises. <br>
BASHIR: Well, I'd better going. I left a patient on the operating
table. I'll see you later. <br>
KEIKO: Thanks, Julian. This was so sweet. <br>
BASHIR: No problem. <br>
(Bashir leaves) <br>
O'BRIEN: A party? Tonight? <br>
KEIKO: It is your birthday. <br>
O'BRIEN: We can't have all those people here. We'll have to cancel. <br>
KEIKO: And raise suspicions? It's better if the dinner goes on as
planned. Besides, Keiko went to a lot of trouble to arrange it for you.
Now, you'd better get back to work. You don't want to be late for your
shift briefing. And I've got a lot of cooking to do. </font></p>

WHATLEY: For a day or two. <br>
TEKOA: (Bajoran woman) What's the matter with Duarte? <br>
WHATLEY: Sick as a vole. <br>
ROM: Is this where Duarte sits? So, what are you drinking? <br>
WHATLEY: Raktajino. <br>
ROM: Great. Is that what we drink on the swing shift? <br>
WHATLEY: You can drink anything you want. <br>
ROM: I'll have a raktajino. It's not like this on the night shift. We
don't drink raktajino. We really don't drink anything. <br>
WHATLEY: Fascinating. <br>
O'BRIEN [on monitor]: Change of plans today, people. I need to
recalibrate the optronic integrator on level five. What is it, Rom? <br>
ROM: I volunteer. I like phase-shifting reconfigurations. <br>
O'BRIEN: Thank you, but I'll take care of that myself. I want the rest
of you to concentrate on the new inertial couplings. I want all sixty
four couplings done today. Whatley, you and Tekoa cover the docking
ring. Abdon and Nori, the cargo bays. Rom the upper pylons. Any
questions? Good. Now, since I'll be working alone today, I'm going to
be very busy. So I don't want to be interrupted by anything
unimportant. Is that clear? <br>

you seen Keiko? <br>

A little fashion crisis. But as usual, your wife has handled
everything. You're a lucky man, Miles. <br>

Everything all right? <br>

for a moment? <br>
SISKO: Of course. <br>
JAKE: Did you see any Pah-wraiths? <br>

JAKE: In the Fire Caves. Odo was telling me the caves were haunted by
some sort of weird supernatural beings. <br>
KEIKO: Don't tell me you believe in wraiths? <br>
ODO: Well, I may have mentioned the Bajoran legends about creatures
living in the caves, but I never said I believe in them. <br>
KEIKO: Well, the only thing I saw in the caves were some beautiful and
botanically fascinating fungi. <br>
JAKE: Well, maybe next time you go to the Fire Caves, I could come
along. I've always wanted to meet a Pah-wraith. <br>
KEIKO: Maybe you will. You never know. <br>

ROM: Culpable deniability. I understand. Don't worry about me, Chief.
My lips are sealed. Nobody will get anything out of me. Not even my
name. <br>
O'BRIEN: Rom, everybody on the station knows your name. <br>

DAX: Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: Commander, what are you doing up at this hour? <br>
DAX: I want you to have a look at something. I couldn't sleep so I got
up and decided to scan the wormhole for radiometric anomalies. <br>
O'BRIEN: At three in the morning? <br>
DAX: I've always found anomalies to be very relaxing. It's a curse. I
was using the wideband filter protocols and when I ran the primary
calibrations check I found this. <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh, they're slightly off spec. <br>
DAX: Yes. I thought it might be a fused matrix inverter until I ran a
level three diagnostic. Have a look. We'd better wake the Captain. We
have a saboteur on the station.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: All right, what have you got? <br>
DAX: Computer, display diagnostic. Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: We've identified nine hundred and forty three tiny
fluctuations in the primary communication relays and several power
distribution junctions. <br>
DAX: Fluctuations that can't be attributed to anything except external
intervention. <br>
SISKO: Someone's gained access to our systems and is altering them. For
what purpose? <br>
O'BRIEN: We're working on that. At this point, it's hard to even call
it sabotage. There's been no real damage. The systems are just a little
off spec. So far, these alterations don't seem to pose any threat to
the station. <br>
SISKO: So far. But this might be just the tip of a very large and
dangerous iceberg. Is there any way to trace how this was done, and by
whom? <br>
ODO: It has to be someone familiar with the station's systems. <br>
DAX: Maybe someone who worked on the station under the Cardassians. <br>
ODO: I'm running extensive security checks on all recent visitors, but
so far, I haven't found anything. <br>
DAX: It could be someone who's been on the station a long time. Someone
with a lot of access. Maybe even someone on the maintenance crew. <br>
SISKO: Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes. <br>
SISKO: Yes, what? Do you think it's someone on your staff? <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: Chief O'Brien, I have a call from your daughter. <br>
SISKO: Go ahead. <br>
O'BRIEN: Molly, honey, what is it? <br>
MOLLY [on monitor]: Hi, Daddy. Mommy told me I could call you. <br>
KEIKO [on monitor]: (brushing Molly's hair) I hope we didn't interrupt
anything important. <br>
O'BRIEN: It's all right, Molly. I'm glad you called. What are you doing
home? <br>
KEIKO [on monitor]: She missed her mommy. Isn't that sweet? <br>
MOLLY [on monitor]: When are you going to come <br>
(The hairbrush tugs.) <br>
MOLLY [on monitor]: Ow! Mommy, that hurt. <br>
KEIKO [on monitor]: Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie. <br>
O'BRIEN: Are you all right, Molly? <br>
KEIKO [on monitor]: She's fine, Miles. She wants to know when you'll be
finished. I told her you had to work another two hours, twenty two
minutes and thirteen seconds. <br>
MOLLY [on monitor]: How long is that, Daddy? <br>
O'BRIEN: Soon. I'll be home very soon. <br>
KEIKO [on monitor]: Good. We both miss you. <br>
(Transmission ends and O'Brien goes back to the main group.) <br>
SISKO: Everything all right? <br>

O'BRIEN: Rom. <br>
ROM: Don't worry, I can hold out until you say otherwise, but there is
one thing I have to know. <br>
O'BRIEN: Go ahead. <br>
ROM: Why are we focusing a chroniton beam at the wormhole? <br>
O'BRIEN: What? <br>
ROM: The new frequency of the deflector grid is set to turn the station
into a massive chroniton array aimed directly at the wormhole. So I
just wanted to know. Why are we trying to kill the wormhole aliens? <br>
O'BRIEN: What are you talking about? A chroniton beam is harmless. <br>
ROM: To us, but its temporal disruption would kill a wormhole alien
instantly. <br>
O'BRIEN: Of course. Why didn't I think of that. She has me so on edge I
haven't been able to see the forest for the trees. <br>
ROM: Who's she? <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't have time to explain now. The question is, why would
anyone want to kill the wormhole aliens? <br>
ROM: Everyone has enemies, even the Prophets. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's right. They're not just wormhole aliens, they're
Prophets, part of Bajoran mythology just like the Pah-wraiths of the
Fire Caves. So, what have those wraiths have to do with the wormhole
aliens? <br>
ROM: Koss'moran. <br>
O'BRIEN: What? <br>
ROM: It's a Bajoran legend. From the verb kosst, meaning 'to be' and
amoran 'banished'. Leeta's been telling me all about Bajoran legends.
She can go on for hours. She says I'm a good listener. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm sure you are. Now's the time to be a good talker. Go on. <br>
ROM: Well, according to Leeta, the Pah-wraiths used to live in the
wormhole. They were part of the Celestial Temple. <br>
O'BRIEN: They were Prophets? <br>
ROM: False Prophets. They were cast out of the Temple, exiled to the
caves where they were imprisoned in crystal fire cages and forbidden to
ever return lest they face the wrath of the true Prophets. <br>
O'BRIEN: So if these false Prophets were to return to the Celestial
Temple? <br>
ROM: I don't think they'd be welcomed. <br>
O'BRIEN: Unless she kills all the wormhole aliens first. Rom, I'm going
to have to leave you in a tough spot. <br>
ROM: Captain Sisko, Odo, they don't know about any of this, do they? <br>
O'BRIEN: No. No, they don't. And I want you to help me keep it that way
for a little while longer. <br>
ROM: I have to stay here and play the idiot? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm afraid so. No matter what Odo asks you <br>

ODO: Ahem. Sorry to disturb you, Chief. A couple of things are still
bothering me. Rom couldn't have done all this sabotage alone. There
were too many changes for any one person to make. <br>
O'BRIEN: Maybe so. Right now I've got a frequency problem in the
cascade feeder. <br>
ODO: I checked with the repair logs. I was hoping to match someone's
movements to the locations where the alterations were made, but I
couldn't do that. <br>

lost. Sorry. <br>
ODO: We've had a lot of system failures recently, haven't we, Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: Really? I hadn't noticed. I've been too busy repairing things.
<br>
ODO: Like the surveillance channels in the holding cells? You
authorised a security override. What was wrong with them? <br>

junction was <br>
