[on viewscreen]: You're a sight for sore eyes, Captain. You, too,
Harry. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry, but do we know you? <br>
BALLARD [on viewscreen]: I'm Ensign Lyndsay Ballard. I was a member of
your crew. Of course, I'm not surprised you don't recognise me. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't know who you are, but I'm not amused. Ensign Ballard
died almost <br>
BALLARD [on viewscreen]: It was on Stardate 51563. I can't blame you
for being sceptical, Captain, but if you let me come aboard, I can
explain everything. <br>
JANEWAY: We'll beam you to Sickbay. <br>
BALLARD [on viewscreen]: I'm sure you'll want me behind a level ten
force field. <br>
JANEWAY: No offence. <br>
BALLARD [on viewscreen]: None taken. I'm just glad to be home. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain? What do you think? <br>
JANEWAY: She seems to have intimate knowledge of this ship and its
crew. I think we should find out who she is. <br>
KIM: Captain, I'd like to come with you. I was very close to Lyndsay,
and if somehow it's her, I'll know. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The EMH scans their visitor then walks through the forcefield.)<br>BALLARD:
Harry and I were on our way to a class M planet in the Vyntadi Expanse
to recover dilithium ore we'd detected a few days earlier. When we
landed, we realised it was a trap set by a Hirogen hunting party.
They'd reconfigured a power cell to give off false dilithium readings. <br>
KIM: That's exactly what happened. <br>
JANEWAY: Go on. <br>
BALLARD: Harry and I headed back to the shuttle. We were ten feet away
when I was hit with a neural disrupter. Harry said my injury wasn't
that bad. He always was a terrible liar. <br>
KIM: I tried to get Lyndsay back to Voyager but she was already dead.
We buried her in space. <br>
JANEWAY: Go on with your story. <br>
BALLARD: I woke up on a ship, in a stasis chamber surrounded by aliens.
They told me they'd used their technology to reanimate me. I didn't
believe them when they said I'd died, but they showed me visual scans
of my own corpse lying in the torpedo casing I'd been buried in. The
Kobali said I'd been drifting for weeks. <br>
JANEWAY: Kobali? <br>
BALLARD: If you ever met them, you'd remember. They look just like
this. After the reanimation process, they spent months altering my DNA.
They were constantly scanning me, injecting me. <br>
KIM: Just to make you look like one of them? <br>
BALLARD: That's how they procreate. They salvage the dead of other
races. I was given a Kobali name and placed with a family to help me
acclimate. <br>
JANEWAY: You were a prisoner. <br>
BALLARD: At first. I wanted to contact you, to tell you I was safe, but
the Kobali wouldn't let me. They said you were part of my kyn'steya,
my, my past life, and that I needed to forget you. All of you. So I
spent two years letting my new family think I'd accepted them. When I
finally earned their trust, I stole a shuttle and started looking for
Voyager. That was six months ago. They've been chasing me ever since. <br>
EMH: In spite of her appearance, I'm detecting traces of human DNA.
I've compared them with the genetic samples from Ensign Ballard's file.
They match. <br>
JANEWAY: It's certainly a convincing story. <br>
BALLARD: But your Starfleet training is telling you to consider all the
possibilities. Maybe I'm some sort of hybrid clone, or telepath who
accessed Ensign Ballard's memory somehow? Believe me, I was suspicious
myself at first, but I am Lyndsay Ballard. <br>
JANEWAY: Until we find evidence to the contrary, welcome home. <br>(Janeway lowers the forcefield and shakes Ballard's hand.)<br>
KIM: Captain, could you give us a minute? <br>
JANEWAY: Doctor. <br>(Janeway and the EMH go into his office.)<br>
KIM: So it's really you?<br>
BALLARD: In the flesh, so to speak.<br>(Kim hugs her.)<br>BALLARD: I've missed you, too. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Briefing

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
I know you're all as eager as I am to welcome Ensign Ballard back.
She's a fine officer, who's shown a lot of courage and determination
over the past few years. And we're lucky to have her with us again. Let's do everything we can
to make her feel at home. <br>
NEELIX: Tom and I have already taken the liberty of removing Lyndsay's personal
effects from storage. <br>
TORRES: And whenever you're ready, your old shift is waiting for you in
Engineering. <br>
BALLARD: Thanks, Lieutenant. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Before we get ahead of ourselves, let's not forget the Kobali
are still out there. <br>
JANEWAY: It seems they want her back as much as we want to keep her.
We'll need to take precautions in case they track her to Voyager. <br>
TUVOK: I've run preliminary scans on the Kobali shuttle. I believe I
can adapt our systems to counter a possible attack. <br>
JANEWAY: Very good. Well, if there's no further business. <br>(The meeting breaks up.)<br>

BALLARD: Oh? What'd you say? Come on, it's everyone's fantasy to hear
their own eulogy. <br>
KIM: Absolutely not. <br>
BALLARD: It's probably for the best. You always were a terrible public
speaker. I just hope you didn't stutter too much. <br>
KIM: I told them you had a favourite saying. Something you got from an
old Klingon battle cry? <br>
BALLARD: Own the day. <br>
KIM: I said that you always believed in attacking each day, possessing
it, and that that was what made you so much fun to be around. <br>
BALLARD: Is that when everybody burst into tears? <br>
KIM: I said that if you'd been there, you would have told them to own
that day. To attack it, make it their own, and plan to do the same
thing tomorrow. <br>
BALLARD: Pretty strong stuff. <br>
KIM: You were a strong person. <br>
BALLARD: Not always. These last six months haven't been easy. There
were plenty of times when I could have given up. <br>

won't be needing this anymore. <br>(She holds up her hairbrush) <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: My
scans identified a genetic pathogen in your bloodstream. It appears to
have converted most of your human DNA into a Kobali protein structure. <br>
KIM: Is there any way to reverse it? <br>
EMH: The biochemical changes have affected every system in your body.
I'm afraid there isn't enough of your original DNA left to make you
human again. But I believe I can affect some cosmetic changes. <br>
BALLARD: Are you saying you could make me look like me again? <br>
EMH: Yes. The alternations would literally be skin-deep, and it may
take several treatments, but I've devised an inaprovaline compound
which should do the trick. Physiologically, you'd still be Kobali with
a multispheric brain, a binary cardiovascular system. <br>
BALLARD: But I'd look human? <br>
EMH: Oh, yes. <br>
BALLARD: I've lived with this face for long enough. Let's do it. <br>
EMH: Have a seat. You may experience some dizziness. <br>

SEVEN: Commander. I no longer wish to serve as guardian to the Borg
children. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What's the problem? <br>
SEVEN: Their behaviour is chaotic. My attempts to apply discipline only
result in further disorder. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Well, kids and disorder usually go hand in hand. <br>
SEVEN: Neelix issued a similar warning prior to my taking this
assignment, which is why I devised an activities schedule to promote
focus and unity. Oh seven hundred hours, the children emerge from their
alcoves. Nutrients are ingested in the mess hall prior to proceeding to
the science lab to begin classes. At thirteen hundred hours nutrients
are consumed a second time, before reporting to the holodeck, where
they're studying comparative alien physiology. <br>

SEVEN: On the contrary, I've scheduled recreational activities. <br>(She has the schedule on the screen. 1500-1600 hours. Fun.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: You can't always schedule fun, Seven. Sometimes it needs to
be spontaneous. <br>
SEVEN: According to my research, children require structure. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I agree, but not to this extreme. You're treating them like
they're still on a Borg Cube. <br>
SEVEN: You're comparing me to the Collective? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You have all four children functioning as one. They do the
same things together at the same time. <br>
SEVEN: So that each child has the same opportunities to learn. <br>
CHAKOTAY: They're individuals. Maybe they're rebelling because you
don't let them express themselves. <br>

BALLARD: No, I wasn't. Dilithium extraction was always Lieutenant
Torres' specialty. And Tuvok had far more experience conducting away

brought you death, for they gave you the chance to live again. In
letting me die, Captain, you gave me life. I'm sorry. <br>
JANEWAY: Lyndsay. <br>
BALLARD: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come.

You're late. <br>
EMH: We expected you hours ago. <br>
BALLARD: For what? <br>
NEELIX: Your farewell party. <br>
TORRES: You weren't supposed to come back. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You don't belong here anymore. <br>
BALLARD: Harry, what's going on? <br>
KIM: Lyndsay Ballard, beloved friend and crewman. Does that sound
right? <br>
BALLARD: What? <br>
KIM: For your eulogy. Does that sound okay? <br>
BALLARD: Harry, I'm not dead. <br>
EMH: Denial. One of the final stages. <br>
TUVOK: It was illogical for you to return. <br>
BALLARD: Please, I don't want to go. <br>
KIM: I couldn't save you before, Lyndsay. What makes you think I can
save you now? <br>(There is Kobali male there.)<br>

Come in. (Ballard walks straight in and sits on the side of his bed.)<br>KIM: What's wrong? <br>
BALLARD: Bad day, I guess. <br>
KIM: B'Elanna told me you did great in Engineering. <br>
BALLARD: I solved a simple problem. <br>
KIM: Didn't sound so simple to me. <br>
BALLARD: Any Kobali can discern simple wave distortions. And even if
B'Elanna was impressed, the others were staring at me. <br>
KIM: I'm sure it was just your imagination. <br>
BALLARD: And then, to make matters worse, I started babbling in front
of the Captain. <br>
KIM: I used to get pretty nervous around her, too. Don't worry. I'm
sure she didn't take it personally. Hey. I know this isn't easy, but
I'll help you through this. <br>
BALLARD: You have always been far too nice to me. Why is that? <br>
KIM: You really don't have any idea, do you? Think about it. I
rearranged my schedule at the Academy just so we'd be in the same
classes. I let you teach me how to skate even though I hate the cold.
I'm crazy about you. I have been since the day we met. <br>
BALLARD: Why didn't you ever tell me? <br>
KIM: I was never good at public speaking, remember, but I figure, how
often do you get a second chance? Which is why I'd very much like to
kiss you now. <br>
BALLARD: Own the day.

Q'RET: You were so beautiful. It's good to see you, Jhet'leya. <br>
BALLARD: My name is Lyndsay. <br>
Q'RET: Why did you leave us? <br>
BALLARD: I wanted to be with my people again. <br>
Q'RET: These people? The same ones who set you adrift in space? <br>
JANEWAY: We jettisoned her body in accordance with our customs. <br>
Q'RET: You abandoned her. <br>
KIM: You had no right to tamper with her remains. <br>
Q'RET: We were acting in accordance with our customs. <br>
KIM: You mutilated her. <br>
TUVOK: Ensign. <br>
Q'RET: The reanimation process usually results in extensive memory
loss, which makes the transition less painful. Unfortunately, some
remember their former lives more than others. Jhet'leya, for example. <br>
BALLARD: I told you to call me <br>
Q'RET: Lyndsay Ballard. She's dead. She has been for three years.
Forgive me for being so blunt, but when we found her she was a
lifeless corpse. We salvaged that raw material to create a new person,
my daughter, whom I love. <br>BALLARD: I'm not your daughter. <br>
Q'RET: You may have altered your appearance, but do you still think like
these people? Even now, the first words that come into your head, are
they in their language or mine? I realise this place is familiar to you,
but it's not where you belong. Your sister misses you. <br>
BALLARD: Tynsia. <br>
Q'RET: She keeps asking when you're coming home. What should I tell
her? <br>

Midnight snack? <br>
BALLARD: Kobali cuisine at its finest. <br>
KIM: So I was giving some thought to number thirty two, make Tuvok
laugh? He has this holoprogramme, The Temple of T'Panit. I thought we might tweak it so that
instead of Vulcan prayers, the monks recite Ferengi limericks? You're
not laughing. <br>
BALLARD: Sorry. I can't stop thinking about Q'Ret. <br>
KIM: I can't believe he had the nerve to call himself your father. I'll
bet Professor Ballard would have had something to say about that. <br>
BALLARD: Who? <br>
KIM: Your dad. Doesn't he teach at some university? <br>
BALLARD: I don't remember. I don't remember anything about him. <br>

BALLARD: You said you could maintain my appearance. <br>
EMH: I can, but it looks like I'll need to increase the frequency of
your treatments. You'll have to see me at least twice a day. <br>

How am I supposed to do anything? <br>

don't care if you're human, Kobali or Bolian, I just want you to be
happy. <br>
BALLARD: I wouldn't fit in. <br>
KIM: Are you saying Tuvok and Neelix don't fit in? <br>

They know where they come from, who they are. <br>
KIM: Wherever they come from, they're part of this crew now. Just like
you. <br>

won't be Lyndsay anymore. <br>
KIM: You don't honestly believe that. <br>
BALLARD: Since the day I got back here, I haven't felt right. At first I
thought it was Voyager. Things had changed so much, I thought if I just
gave myself more time I'd get used to it. But it's me. I've changed.
And the more I try to deny it, the more I feel like a ghost. I'm sorry,
