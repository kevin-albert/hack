Odo is with Quark at the bar.) <br>
QUARK: Have you ever seen anything so disgusting? The way he's
undressing her with his eyes. And look at his hands. <br>
ODO: What about his hands? <br>
QUARK: His gestures. They're obscene. You should arrest him. <br>
ODO: You're joking. <br>
QUARK: He's pitiful. Doesn't he realise she loves me? <br>
ODO: I don't think he does. To be honest, I don't think she does
either. <br>
QUARK: Thanks for your support. <br>
ROM: Brother! I just talked to Moogie. She says Grand Nagus Zek has
disappeared. <br>
QUARK: What do you mean, disappeared? <br>
ROM: He left her a note saying he was going on a business safari to
open new territories for financial exploitation. <br>
QUARK: That's our Nagus. <br>
ROM: He said he'd be back in five days. That was twelve days ago! <br>
QUARK: Twelve? <br>
ODO: Has he done this before? <br>
ROM: Not for this long. Moogie did some checking. No one's heard from
him. He could be hurt or even dead. We have to do something! <br>
QUARK: He probably stopped off on Risa. You know, for a little rest and
relaxation. <br>
ROM: Risa? With all those gorgeous women? He wouldn't do that to
Moogie. <br>
QUARK: Have you looked at our mother lately? She's not getting any
younger. Now do us both a favour and stop worrying about Zek. He'll
show up. <br>
ROM: Are you sure? <br>
QUARK: Goodbye, Rom. Goodbye. Where'd Ezri go? <br>
ODO: Oh, she slipped out the back with Bashir. <br>
QUARK: They left together? <br>
ODO: I think they were holding hands. <br>
QUARK: Oh.

QUARK: Blessed Exchequer, whose greed is eternal. Allow this humble
bribe to open your ears and hear this plea from your most devout
debtor. Continue to bless my bar with a steady stream of thirsty
customers whose pockets are lined with latinum, and whose skills at
dabo are shaky at best. And while you're at it, see if you can do
something about Doctor Bashir. Don't hurt him or anything, just get him
off the station for a couple of months. Oh, and one other thing. I
opened negotiations with Ezri three months ago, but I can't seem to
close the deal. Anything you can do to help <br>
(The doorbell rings three times.) <br>
QUARK: Come in. Ezri. <br>
(The black leather clad woman twists Quark's arm up behind his back.) <br>
EZRI: Anyone else here? <br>
QUARK: Just you and me. <br>
EZRI: Is that the bedroom? <br>
QUARK: I owe you. Does it have to be so rough the first time? <br>
EZRI: I don't know what you think is going on here, but think again. <br>
QUARK: Don't tell me. This is some new kind of therapy? Am I suppose to
start talking about my childhood or something? <br>
EZRI: I hope not. <br>
QUARK: Good, because I'd rather talk about us. Dax, Dax, you're the
most fascinating woman I've ever met. I love you. There. I said it! <br>
EZRI: My name's not Dax. <br>
QUARK: Oh, I get it. Your clothes, the knife, this aggressive attitude.
It's all role playing. Call me Shmun. <br>
EZRI: Shmun? <br>
QUARK: Yeah. And I'll call you T'lana. You know, from 'Vulcan Love
Slave' Volume Three. <br>
(She lets him go.) <br>
EZRI: You're a very confused man, aren't you? If your friend Zek is
depending on you, he's in a lot more trouble than he thinks. <br>
QUARK: Zek? What does he have to do with any of this? <br>
EZRI: I'll let him explain. <br>
ZEK [on monitor]: Hello, Quark. It's me, your Grand Nagus. You'll never
guess where I am. <br>
QUARK: Risa? <br>
ZEK [on monitor]: If you said Risa, guess again. I'm in the alternate
universe! <br>
QUARK: You're not my Dax. You're from over there. <br>
EZRI: You're catching on. <br>
ZEK [on monitor]: You're probably wondering how I got here well, you're
going to have to keep on wondering, because I don't have time to tell
you. You see, I'm in a bit of trouble. I'm being held prisoner by the
Alliance and I'm going to need you to help me regain my freedom. The
Regent said he would send me home in exchange for a ship's cloaking
device. They don't have them in this universe. I wish I'd known that
before I got here. I could've saved myself a lot of aggravation and
made a nice profit at the same time. However, my fate is in your hands,
Quark. I need a cloaking device and I need it now. You're the only one
I can count on. If you do this for me I promise I'll be eternally
grateful. And don't forget to tell your mother I love her. Goodbye. <br>
QUARK: He should've gone to Risa. <br>
EZRI: The Regent wants the cloaking device in three days. <br>
QUARK: That's not much time. Cloaking technology isn't that easy to
come by. <br>
EZRI: You'll find a way. <br>
QUARK: And if I don't? <br>
EZRI: The Nagus will die.

QUARK: Not that I can see. <br>
ROM [OC]: Then let's do it. <br>
QUARK [OC]: All right, together now. Now lift! <br>
ROM [OC]: It's heavy. <br>
QUARK [OC]: Oh, I noticed. <br>
(Rom then Quark come out carrying a heavy invisible object between
them.) <br>
QUARK: Watch the steps. <br>
ROM: I see them, brother. I told you cloaking the cloaking device was a
good idea. <br>
QUARK: Brilliant. But couldn't you have done something about its
weight? <br>
ROM: No. But if it makes you feel any better, the cloaking device on
the Defiant is a lot heavier. <br>
QUARK: Tell it to my hernia. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROM: You know what's bothering me? It seems wrong
to be stealing a cloaking device for the Alliance. <br>
QUARK: We're not stealing it for them, we're stealing it to save Zek. <br>
ROM: But what about this other Ezri? She's a Trill. <br>
QUARK: So? <br>
ROM: So, shouldn't she be with the rebels fighting against the
Alliance? <br>
QUARK: Be sure to point that out when you meet her. Just don't forget,
she carries a knife. Shh. Someone's coming. Set it down, quick. <br>
(Thud onto Quark's toe.) <br>
QUARK: Act normal. <br>
MARTOK: I'm telling you, Captain, we have to find a way to expand our
lines beyond the Kalandra system. <br>
SISKO: I agree. If we don't move soon, the ionic storms will isolate
our position. <br>
MARTOK: And allow the Dominion to flank us. <br>
SISKO: Something wrong, gentlemen? <br>
QUARK: It's the bulkhead. <br>
MARTOK: What about it? <br>
QUARK: Rom's thinking of painting his quarters this colour. <br>
SISKO: They're already that colour. <br>
QUARK: I told you! <br>
ROM: No wonder I like it. It's a very soothing shade of grey. <br>
SISKO: I'm glad you approve. <br>
MARTOK: Captain. <br>
SISKO: Hmm? Carry on. <br>
(Martok and Sisko leave.) <br>
SISKO [OC]: I'll talk to Admiral Ross. <br>
MARTOK [OC]: I'll talk to Chancellor Gowron as well. <br>
ROM: They're headed for the Klingon ship. What if they discover the
cloaking device is missing? <br>
QUARK: Let's get out of here. Where is it? <br>
ROM: I'm not sure. <br>
QUARK: Well, find it. <br>
(Zap and fritz!) <br>

were you. <br>

QUARK: One Klingon cloaking device, as requested. <br>
EZRI: As soon as I bring that to the Regent, he'll release Zek. <br>
QUARK: Then what happens? <br>
EZRI: Then you get him back. Would you stop doing that? <br>
ROM: Doing what? <br>
EZRI: Staring at me. <br>
ROM: Sorry. But you look just like our Ezri, except you're a lot
taller. <br>
QUARK: What are you talking about? She's exactly the same height. <br>
ROM: I don't think so <br>
QUARK: Don't be an idiot. I'm telling you they're identical, I think. <br>
EZRI: Do I have to throw you off this transport pad? <br>
ROM: One thing's for sure, their personalities aren't identical. How do
we know the Regent will keep his word and send Zek back to us? <br>
EZRI: You don't. But there's not much you can do about it, is there? <br>
ROM: Yes, there is. Brother, I think we should go with her. <br>
EZRI: I don't think you'll like it too much on the other side. <br>
QUARK: That, I believe. But my idiot brother is right. We're coming
with you. <br>

ROM: It looks like Deep Space Nine to me. <br>
QUARK: I suppose a cargo bay is a cargo bay, no matter what universe
you're in. <br>
ROM: But this is an alternate universe. Shouldn't everything be
different? <br>
QUARK: It's different enough. Remember what Captain Sisko once told us?
In this universe, we're both dead. <br>

EZRI: We'd better get moving. I've got a ship waiting for us at landing

yours is now the property of the Terran Resistance Forces. <br>
ROM: But you don't understand. You have to give us back the cloaking
device. We need it to rescue the Nagus. <br>
BASHIR: That's not who you should be worried about right now. Do you
know what we do to Alliance sympathisers? <br>
O'BRIEN: Give it a rest, Julian. <br>
BASHIR: I'll give it a rest just as soon as these three get what's
coming to them. <br>
ROM: I don't know about you, but I like our Bashir better. <br>
O'BRIEN: You have to forgive him. He's had a rough go of it lately. He
lost a close friend in a skirmish with Alliance troops. <br>
BASHIR: This has nothing to do with Jadzia. Do you know what would
happen to us if the Alliance got hold of a cloaking device? <br>
O'BRIEN: It wouldn't be pretty. <br>
BASHIR: They'd wipe us out in a matter of weeks. Besides, there's
nothing I loathe more than traitors. <br>
EZRI: I'm not a traitor. <br>
O'BRIEN: She's right. You have to believe in something before you can
betray it. <br>
EZRI: I believe in getting paid for my work, and you still owe me for
the last job I did for you. <br>
O'BRIEN: We're fighting for our freedom here, for our very lives. All
you care about is money? <br>
EZRI: Like you said, you have to have something to believe in. <br>
BASHIR: Let me ram those words down her throat. <br>
O'BRIEN: You're forgetting something, Julian. The Alliance didn't get
the cloaking device, we did. And that gives us the edge. And we have
these gentlemen to thank for it. <br>
BASHIR: So what do you want to do? Give them medals? <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't think their Captain Sisko would be too pleased to know
they were over here interfering in our affairs. <br>
ROM: That's why we didn't tell him. <br>
O'BRIEN: I thought as much. I say we send them back to where they
belong. Let Sisko deal with them. <br>
QUARK: We can't go back. Not without Zek. <br>
O'BRIEN: The way I see it, you've got two choices. You can either head
back to where you came from or you can head for Alliance territory and
try to rescue your friend without the cloaking device. You have till
morning to decide. <br>
BASHIR: Either way, you're staying with us. <br>
(O'Brien and Bashir leave.) <br>
ROM: Tough break. <br>
EZRI: I'll live. <br>
QUARK: You sure? <br>
EZRI: Don't worry about me. Smiley's right about one thing. If you're
found in Alliance territory without the cloaking device, you're dead. <br>

ROM: Maybe in our universe he'd do something like that, but not over
here. Over here, everything's alternate. So he's a nice guy. Which
means the tube grubs here should be poisonous, because they're not
poisonous on our side. But if Brunt gave us poisonous tube grubs it
would mean he wasn't as nice as we think he is. But he has to be nice

never would have been able to get to this universe. Remember the last

if we let them live, they may come in handy. <br>

I don't much like for you either. <br>
