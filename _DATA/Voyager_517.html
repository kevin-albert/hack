CHAKOTAY: I thought we were trying to disable it. <br>
SEVEN: The torpedo detonated near the power matrix. It caused a chain
reaction. <br>
JANEWAY: Survivors?. <br>
TUVOK: None. <br>
JANEWAY: Debris status. <br>
KIM: There's a few components intact, but they're badly damaged. <br>
JANEWAY: Begin a salvage operation. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: There might be something we can use. Weapons, a transwarp coil.
I don't know about the rest of you, but I feel lucky today. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Cargo
Bay two]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The savage operation has yielded lots of pieces.)<br>JANEWAY: Now, this is how I prefer the Borg. In pieces. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Eight kilotons of debris, most of it hull fragments. So far
we've recovered two power nodes and a dozen plasma conduits, all in
working order. <br>
JANEWAY: Their propulsion system, anything left? <br>
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna found a transwarp coil. <br>(Janeway picks up a metal sphere.)<br>
JANEWAY: It's lighter than I expected. It must be some kind of
polytrinic alloy. Let's hope our little skirmish got back to the hive
mind. Maybe they'll think twice before they attack us again. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It was only a probe. Next time, we might not be so lucky. <br>
KIM: Captain, don't touch that. <br>
JANEWAY: What is it? <br>
KIM: I don't know, but a few minutes ago it was crawling around the
floor. I think it's some kind of auto-regeneration unit. <br>
JANEWAY: Thanks for the warning. By my count, we've added at least two
years to our journey by avoiding the Borg. I'm tired of turning tail
every time we detect a Cube. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Better safe than assimilated, <br>
JANEWAY: Mmm. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe I should go to red alert and get it over with. <br>
JANEWAY: Commander? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You're about to drop one of your bombshells. <br>
JANEWAY: Now what makes you say that? &nbsp;<br>
CHAKOTAY: The way you fiddle with your com. badge. You do it every time. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, I'll have to keep an eye on that. <br>
EMH: Eureka! I was hoping to find one of these. It's a servo-armature
from a medical repair drone. Laser scalpel, biomolecular scanner,
micro-suture, all rolled into one instrument. <br>
PARIS: No Federation Sickbay should be without one. <br>
EMH: This could revolutionise the way that I perform surgery. <br>
JANEWAY: Excellent. Why don't you deactivate it for now? <br>
TORRES: Remodulate the coil frequency. <br>
SEVEN: No effect. <br>
TORRES: Try again. <br>
SEVEN: The field regulator is fused. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What seems to be the problem? <br>
TORRES: We can't activate the transwarp coil. <br>
SEVEN: When a Borg vessel is critically damaged, all of its vital
technology self-destructs. The coil is beyond repair. <br>
CHAKOTAY: At least the Doctor found a new toy. <br>
SEVEN: Captain. Datanodes. One of them is a drone manifest, the other
contains tactical information. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Specifically? <br>
SEVEN: Long range sensor telemetry, assimilation logistics and vessel
movements for a radius of thirty light years. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, let's take a look. <br>
SEVEN: I'll need to convert the information to Starfleet parameters. <br>
JANEWAY: Time? <br>
SEVEN: Two hours. <br>
JANEWAY: Do it. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PARIS:
After nine hours staring at that debris, I was beginning to feel like a
drone. <br>
KIM: I could use a shower. <br>
PARIS: Do Borg shower? Neelix, we need a couple of beers. <br>
NEELIX: Name your malt. <br>
PARIS: Ktarian. Replicate a pint for yourself, because we're going to
toast the man of the hour. <br>
NEELIX: Oh? <br>
PARIS: It was Harry's idea to beam over a photon torpedo while they
were remodulating their shields. <br>
KIM: I didn't think they'd fall for it. <br>
PARIS: Ah, but they did. Hook, line and sinker. Oh, I would have loved to
have seen the look on their faces. Boom! <br>
KIM: To be honest, I wish the boom had been a bit smaller. We were only
trying to disable them. <br>(Seven enters.)<br>
PARIS: They were drones, Harry. Mindless automatons. We did them a
favour. <br>
KIM: Seven. <br>
PARIS: Look, I didn't mean anything by that. <br>
SEVEN: Your apology is irrelevant. It is impossible to offend a
mindless drone.<br>(Neelix delivers the beers, which have massive foam heads on them.) <br>
PARIS: Cheers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> SEVEN:
I was able to recover sixty two percent of the data. This is an isogrid
of Borg tactical movements across twenty five sectors. <br>
JANEWAY: Are there any dangers along our present course? <br>
SEVEN: There are three Cubes approximately nine light years away,
travelling on a trajectory parallel to our own. They do not pose a
threat. <br>
JANEWAY: What about that vessel? <br>
SEVEN: It's a scout ship, eight light years away, travelling at warp
two. The ship is heavily damaged. <br>
TUVOK: Was it attacked? <br>
SEVEN: No. An ion storm. The Sphere is presently regenerating. That
explains why it is travelling at low warp. <br>
JANEWAY: Limping home. <br>
SEVEN: In a manner of speaking. <br>
JANEWAY: I want a detailed schematic of this vessel, down to the power
distribution nodes. I think we've just struck gold. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Briefing
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: So what we have here in two simple words is, Fort Knox. <br>
TUVOK: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: Tom, translate? <br>
PARIS: Fort Knox. The largest repository of gold bullion in Earth's
history. Over fifty metric tons worth over nine trillion U.S. dollars. <br>
JANEWAY: Keep going. <br>
PARIS: Well, er, when the new world economy took shape in the late
twenty second century and money went the way of the dinosaur, Fort Knox
was turned into a museum. <br>
JANEWAY: And no one ever managed to break into that facility, right? <br>
PARIS: Well, a couple of Ferengi tried about ten years ago, but other
than that, it's considered impenetrable. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Are you planning a heist? <br>
JANEWAY: As a matter of fact. Except we're not chasing gold. We're
going to steal a transwarp coil. Think it might come in handy? <br>
TORRES: If I could equip our engines with even one coil, we could shave
about twenty years off this trip. <br>
TUVOK: Do you believe the Borg sphere is damaged enough for us to
penetrate its defences? <br>
JANEWAY: Long enough to take what we want and get out in one piece. but
we'd have to plan this operation down to the millisecond. There would
be no margin for error. As I see it, we plan an intercept course that
won't attract their attention, then create a diversion to keep them
occupied so we can send in an away team to obtain the technology. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'd like to see the data on that Sphere. We might be able to
recreate parts of it on the holodeck, run a few tactical simulations. <br>
JANEWAY: It's all yours. <br>
TORRES: We need to mask our warp signature. I've got a few Maquis
tricks up my sleeve. They're not exactly Starfleet approved, but. <br>
JANEWAY: This is no time for protocol. Get started. The sphere is three
days away by maximum warp. Set a course. Chakotay, I want an outline
for our heist by tomorrow morning. We've proven ourselves against the
Borg once before, twice before, but we're always the ones under attack.
I think it's time to do a little assimilating of our own, hmm?
Dismissed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: I was hoping you'd be a little more vocal. Any thoughts? <br>
SEVEN: Your plan is ambitious. There are many variables. But it can
succeed. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd like to narrow that list of variables. I was hoping your
parents might provide us with a few insights. I've been looking over
the records we found on the U.S.S. Raven. Your parents kept extensive
field notes, detailed journals. There are over nine thousand log
entries alone. <br>
SEVEN: The information is irrelevant. <br>
JANEWAY: On the contrary, Seven. They spent their careers studying the
Borg. They tracked a cube at close range for what, two years? <br>
SEVEN: Three. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, I'd say that made them experts. I want you to study
their research. Look for any data that might give us a tactical edge. <br>
SEVEN: My parents were assimilated. Obviously their tactics were
flawed. <br>
JANEWAY: Look, these records have been collecting dust in our database
for over a year. You say they're irrelevant, and I say you've been
avoiding them. You're the best person for the job, but I'll assign it
to Chakotay if I <br>
SEVEN: No. The information belongs to me. I will read it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Cargo
Bay two]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Neelix brings in a case of PADDs.)<br>SEVEN:
You're late. <br>
NEELIX: Sorry. It took longer than I expected to download these
records. This is only the first batch. Your parents sure had a lot to
say. I organised the information by category. Field notes, personal
logs, biokinetic analyses. I don't mean to pry, but is it true your
parents were studying the Borg? <br>
SEVEN: Yes. The Hansens were exobiologists. <br>
NEELIX: Fascinating. They must have been very courageous. <br>
SEVEN: They were misguided. <br>
NEELIX: A faded holo-image. That's all I've got left of my family. A
picture of my sister. Except, of course, what I keep in here. (his heart) What I
wouldn't give for a treasure trove like this. Well, I'd better get
started on the rest of those files. <br>(Neelix leaves. Seven takes the first PADD.)<br>
MAGNUS [OC]: Field notes, U.S.S. Raven, Stardate 32611.4. It's about
time. The Federation Council on Exobiology has given us final approval.
Starfleet's still concerned about security issues but they've agreed
not to stand in our way. We've said our goodbyes, and we're ready to
start chasing our theories about the Borg. </font></p>

MAGNUS: Ah, ah, ah, put down the cube, Muffin. It's not a toy. <br>
ANNIKA: I won't crash it. <br>
MAGNUS: Come here, Daddy wants to talk to you. Now, remember when I
said that you, me and Mommy were going on a very long voyage? <br>
ANNIKA: Ah ha. <br>
MAGNUS: Well, we're leaving tomorrow and we won't see Earth for quite a
while. <br>
ANNIKA: Are we going to see the Borg? <br>
MAGNUS: If we're lucky. <br>
ANNIKA: Do the Borg have kids, too? <br>
MAGNUS: Nobody knows. We'll be the first humans to study them up close.
<br>
ANNIKA: What do they look like? <br>
MAGNUS: We're not sure exactly, but we think they might look a lot like
us, but with technology inside their bodies. <br>
ANNIKA: Cy-ber-netic? <br>MAGNUS: Mmm hmm.<br>ANNIKA: Are they friendly? <br>
MAGNUS: Well, they're different. They don't talk like us, or even think
like us, but we're hoping to make friends one day. <br>
ANNIKA: I hope so, too, Daddy. </font></p>

[OC]: Field notes, U.S.S. Raven, Stardate 32623.5: we've been tracking

run environmental systems at half power, we can go another twenty light
years before refuelling. <br>
ERIN: We should refuel now. The nearest dilithium is in an asteroid
field just ten days from here. <br>
MAGNUS: That's ten days we can't afford to lose. We're getting close.
If we stop now, we might as well just turn around and go home. <br>
ERIN: Home, to what? We have deviated from our flight plan, crossed the
Neutral Zone, disobeyed a direct order to return. Our colleagues
obviously think we are insane. We have burned our bridges, Magnus. <br>(Annika enters.)<br>
ANNIKA: I can't sleep. <br>
MAGNUS: Come here. Why can't Annika sleep? The greatest scientific
mystery of our time. <br>

ERIN: Power utilisation curve is highly symmetric.<br>
MAGNUS: Artificial source probability point nine eight. (to Annika) Now. It's got
to be a transwarp conduit. Nothing else could generate these readings.
I'm taking us closer. <br>
ERIN: It's a Borg Cube, two thousand kilometres starboard. <br>
MAGNUS: I've got a visual. <br>
ERIN: It's massive. Twenty eight cubic kilometres, hundred and twenty
nine thousand lifeforms on board. We're being scanned. They haven't
altered course. <br>
MAGNUS: This could prove our theory. They ignore any lifeform until
they consider it a threat, or a target. They're moving off. <br>

Congratulations. <br>
SEVEN: Regarding? <br>
QUEEN: Assimilation is complete. <br>
SEVEN: Three hundred thousand individuals have been transformed into
drones. Should they be congratulated as well? <br>
QUEEN: They should be. They've left behind their trivial, selfish lives
and they've been reborn with a greater purpose. We've delivered them
from chaos into order. <br>
SEVEN: Comforting words. Use them next time instead of resistance is
futile. You may elicit a few volunteers. <br>
QUEEN: You cling to sarcasm because you are afraid to see the truth.
Species one zero zero two six is already adding to our perfection. You
can feel their distinctiveness coursing through us, enhancing us. Stop
resisting. Take pleasure in this. <br>
SEVEN: I will not take pleasure in the destruction of a race. <br>
QUEEN: Human sentiment. Compassion, guilt, empathy. They're irrelevant.
<br>
SEVEN: Not to me. <br>
QUEEN: Me? There is no me. There is only us. One mind. <br>
SEVEN: My thoughts are my own. <br>
QUEEN: We've overlooked something. A ship. Four lifeforms. They're
trying to escape. How do you suggest we proceed? Destroy the vessel, or
assimilate it? <br>
SEVEN: Neither. There are only four lifeforms and the vessel is
heavily damaged. It would be an inefficient use of our resources. We
should ignore it. <br>
QUEEN: In this case, our thoughts are not one. If those individuals are
allowed to survive, species one zero zero two six will survive and
continue to resist us. But that's what you were hoping for, wasn't it?
You tried to mask their lifesigns, but I detected them. <br>(A tractor beam from a Cube grabs the little ship.)<br>
SEVEN: Release the vessel. <br>
QUEEN: I'm sorry this lesson has to be so painful for you, but you are
a difficult pupil. Abandon your human frailties. They are the cause of
your pain. <br>
SEVEN: Let them go. Please. <br>(The little ship is released.) <br>SEVEN: I thought compassion was irrelevant. </font></p>

[OC]: Field notes, U.S.S. Raven, stardate 32634.9. The Raven was hit by
a subspace particle storm. We took heavy damage and our multi-adaptive

it was long enough for the Borg to perceive us as a threat. </font></p>

ERIN: We can reinforce structural integrity. <br>
MAGNUS: We'll find somewhere else to hide. <br>

ERIN [OC]: The entire Collective knows about us by now. They'll send
more ships. <br>
MAGNUS [OC]: The nebula's too dangerous. </font></p>

We've had close calls before. This is no different. Remember when the

ERIN: And you had to spend the night in a maturation chamber, with
fifty two neonatal drones. A transwarp conduit, two point three light
years starboard. It's a Cube heading right for us. <br>
MAGNUS: Time to intercept? <br>
ERIN: One hour, maybe less. <br>

Hey. <br>

MAGNUS: Not if I can help it. Go back to sleep, your mother and I have
work to do. <br>
ANNIKA: Are the Borg mad at us? <br>
MAGNUS: No. <br>
ANNIKA: Then why are they chasing our ship? <br>
MAGNUS: They're curious about us, like we are about them. But don't
worry, we won't let them get too close. <br>
ANNIKA: Can't we go home? <br>
MAGNUS: Soon. <br>
ANNIKA: Papa, will it hurt to be a drone? <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: Hmm. <br>
EMH: I'd like to suggest a few modifications to the comm. array. <br>
JANEWAY: Yes? <br>
EMH: I've studied Seven's cranial schematics and I've isolated the
frequency of her interplexing beacon. When we catch up with the Sphere,
we might be able to send her a brief message. <br>
JANEWAY: What if she's already been linked to the hive mind? <br>
EMH: Every drone has its own translink signature. Only Seven will be
able to hear our message. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll give you a hand. <br>
EMH: The Hansen Diaries. Not exactly light reading. <br>
JANEWAY: I've been poring over their last log entries for any details
we might have missed. I want to make sure history doesn't repeat
itself. <br>
EMH: They should have quit while they were ahead. Ten million
terraquads of data, three years in the wild. <br>
JANEWAY: They could have studied the Borg for another three decades and
still have barely scratched the surface. I agree their methods were
unorthodox, but that's been true of most great explorers. <br>
EMH: Most explorers don't take their four year old daughter along for
the ride. <br>
JANEWAY: We'll get her back, Doctor, with her parents' help. <br>
PARIS: Captain, I've got a fix on the Sphere's location. It's in a
region about two hundred light years from here. <br>
JANEWAY: Red alert. Bring the multi-adaptive shielding online. Set a
course for those coordinates and prepare to disengage transwarp drive. <br>(Later, in normal space, they approach the Unicomplex.)<br>JANEWAY: Report. <br>
TUVOK: I'm detecting thousands of integrated substructures, trillions
of lifeforms, all Borg. <br>
PARIS: There's a Cube coming up fast off our port bow. &nbsp;<br>(And straight past.)<br>
JANEWAY: Did they detect us? <br>
TUVOK: I don't believe so. <br>
JANEWAY: Any sign of our Sphere? <br>
PARIS: Yes, ma'am. Its ion signature leads directly to that whatever it
is. <br>
JANEWAY: Take us in, Mister Paris, minimum thrusters. Begin scanning
for Seven, Tuvok.<br>
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Borg
Queen's chamber]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> QUEEN:
I have a task for you. We're planning to deploy a new mode of
assimilation designed for highly resistant species. I want you to
programme the nanoprobes. <br>
SEVEN: Your technology has changed since I left the Collective. My
knowledge is insufficient. <br>
QUEEN: Your knowledge for the target species is invaluable. Species
five six one eight. Human. Warp capable. Origin, grid three two five.
Physiology inefficient, below average cranial capacity, minimal
redundant systems, limited regenerative abilities. Our previous
attempts to assimilate them were all direct assaults. They failed, so
we've created a more surreptitious strategy. <br>
SEVEN: You intend to detonate a biogenic charge in Earth's atmosphere. <br>
QUEEN: It would infect all lifeforms with nanoprobe viruses.
Assimilation would be gradual. By the time they realised what was
happening, half their population would be drones. <br>
SEVEN: Inefficient. The virus would take years to proliferate. <br>
QUEEN: We've waited this long. Interface with the central alcove. Begin
programming the nanoprobes. Be sure to enhance the viral sequencers.
You've been involved in hundreds of assimilations. This is no
different. <br>
SEVEN: To you, perhaps. Part of me is still human. I will not assist in
their destruction. <br>
QUEEN: We all originated from lesser species. I myself came from
species one two five. But that's irrelevant now. We are Borg. <br>
SEVEN: I am an individual. <br>
QUEEN: You're only repeating their words. You sound like a mindless
automaton. Comply, or we will turn you into a drone. <br>
SEVEN: Proceed, if you wish. <br>
QUEEN: You're torn between your desire to be one with us and your
loyalty to them. It's time for you to complete your task. All of your
emotions, grief, guilt, remorse, compassion, will be irrelevant once
humanity is assimilated. Forget Voyager. They were never your
Collective. <br>(Drones surround them closely.)<br>
SEVEN: I am Annika Hansen. Human. <br>
QUEEN: I remember Annika. Does she remember us? She wasn't afraid. Why
are you? <br>
SEVEN: You attacked us. You murdered my family. <br>
QUEEN: We did no such thing. We gave them perfection. <br>(A drone steps forward. It is Magnus, her father.)<br>
SEVEN: Papa. <br>
QUEEN: Your family's here. You're here. Be one with us again. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Seven of Nine, we're searching for you. Try to hang on. <br>
SEVEN: Captain. <br>
QUEEN: What did you say? <br>
SEVEN: Nothing. <br>
QUEEN: Janeway. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Our transmission's being deflected. <br>
EMH: By whom? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm not certain. <br>
TUVOK: I have isolated Seven's position. She's inside a large
infrastructure approximately six hundred kilometres away. <br>
JANEWAY: Set a course, Mister Paris. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Borg

She's close. Her comm. signal originated within this spatial grid, but
we can't detect her vessel. He knows why. Your father designed the
technology Captain Janeway's using. Multi-adaptive shielding. Your
perfect defence against the Borg. But we assimilated that knowledge,
didn't we? We will adapt easily. </font></p>
