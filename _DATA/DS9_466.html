QUARK: Vole infestations are not uncommon on this station. If you don't
believe me, ask Chief O'Brien. <br>
ODO: When I came in, he and Morn were painting numbers on the voles'
backs. <br>
QUARK: We were just counting them to see how many we'd caught. <br>
SISKO: You were getting ready to stage a vole fight. <br>
QUARK: A vole fight? I'm appalled. Do you really think that was what
Morn was up to? <br>
SISKO: Constable, I want the voles confiscated and removed from the
station. <br>
QUARK: You can't confiscate Morn's voles. They're like his pets. <br>
SISKO: I'll see if I can get him some goldfish. Now, gentlemen, if you
will excuse me, it's late. <br>

guess you've got a lot of questions. <br>
SISKO: Not as many as you think. <br>
O'BRIEN: You know where we are? <br>
SISKO: If I had to guess, I'd say that this is the same parallel
universe that two of my crewmembers visited a year ago. <br>
O'BRIEN: You're quick. Just like our Sisko. That saves me having to
give you a history lesson. But I'd better update you on current events.
Since your officers left here, we've started a rebellion against the
Klingon-Cardassian Alliance. We're fighting for our lives. <br>
SISKO: I wish you luck, but I don't see what that has to do with me. <br>
O'BRIEN: It has everything to do with you. You were the leader of the
Terran Rebellion. At least, our Benjamin Sisko was. <br>
SISKO: Was? <br>
O'BRIEN: Captain Sisko's dead. The Cardassians blew up his ship. <br>
SISKO: Ah. So you want me to take his place. <br>
O'BRIEN: Like I said, you're quick. <br>
SISKO: Well, I've got a better idea. We're going to walk back to the
transporter pad and you're going to send me home. <br>
O'BRIEN: Wait. Hear me out. I'm not asking for a lifetime commitment.
All I need is for you to finish the mission Sisko was on when he was
killed. <br>
SISKO: I'm sorry, but you're going to have to find someone else. I
don't belong here and I'm not about to interfere with events going on
in this universe. <br>
O'BRIEN: At least let me tell you about the mission. And then if you
decide not to help, I'll send you home. There's a Terran scientist
working for the Alliance. Our sources tell us she's close to completing
a new transpectral sensor array that will allow the Alliance to locate
our bases in the Badlands. Without a safe place to hide, the Alliance
will be able to track us down and kill us all. <br>
SISKO: So, you want me to prevent this scientist from finishing her
project? <br>
O'BRIEN: Captain Sisko was convinced he could change her mind, get her
to work for us instead. <br>
SISKO: How did he plan to do that? <br>
O'BRIEN: She was his wife. <br>
(O'Brien gives him a picture.) <br>
SISKO: Jennifer. <br>
O'BRIEN: You know her? <br>
SISKO: She was my wife too. But in my universe, she's dead. <br>
O'BRIEN: Not here she isn't. Not yet, anyway. <br>
SISKO: What do you mean not yet? <br>
O'BRIEN: Unless you can persuade Professor Sisko to join our cause,
we'll have no choice but to kill her. <br>
SISKO: Kill her? <br>
O'BRIEN: We cannot let her finish the sensor array. It'd mean the end
of the rebellion. <br>
SISKO: I can't let her die. Not again. <br>
O'BRIEN: You're the only one who can save her.

finished, the answer is <br>
KIRA: As soon as possible. I know. <br>
JENNIFER: Will that be all? I have to get back to work. <br>
KIRA: I have news of your husband. <br>
JENNIFER: Nothing you could tell me about Ben would interest me. I
haven't even seen him in five years. <br>
KIRA: I know that. And I hope that will make this easier for you. You
see, Benjamin is dead. <br>
JENNIFER: Can I go now? <br>

become so cold. <br>
JENNIFER: Were other Terrans killed with him? <br>
KIRA: A whole ship full. <br>
JENNIFER: All this killing, it has to stop. <br>
KIRA: And it will. As soon as you complete your transpectral sensors
we'll be able to locate the rebel bases, disarm them and put an end to
all this bloodshed. And I will be able to resume pressing the Alliance
to become more reasonable to its Terran population. You do believe me,

and then you get me home. <br>
O'BRIEN: You get us Jennifer, you can have anything you want. I just
hope you can convince her to leave Terok Nor. <br>
SISKO: I don't understand what Jennifer's doing helping the Alliance in
the first place. I mean, didn't she know that Sisko was leading the
Rebellion? <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh, she knew. The truth is, she and Captain Sisko didn't get
along too well. Then again, the captain didn't really get along with
anyone. In some ways the rebellion's better off without him. Don't get
me wrong, the captain knew how to fight but that's about all he knew. <br>

haven't told you half of what you need to know. I hope you don't run up

right. <br>
ROM: I say we teach the Alliance a lesson. Throw everything we've got
at Terok Nor and rip it to pieces. <br>
TUVOK: I disagree. Following your suggestion would do nothing to
enhance our goals and would result in a significant loss of life. <br>
ROM: That's easy for you to say. Those Cardassian pigs didn't kill your
brother. <br>
TUVOK: We have all suffered losses at the hands of the Alliance.
Nonetheless, logic dictates caution in the face of a superior enemy. <br>
ROM: Logic isn't going to win us our freedom. We have to take action. <br>
BASHIR: And we will. But this time we do it my way. <br>
TUVOK: And what do you propose we do? <br>
BASHIR: We smuggle explosives aboard the station, plant them in her
quarters, and detonate them. <br>
TUVOK: You realise it is highly unlikely that anyone assigned to such a
mission would survive. <br>
BASHIR: I say it's worth the risk. <br>
SISKO: Does that mean you're volunteering for the job? <br>
ROM: Captain, you're alive. <br>

Sisko's death, and the imminent completion of the transpectral sensor
array, the Rebellion is certain to collapse. <br>

Alliance, think how important she could be to us. We could use a
scientist on our side. <br>

JENNIFER: You're fighting because you like to fight, Benjamin. The only
thing you've accomplished is to give the Alliance an excuse to treat
the Terrans worse than before. I just hope that with your capture, this
rebellion can be ended peacefully. <br>
SISKO: Who said I'd been captured? <br>
JENNIFER: Oh, I suppose you came here just to see me? <br>
SISKO: Actually, I came here to rescue you. <br>
JENNIFER: Rescue me? <br>
SISKO: That's what I said. <br>
JENNIFER: I'm not going anywhere with you. <br>
SISKO: You can't stay here. <br>
JENNIFER: I have a job to finish. <br>
SISKO: You mean the sensor array? <br>
JENNIFER: That's right. <br>
SISKO: If you finish the array you'll destroy any hope our people have
for a better future. I don't think you want that. <br>
JENNIFER: All I want to do is to put an end to all this fighting. To
force the rebels to seek a peaceful settlement with the Alliance. <br>
SISKO: It's not that simple. The Alliance isn't interested in a
peaceful settlement. If we lay down our arms, we'll all be killed. <br>
JENNIFER: The rebellion is killing people every day. It has to stop. <br>
SISKO: Not this way. Not while the Terrans are still at the mercy of
the Alliance. They're your own people, Jennifer. <br>
JENNIFER: You have no right to talk to me like that. Since when do you
care about what happens to our people? You've never cared about anyone
but yourself. <br>
SISKO: Maybe I've changed in the past few years. <br>
JENNIFER: How many times have I heard you say that? <br>
SISKO: I guess I was a pretty lousy husband. <br>
JENNIFER: You guess? <br>
SISKO: Look, I know it's too late for an apology. <br>
JENNIFER: You're right about that. <br>
SISKO: But for what it's worth, I'm sorry. What is it? <br>
JENNIFER: For a second, I almost believed you. You know what I wish? I
wish I'd never met you. <br>
SISKO: And I wish things could've been better between us. But this
isn't about us. Or is it? Why are you working for the Alliance? Is it
because you believe in what they're doing or is it something else? <br>
JENNIFER: I don't know what you're talking about. <br>
SISKO: I think the two of us have been fighting each other for so long
that you've gotten used to us being on opposite sides. But I'm not the
enemy this time, Jennifer. The Alliance is. <br>
JENNIFER: The Alliance is your enemy, not mine. <br>
SISKO: That's where you're wrong. Don't you see, you're no different
than the slaves working in the ore processing centre. In fact, you may
even be worse off. At least they know they're prisoners. <br>
JENNIFER: What if I am a prisoner? <br>
SISKO: You don't have to be. Fight back. Come with me. <br>
JENNIFER: You want me to join the rebellion? <br>
SISKO: The way I see it, freedom is a lot better than slavery. Think
about it. <br>

SISKO: Jennifer, I need an answer. Are you coming with me or not? <br>
JENNIFER: Do I have a choice? <br>
SISKO: Of course you do. If you want, you can go back to your quarters
and forget we ever spoke. It's up to you. <br>
JENNIFER: All right. But lets get one thing clear. <br>
SISKO: What's that? <br>
JENNIFER: I still hate you. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CARDASSIAN: Terran, what are you doing down there? <br>
O'BRIEN: Re-routing the central ODN processor. The Intendant's orders. <br>
CARDASSIAN: I don't recall receiving clearance for any repairs. <br>
(O'Brien knocks him out.) <br>
O'BRIEN: You don't say? <br>
(There are bangs, the lights flicker and the doors open. O'Brien grabs
the Cardassian's phaser and shoots another guard while the workers take
care of another.) <br>
O'BRIEN: All right, anyone who wants to get out of here, follow me.
Come on.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JENNIFER: You still haven't told me where we're
going. <br>
SISKO: Airlock seven. There should be a ship waiting there for us.
Providing we can get there before the security systems reactivate. <br>
VOICE [OC]: You two look in there. <br>
SISKO: Get back. <br>
(Sisko shoots a Cardassian and they run. Another catches up to them and
shoots the bulkhead. They are trapped by a porthole.) <br>
JENNIFER: Now what? <br>
SISKO: I'll think of something. <br>
(Reinforcements arrive.) <br>
O'BRIEN: Hey! <br>
(The Cardassians are killed in the crossfire. <br>
SISKO: Good work, Smiley. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yeah. The only problem is there's thirty more of them behind
us. <br>
SISKO: Then we'd better get to the airlock. <br>

JENNIFER: Something tells me that's not part of your plan. <br>
O'BRIEN: We've got to find another way out of here. <br>
SISKO: Got any suggestions? <br>
(Phaser fire around the corner.) <br>
SISKO: Fall back. <br>
(A worker gets shot as they retreat.) <br>
KIRA: That was very clever, Benjamin, having one of your own men betray
you so you could get aboard the station. I was completely fooled.
Fortunately Mister Garak is somewhat more cynical than I am. <br>
GARAK: Your Ferengi friend told us of your entire plan, with a little
persuasion of course. <br>
KIRA: I'm afraid there's no escape. Your ship's locked down, your
pilot's dead. There's no way out. You might as well surrender. <br>
O'BRIEN: If we surrender, she'll kill us. <br>
SISKO: Maybe us, but not Jennifer. <br>
JENNIFER: What if we offer a trade? I stay here and she lets you live. <br>
KIRA: Benjamin, you know how I hate to be kept waiting. <br>
SISKO: I came a long way to get you out of here, and I'm not going to
leave without you. What is it? <br>
JENNIFER: Nothing. <br>
SISKO: Smiley, how far is the ore processing centre? <br>
O'BRIEN: Only a couple of levels. <br>
KIRA: Time's up, Benjamin. Benjamin! <br>
GARAK: Pursue! <br>
KIRA: He always has to make things difficult. <br>
GARAK: It's one of his least endearing qualities.

out of this room except through that door. <br>
SISKO: Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. I just hope your Terok Nor
was designed by the same Cardassian that built my Terok Nor.

KIRA: Jennifer. Oh, I was so worried about you. But you're safe now. In
fact, I can assure you that your husband will never annoy you again. <br>
JENNIFER: Actually, for the first time since I've met him, he's not
annoying me. In fact, he's been making a lot of sense. <br>
KIRA: Well, he can be very persuasive when he wants to be. I suppose
this means you won't be finishing the sensor array. <br>
JENNIFER: I'm a Terran. <br>
KIRA: Keep her alive. Kill the others. <br>
SISKO: Oh, I wouldn't. You'd be making a mistake. <br>
KIRA: The only mistake I made was not executing you in the first place.
<br>
SISKO: You don't know how right you are. I have activated the station's
self-destruct sequence. Unless I disarm it, this whole place will blow
up in nine minutes. <br>
(Garak laughs.) <br>
KIRA: That's impossible. There's no way you could know the station's
command access code. <br>
SISKO: Alpha nine one seven five blue. <br>
KIRA: Computer, disengage self-destruct sequence. Authorisation Kira
alpha nine one seven five blue. <br>
COMPUTER: Authorisation denied. <br>
SISKO: I changed it. You have eight minutes and thirty seconds to let
us go. Otherwise we all die. <br>
GARAK: Don't listen to him. He's bluffing. <br>
KIRA: He's not bluffing. <br>
GARAK: How do you know? <br>
KIRA: I know. Give me the new access code and I'll let you go. <br>
SISKO: I will give you the access code once my friends and I are safely
away from the station. Do we have a deal? <br>
KIRA: This isn't over Benjamin. I'll hunt you down. I swear it. <br>
SISKO: You're welcome to try.

SISKO: Jennifer, there's so much I want to tell you. I just don't know

husband? He's dead, isn't he? <br>
SISKO: I'm sorry. <br>
JENNIFER: Don't be. Who are you, really? <br>
SISKO: It's a long story. But ask Smiley. He can fill you in on the
details. <br>
JENNIFER: He seems like a good man. <br>
SISKO: He does at that. So, what are you going to do now? <br>
JENNIFER: Oh, I'm sure Smiley'll find something to keep me busy. You're
not really going to visit the Romulans, are you. <br>
SISKO: The deal was that I get you off the station, and then I go home.
