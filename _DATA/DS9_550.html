big success. <br>
KIRA: Oh, everyone seemed to enjoy it. Thank you, Captain. <br>
SISKO: For what? <br>
KIRA: For insisting that the festival take place in spite of the fact
that we're in the middle of a war. <br>
SISKO: War or no war, we have a lot to be grateful for, and we must
remember that. <br>
KIRA: Yes, we must. Shouldn't you be heading over to the wardroom for

ODO: Don't you want to hear my side of the story? <br>
KIRA: No. <br>
ODO: Somebody has to maintain order on the Promenade. <br>
KIRA: You arrested a Vedek. <br>
ODO: I'd hardly call it an arrest. He wasn't in the holding cell for
more than an hour. Besides, he broke the law. Fundraising on the
Promenade without a licence is strictly forbidden. Station regulation
fifteen twenty six, paragraph seven. <br>
KIRA: Vedek Solis was raising funds for Bajoran flood victims. <br>
ODO: A very worthy cause. Nevertheless, station regulations are quite
clear. <br>
KIRA: I don't care about station regulations. <br>
ODO: Is that the Orb of Contemplation? <br>

recognition of your remarkable leadership and meritorious conduct
against the enemy, and in particular for personal acts of bravery
displayed during the battle to retake Deep Space Nine, Starfleet
Command is proud to present you the Christopher Pike Medal of Valour.
Congratulations, Ben. <br>

ROSS: Now if you would all excuse us, I'd like a word with the Captain.
<br>
(Everyone else leaves.) <br>
ROSS: Good news, Ben. Starfleet Command has decided we've been waging a
defensive war long enough. They figure we're never going to win this
thing unless we take the fight into Dominion territory. Now, I know. I
know you've been saying that since the Romulans opened a second front
with the Dominion. It took a while, but your message finally got
through. <br>
SISKO: When do we go? <br>
ROSS: That all depends on you. <br>
SISKO: Me? <br>
ROSS: That's right, Ben. Starfleet has chosen you to plan the invasion
of Cardassia.

we've been looking for. <br>
SISKO: Now all we have to do is to convince the Romulans to join us. <br>

DAMAR: You're worrying about nothing. <br>
WEYOUN: Am I? It's a mistake to underestimate our enemy, Damar. You're
spreading our forces too thinly. <br>
DAMAR: Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma
Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new
ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. <br>
WEYOUN: And in doing so, you left the Chin'toka system vulnerable. <br>
DAMAR: Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to
protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital
weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields
and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. <br>
WEYOUN: I like them. <br>
DAMAR: I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. <br>
(An aide enters.) <br>
GLINN: Legate Damar, excuse the interruption but we have a problem. <br>
DAMAR: What kind of a problem? <br>
DUKAT: Me. Well, isn't anyone going to welcome me home? <br>
WEYOUN: Heroes get welcomed home, Dukat, not failures. Or have you
forgotten that under your leadership the Dominion nearly lost this war?
<br>
DUKAT: As I recall, Weyoun, you were standing right by my side agreeing
with every decision I made. <br>
DAMAR: If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. <br>
DUKAT: Damar, you disappoint me. I would have thought you, of all
people, would be glad to see your old mentor. I don't hold you
responsible for Ziyal's death. You may have fired the phaser, but it
was Benjamin Sisko who forced your hand. And that's why I'm here. The
time has come for me to take my revenge against the good captain. <br>
WEYOUN: We're in the middle of a life and death struggle for control of
the entire Alpha Quadrant, and all you care about is quenching your
petty thirst for revenge. You haven't changed a bit, have you? <br>
DUKAT: On the contrary, I'm a new man. I no longer have a need for
conquest or power. I'm far beyond all that. I exist in a state of
complete clarity. A clarity I intend to share with the universe. <br>
WEYOUN: You're right, Dukat, you have changed. You've gone from being a
self important egotist to a self deluded madman. I hardly call that an
improvement. I don't have time for this. Remove him. <br>
DAMAR: Wait. Why did you come? <br>
DUKAT: Isn't that obvious? To give you what you desire above all else.
The Alpha Quadrant. All I need is a certain Bajoran artefact. One of
the many the Cardassians appropriated during the occupation. <br>
WEYOUN: And how is this artefact going to help us? <br>
DUKAT: Let's just say it will make it possible for Dominion
reinforcements to come through that wormhole and destroy Captain Sisko
and the Federation once and for all.

LETANT: (Romulan) Really, Captain, I see no reason why I should sit
here and allow this Klingon jackal to call me a coward. <br>
MARTOK: Apparently, this jackal has more courage than the entire
Romulan Senate. <br>
LETANT: You see my point? <br>
WORF: General, you must try to remain calm. <br>
MARTOK: This is not the time for calm. It's time to strike the enemy
and strike them hard. <br>
SISKO: We found their weak point. Now we need to exploit it. <br>
MARTOK: But this p'tagh would rather sit home and count his dead. <br>
LETANT: If we invade Cardassia now, all we'll do is count our dead. <br>
SISKO: Gentlemen, please. We're allies, remember that. <br>
MARTOK: What good is an ally who'll stab you in the back? <br>
LETANT: (to aide) Notice the primitive rage in his eye, the
uncontrolled brutality. Klingons can be quite entertaining, can't they?
Every Romulan zoo should have a pair. <br>
SISKO: Sit down, General! Save your anger for the Dominion. Senator,
you've studied our invasion plans. <br>
LETANT: Yes, I have. And I continue to find them premature. Let the
Dominion continue to send its fleets against us and we will annihilate
them one by one. <br>
ROSS: And they'll continue to rebuild their ships and send more. <br>
WORF: The Dominion breed Jem'Hadar faster than we can destroy them. <br>
SISKO: The only way to achieve a lasting victory is to demolish their
shipyards, their weapon plants, to force them to retreat deeper and
deeper into their own territory until our ships can surround their
headquarters on Cardassia Prime and they will have no choice but to
surrender. I know it won't be easy. I know that we will pay a heavy
price for every system we take from them. But in the end, that's the
only way to drive the Dominion out of the Alpha Quadrant, and that is a
goal we all share. Klingons, humans and Romulans.

LETANT: And leave it to a Klingon to leap to the wrong conclusion. The
Romulan Empire has agreed to join the invasion of Cardassia and we live
up to our agreements. The only question is, can the invasion be
launched before the defensive grid is activated? <br>

to be both, and up to now I've been patient. I've indulged you, I've

(Dukat takes candles from his knapsack during his speech and lights
them.) <br>
DUKAT: And I've come to realize that the wormhole is much more than the
gateway to the Gamma Quadrant. It's the Temple of the Prophets. It's
from there that they smile benevolently down on Bajor. It's from there
that they protect that world and its people. The sad truth is, we
wasted our time fighting the Bajorans when we should've been fighting
their gods. <br>

Preparing to engage. <br>
SISKO: Good luck, General. <br>
(The Jem'Hadar do kamikaze runs at the Klingons to destroy the ships.) <br>
NOG: I always thought the Jem'Hadar were crazy. <br>
GARAK: There's method to their madness. They're inflicting considerable
damage on the Klingons. <br>
WORF: And buying time to get their weapon platforms operational. <br>
SISKO: Sisko to Martok. <br>
MARTOK [on viewscreen]: The Jem'Hadar have managed to cripple or
destroy fifteen of my ships. <br>
SISKO: Do you need any assistance? <br>
MARTOK [on viewscreen]: That won't be necessary. Commence firing on the
weapon platforms. <br>
(Ka-BOOM go a few platforms, then as the fleet move into the system,
the rest spring to life. They open their spider legs and start firing
at our ships, cutting big holes in hulls.)

DAX: Kira said a prayer for me and Worf last night. She told the

Pah Wraith energy lifts her off the floor. Then he lets her drop. She
lies very still. Dukat goes through the protective forcefield and takes
hold of the Orb box. He opens it and the Pah wraith energy rushes into
it. The orb turns from gleaming crystal to dull black. He screams and
drops to his knees, no longer possessed. Outside the wormhole opens

SISKO: I'm not sure. I think I felt the Prophets reaching out to me.
Something's wrong. <br>
O'BRIEN: Sir, I found it. There's a subspace power generator on a small
moon orbiting the far planet. It's transmitting energy to the weapon

O'BRIEN: Maybe we can't destroy that power generator, but I bet those
weapon platforms could. <br>
KIRA: Why would they fire on their own power source? <br>
GARAK: We'd have to fool the platforms' targeting systems into thinking
the generator's an enemy ship. <br>
O'BRIEN: We can use our deflector array to imprint a Federation warp
signature on the generator's energy matrix. <br>

I planned, but I assure you we still achieved a great victory. <br>

DUKAT [on monitor]: Well you should. The Bajoran people have been cut
off from their gods, perhaps forever. <br>
DAMAR: How does that help us? <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: Because Sisko has been cut off from the Prophets as
well. And without the Prophets, he's just another Starfleet captain. <br>

hell of a lot of fun with both of you, but Curzon was my mentor. You,
you were my friend and I am going to miss you. I should have listened
to the Prophets and not gone to Cardassia. Then maybe you'd still be
alive. Damn it! Why aren't you still here, Jadzia? I need you to help
me sort things out. Something's happened to the Prophets, something
that's made them turn their backs on Bajor and I'm responsible. And I
don't know what to do about it, how to make it right again. I've failed
as the Emissary, and for the first time in my life I've failed in my
duty as a Starfleet officer. I need time to think, clear my head, but I
can't do it here. Not on the station, not now. I need to get away and
find a way to figure out how to make things right again. I have to make
