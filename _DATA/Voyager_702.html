look a little pale. <br>
KIM: I volunteered for a test flight, not a suicide mission.<br>
PARIS: How can we put the new Delta Flyer through her paces without
taking a few risks?<br>
KIM: Another risk like that and we'll have to rebuild her all over
again. There's a vessel coming up fast off our starboard beam. <br>
PARIS: Shields. <br>
KIM: Range fifty kilometres. Ten. It's pulling alongside. <br>
PARIS: Wow, nice ship.<br>
KIM: It's scanning us.<br>
PARIS: This is Lieutenant Tom Paris. Please identify yourself. <br>
IRINA [OC]: Vectored exhaust ports, accelerated driver coils. Your
vessel must be fast. <br>
PARIS: Gets us where we want to go. <br>
IRINA [OC]: Check your scanners. You'll see a comet on the other side
of the asteroid field. I wonder which of our ships could get there
first? <br>
PARIS: Sounds like a challenge. <br>
IRINA [OC]: Are you going to accept?<br>
KIM: We are not going to race her. <br>
PARIS: This is a test flight, right?<br>
KIM: Yeah, but <br>
PARIS: What better way to test the new ship than to see how it stands
up to a little competition? We're ready over here. Shall I count to
three? <br>(Irina accelerates away.)<br>PARIS: Guess not. She's a lot more manoeuvrable
than we are. <br>
KIM: Not that I'm endorsing this misguided exercise, but maybe we can
even the odds. New impulse thrusters. <br>
PARIS: Now that's the spirit, Harry. <br>(A pair of thrusters open up at the rear of the Flyer.)<br>
KIM: We're catching up. A hundred metres, fifty. <br>PARIS: Bring the backup generators online and reroute power to the
thrusters. <br>(Irina's ship clips an asteroid and her starboard nacelle starts venting.)<br>PARIS: And it's the Delta Flyer by a nose. <br>
KIM: Something's wrong with her ship. The cabin's filling up with
nyocene gas. <br>
PARIS: Stand by for emergency transport. <br>(A humanoid female with pointed ears and tight leather trousers is beamed aboard, coughing.)<br>
KIM: Are you all right? <br>
IRINA: I think so. <br>
KIM: I told you this wasn't a good idea.<br>
IRINA: Does that mean you’re afraid to try again?<br>
PARIS: Yeah, Harry, you afraid?<br>
KIM: No, of course not. It's just that your ship is in no shape for a
rematch. <br>
IRINA: My power transformer overloaded. <br>
KIM: I bet we could find you a spare back on Voyager. We were about to
head back anyway. Right, Tom? <br>

I've been looking forward to my holodeck time all week. Why can't you
borrow three hours from someone else? <br>
TORRES: Yours are the last piece to the puzzle. Tom and I have finally
managed to get a weekend off together. I've been trading favours with
members so that we could get the holodeck to ourselves. <br>
EMH: A romantic getaway. <br>
TORRES: Well, that's the idea, yes. <br>
EMH: Well, ordinarily I wouldn't hesitate to oblige but I've been
looking forward to indulging myself in a new hobby. Something human
doctors have been enjoying for centuries. <br>(He picks up a golf club and ball.)
<br>EMH: I've already booked a tee time. <br>
TORRES: Well, if your tee time is more important than our happiness.
Our first chance to be alone in months.<br>
EMH: Fine. Take my three hours. <br>
TORRES: Thank you. <br>
EMH: So, what programme are you planning to run? <br>
TORRES: Something new, called Gedi Prime. <br>
EMH: I've heard of that. The vacation paradise that makes Risa look
like a tourist trap. <br>
TORRES Endless kilometres of crystalline beaches, mood reefs,
bioluminescent waterfalls. <br>
EMH: And a championship golf course, if I'm not mistaken. Why don't I
just join you? <br>
TORRES: Somehow I don't think that would add to the mood. <br>

KIM: Co-pilot? <br>

KIM: So, tell me more about where you're from. <br>
IRINA: It's a small trinary system about half a parsec from here. <br>
KIM: Three suns? Must make for some long days. <br>
IRINA: Are you always this inquisitive?<br>
KIM: That depends on who I'm talking to.<br>
PARIS: Your new power transformer is installed and ready to go. <br>
IRINA: Thanks. <br>
PARIS: Your impulse drive is a real beauty. <br>
IRINA: I designed it myself. <br>
PARIS: But I couldn't help noticing your warp system seems so
rudimentary. <br>
IRINA: Warp's fine if you like going fast in a straight line. But to me
that's just physics, not flying. <br>
KIM: I guess it's just a matter of taste. <br>
IRINA: Anyway, for the kind of flying I'm here for, warp is not a
factor. The race course is only two billion kilometres long. <br>
PARIS: Race course? <br>
KIM: What kind of race course? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Briefing

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
The Antarian Trans-Stellar Rally. Three segments covering two point
three billion kilometres. <br>
KIM: With obstacles ranging from dwarf star clusters to K class
anomalies. <br>
PARIS: Two man crews and most importantly, each ship is limited to
sub-light speeds. It is the ultimate test of ship design and piloting
skills<br>
TUVOK: Not to mention a serious drain on Voyager's resources. You're
suggesting we reassign fifteen crewmen to modify the Delta Flyer. <br>
PARIS: The race has very specific guidelines. <br>
CHAKOTAY: All the ships have to use enriched deuterium fuel. The Delta
Flyer's not
equipped for that. <br>
KIM: Irina agreed to lend us a fuel converter. <br>
PARIS: Captain, this race is more than just a sporting event. Until
recently this region was a war zone. Four different species fought for
nearly a century to control it. <br>
KIM: Now, for the first time, they're competing peacefully to
commemorate the new treaty that ended the war. <br>
PARIS: This race embodies everything the Federation values. Peaceful
coexistence, free exchange of ideas <br>
JANEWAY: I think it’s a great idea. <br>
PARIS: You do? <br>
TUVOK: You do? <br>
JANEWAY: Absolutely. This competition is just the sort of break we
need. It would give us the chance to make some friends, and allow the
crew a little R and R. Request granted. <br>
PARIS: Thank you, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: One thing, gentleman. Now that we’re in this race, we’re in it
to win. After all, Starfleet’s honour is at stake.<br>

meant to be played indoors. <br>

putting into beakers in Sickbay, thanks to you. <br>
PARIS: Me? <br>

EMH: Don’t tell me you forgot. <br>
PARIS: Do me a favour Doc. Keep a lock on my biosigns. <br>

TORRES: Problem? <br>
PARIS: I have the chance to pilot the Flyer in a race. A really unique
race and the captain thinks it’s a great idea, and I guess I got so
excited I forgot about our plans. But I don’t have to do it. The captain would understand. <br>
TORRES: It’s all right. <br>
PARIS: No, no. I should have remembered. This just seemed like such an
amazing opportunity. Pilots from all over <br>

NEELIX: What about your weekend with Tom? <br>
TORRES: He just cancelled it.<br>
NEELIX: Does he have any idea how much planning it took?<br>
TORRES: No. And you’re not going to tell him, either. He just entered
this big race, and he’s really excited and, I don’t want to spoil it for
him.<br>
NEELIX: I'm sure if you tell him how important this weekend was to you,
he’ll reconsider.<br>
TORRES: Probably. But he should be able to do what makes him happy.<br>
NEELIX: What about what makes you happy?<br>
TORRES: It’s time I faced facts, Neelix. Tom and I just don’t belong
together. <br>
NEELIX: Then you’re not in love with him anymore?<br>
TORRES: I didn’t say that. <br>
NEELIX: B’Elanna, if you still love each other<br>
TORRES: Maybe that isn’t enough. <br>
NEELIX: Call me a hopeless romantic, but I still think it is. <br>
TORRES: There’s a Klingon phrase my grandmother used to use. Mok'tah.
It means bad match. That’s what Tom and I are. I just hate that it's
taken me three years to realise it. <br>
NEELIX: If you’re really such a mok'tah, it must have been an awful
three years. <br>
TORRES: No. Tom is a great guy. We’ve had a lot of fun together. And
that seems to be enough for him. But not for me.&nbsp;<br>
NEELIX: Why aren’t you saying all this to Tom? <br>
TORRES: I plan to. After the race. <br>
NEELIX: By which time, he'll have already disappointed you again. I may
not know as much about Klingon tradition as your grandmother, but
somehow, keeping Tom in the dark doesn’t seem very honourable. My feet
are feeling better. I should go back to work.

We have teams that have travelled quite a distance, Captain, but none
from as far as the Alpha Quadrant. <br>
JANEWAY: We're always willing to go that extra light year for a good
cause. <br>
O'ZAAL: Well, your entrance petition seems to be in order. The Delta
Flyer meets our guidelines. Now all you have to do is win. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Something tells me the other teams aren't going to make that
too easy. <br>
TUVOK [OC]: Bridge to the captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Go ahead, Commander. <br>
TUVOK [OC]: There is an incoming transmission for the Ambassador. <br>
JANEWAY: Route it here. <br>
O'ZAAL: I asked not to be disturbed. <br>
ASSISTANT [on monitor]: I'm sorry, but the Aksani are threatening to
withdraw unless they're allowed to host the post-race ceremony. <br>
O'ZAAL: Did you explain that we've already promised that to the Chessu.
<br>
ASSISTANT [on monitor]: Yes. They said that was unacceptable. <br>
O'ZAAL: Arrange for another meeting. I'll have to find some way of
appeasing them. Well, I hope the race you just entered doesn't end before it begins. <br>
JANEWAY: It's that serious?<br>
O'ZAAL: The peace is still very fragile. Every decision I make, no
matter how trivial, is looked upon as symbolic. <br>
JANEWAY: So, every time you make a concession to one participant <br>
O'ZAAL: Another is offended, yes. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe we can help. <br>
O'ZAAL: That would be wonderful, but how? <br>
JANEWAY: By providing neutral ground for the pre- and post-race
activities. Since we've never taken sides in your conflict, you couldn't
be accused of showing favouritism. <br>

not a battle. <br>

SEVEN: I was speaking professionally. I often work with him on
navigational problems. He can be an erratic individual, but he's also a
very competent officer and clearly a skilled pilot. <br>
TORRES: It's the erratic individual that takes getting used to. <br>

Report. <br>
EMH: His condition's stabilising. I should be able to start dermal
regeneration in a few hours. <br>
IRINA: This was Assan's fault. <br>
O'ZAAL: Why? <br>
IRINA: He collided with me so many times my shield generator
overloaded. Joxom's console exploded. He's lucky he's alive. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Briefing

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">ASSAN:
If I'm guilty of anything, it's of coming in second. A situation I'll
remedy in the next leg. <br>
O'ZAAL: You're doing a poor job of defending yourself. <br>
TORRES: We may have had something to do with this too. We grazed both
of their shields while in the
anomaly. <br>
JANEWAY: Intentionally? <br>
PARIS: It was a tight course. Everyone was flying very aggressively. <br>
IRINA: Your team is not responsible, Captain. My generators were
already overloading when they made contact. <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps none of you is to blame. I found this interfaced with
her ship's shield generator. I ran an analysis. It's a phase inverter,
designed to cause a system overload. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, it's hard to believe someone would go this far just to
knock a competitor out of the race? <br>
O'ZAAL: This may be more than a simple case of cheating, Captain. I
think someone's trying to end the peace. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe I'm missing something, but we're talking about a single
act of sabotage. How does that threaten your treaty? <br>
O'ZAAL: By itself it wouldn't. But we received several threats of a
more serious nature. <br>
TUVOK: From whom? <br>
O'ZAAL: Groups opposed to the alliance. Arms dealers, isolationists,
political extremists. Up until now I wasn't sure how seriously to take
them. <br>
TUVOK: Clearly they pose a security threat. <br>
O'ZAAL: Yes, yes. We've done everything we could to protect the races,
but that may not be enough. I don't want to risk any more lives. We
should cancel the race, or at least postpone i,t until we can guarantee
everyone's safety. <br>
IRINA: No. If we stop now we'll be letting these extremists win.<br>
ASSAN: She's right. <br>
O'ZAAL: Very well, then. If that's the consensus, we'll resume tomorrow
as scheduled. Of course, Captain, if you decide to withdraw, we'd
understand. <br>
JANEWAY: The last time I checked, I believe we were winning.

KIM: Of course, you're not going to win. <br>
TORRES: Why is that? <br>
KIM: Because we are. (to Irina) You're looking at your new co-pilot. I
checked with one of the race officials. It's perfectly legal. And it's
a chance for both of us to get back in the race. <br>
IRINA: I appreciate the gesture, but my ship's damaged. <br>

TORRES: Right at the light, then readjust my sight. <br>

TORRES: Do I really have to spend my morning reciting nursery rhymes? <br>
PARIS: It got me through the Academy. <br>

fly this ship. <br>
TORRES: That one doesn’t even rhyme. <br>

PARIS: Looks like you didn't get much sleep. <br>
KIM: Irina and I were up all night. <br>
PARIS: Oh, really? <br>
KIM: Making repairs. To be honest, I can't remember the last time I had
so much fun. She's funny, smart. We get along without trying. I'm going
to ask her if she wants to spend some time on Voyager after the race. <br>
PARIS: What about Joxom? <br>
KIM: Turns out they're just team-mates. I know what you're going to say
<br>
PARIS: No, no. Actually, I was just going to congratulate you. She's
not a Borg, she's not a hologram, and she's not dead. Looks like you
might have finally found yourself the perfect woman. <br>

PARIS: What glow?<br>
TORRES: You know, that look you get when you first meet someone. <br>
PARIS: Yeah, his cheeks were a little redder than usual. <br>
TORRES: We're through the pulsars. Harry and Irina are right behind us.
<br>
PARIS: Ease up off the thrusters now. I want to conserve some fuel for
the final leg. <br>
TORRES: If circumstances were right they might even have a future
together. <br>
PARIS: What?<br>
TORRES: Harry and Irina. <br>
PARIS: They just met. It's a little early to be planning a wedding. <br>
TORRES: No, I just meant that some people just fit together without
having to work at it. And other people, no matter how much they try <br>
PARIS: Are we talking about them or us? <br>
TORRES: What? No, I didn't mean. <br>
PARIS: If something's bothering you, let's talk about it. <br>

IRINA: We must have missed something. At this rate, we're going to be
out of the race in a couple of minutes. <br>
KIM: I think I can reroute power through the impulse manifolds.<br>
IRINA: No! <br>
KIM: Why not?<br>
IRINA: It could damage the reactor coils. <br>
KIM: What do the reactor coils have to do with the impulse manifolds? <br>
IRINA: These systems are different than what you're used to. <br>
KIM: You do want to win, don't you? <br>
IRINA: Of course I do.<br>
KIM: It just seems like every time I make a suggestion, you find a
reason to reject it. <br>
IRINA: I'm more familiar with my ship than you are.<br>
KIM: Now what? <br>
IRINA: I think it's the injector ports. <br>
KIM: No, it's an overload in my console! <br>(Kim dives out of the way just in time.) <br>KIM: That's the second time your
co-pilot's console exploded. Quite a coincidence. <br>(Irina points a gun at him.)<br>
IRINA:&nbsp;I'm sorry, Harry. I really am. <br>
KIM: You sabotaged your own ship. Twice. Why are you trying so hard to
get out of this race? <br>(He slaps a control and makes the ship jolt. She loses her balance and he wrestles
the gun off her.) <br>KIM: What the hell is going on? Sit down and hold still!
All right, if you won't talk to me, maybe you'll talk to Antarian

fit together as well as Harry and Irina?<br>
TORRES: Could we talk about this later? Assan is gaining on us. <br>

PARIS: Why didn't the computer warn us?<br>
TORRES: The online sensors have been tampered with. <br>
