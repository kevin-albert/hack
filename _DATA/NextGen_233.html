level of the dig. They're typical of second century Marlonian cookware.
Look at those markings. They're very similar to early Taguan designs,
but the patterns are more intricate, they're much closer to Buranian
than Taguan. <br>
GUINAN: You were on the most beautiful planet in the quadrant and you
spent your entire shore leave in a cave? <br>
PICARD: It was a very rewarding experience. Look at these fragments.
They're very nearly in perfect condition and yet they're seven hundred
years old. <br>
GUINAN: So's my father. <br>
RO: Is that a Draebidium froctus? <br>
(Keiko has a tray of plants on her lap) <br>
KEIKO: Actually, it's a Draebidium calimus. You can tell by the shape
of the leaves. I didn't know you were interested in plant biology. <br>
RO: I took a class at the Academy. I Don't remember very much though. <br>
WORF [OC]: Enterprise to shuttlecraft Fermi. <br>
RO: This is the Fermi. Go ahead Enterprise. <br>
WORF [OC]: We have just received a distress signal from the Starfleet
science team on Ligos Seven. <br>
PICARD: Can you identify the problem? <br>
WORF [OC]: No, sir. The call was cut off in mid-transmission. <br>
PICARD: Lay in a course and prepare to engage at warp eight as soon as
we're on board. <br>
WORF [OC]: Aye, sir. <br>
RO: We'll rendezvous with the ship in three minutes, sir. <br>

RIKER: We've trying to scan it, but it's we're running into lot of

shuttlebay three for a triage centre in case they have large numbers of

thank you. It's just so ridiculous. I can't really take myself
seriously like this. Counsellor, if Doctor Crusher can't find a cure,
if I have to stay this way, nobody's going to take me seriously, are
they? <br>
TROI: I would say the people that know you and have worked with you,
will be able to make the adjustment eventually. But there are some
people who would find it difficult to accept a twelve year old captain.
<br>
PICARD JR: In that case, I suppose I'll just have to wait until I grow
up again before I get another command. Which might be in ten, maybe
fifteen years. The question is what to do until then? <br>
TROI: You're still a Starfleet captain. I'm sure there are other
assignments you could be given in the interim. <br>
PICARD JR:: I've spent thirty years of my life aboard starships I'm not
about to sit behind a desk now. <br>
TROI: You could return to the Academy. Take another degree. Brush up on
your Latin. <br>
PICARD JR: And be Wesley Crusher's room mate? I will admit that
returning to the Academy does have a certain appeal, but I've spent my
life looking forward. Going to the Academy again feels like looking
backward. <br>
TROI: Then perhaps you could spend the time exploring another
interests. Archeology, for instance. <br>
PICARD JR: Leave Starfleet? <br>
TROI: Not permanently, just a sabbatical. You could spend a few years
crawling through caves and digging up artefacts, and still have enough
time to become the youngest admiral in Starfleet history. <br>
PICARD JR: It would give me a chance to take up Doctor Langford's offer
and accompany her to the ruins on Suvin Four. But to leave the
Enterprise. <br>

people can only dream about. Have a second childhood without the pain

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: This is Captain Picard's
rybo-viroxic-nucleic structure from a tissue sample I took this
morning. It's the same as a sample I took before the accident, except
it's missing several of the key viroxic sequences. <br>
RIKER: It's been a long time since I took genetics, Doctor. <br>
CRUSHER: RVN is one of the key factors in our development during
puberty. Unlike DNA, which never changes, RVN takes on some additional
viroxic sequences during adolescence. Those sequences determine how we
develop physically. <br>
RIKER: Without them we would never mature into adults. <br>
CRUSHER: Exactly. Somehow, those sequences were eliminated in the
Captain and the others during transport. <br>
RIKER: So what do we do? <br>
CRUSHER: Well, we have a couple of options. These are the plants Keiko
was carrying on the shuttle. Whatever turned the crew into children
turned these plants into seedlings. I accelerated the growth on one of
them, and it developed into a perfectly normal adult plant. <br>
RIKER: I don't suppose that would work with people? <br>
CRUSHER: No, but at least we know that if we do nothing at all, they
will probably grow up just as they did before. <br>
RIKER: That's one option. <br>
CRUSHER: However, I do have the adult RVN patterns of all four of them.
I might be able to send them back through the transporter pattern
buffer and replace the missing sequences. But we can't even attempt
that until we know why this happened in the first place. If somehow
they were to lose more viroxic sequences. <br>
RIKER: They would get even younger.

molecular reversion field, which caused the structure of the ship to
deteriorate. When the field penetrated the hull, it also began to
affect the shuttle's crew. <br>
O'BRIEN: When I tried to beam them off, I wasn't able to get a lock
because the reversion field was masking part of the patterns. <br>
CRUSHER: If the transporter only registered part of the RVN patterns,
that would explain why the key sequences are missing. <br>
LAFORGE: Exactly. With those key sequences missing, the transporter
reconstructed them as children. <br>
RIKER: If they're right, would you be able to use the transporter to
reverse the effects? <br>

their patterns, we should be able to do it. Chief, can you adjust the

taken control of main Engineering and decks twenty three through thirty
seven. <br>

KEIKO JR: Captain, do you know what they've done with the younger
children? With my little girl? <br>
PICARD JR: They're taking all the adults down to the surface. It looks
like they're keeping all the children on board the ship. Where was your
daughter? <br>
KEIKO JR: In primary care on deck fourteen. <br>
PICARD JR: She's probably still there with the others. I wouldn't
worry. We need to regain control of the ship. Options? <br>
RO JR: We could flood the ship with anesthizine gas. <br>
PICARD JR: That's been locked out with the rest of the command
functions. <br>
RO JR: If they're typical Ferengi, they're probably very pleased with
themselves by now. Maybe even getting a little overconfident. <br>
PICARD JR: Agreed. They might think they don't need as much of their
crew to hold the ship. We could use the element of surprise to give us
a tactical advantage. <br>
GUINAN JR: Tactical advantage? Jean-Luc, look at your team for a
minute. We're children. <br>
PICARD JR: We can't just stay here while our ship is being
commandeered. <br>

were still adults. <br>

this little adventure, because you're risking war with the Federation. <br>
LURIN: We're not affiliated with the Ferengi Alliance. We are in
business for ourselves. Yes, it will be highly profitable. For an
investment of two surplus Klingon ships, a few repairs and some
weapons, we've netted a Federation starship and her crew, not to
mention a planet rich in vendarite. <br>
RIKER: So that's what this is all about. What did you do with the
science team that was on the surface? <br>
LURIN: They have proved most helpful in extracting the mineral. <br>
RIKER: You used them as slave labourers. <br>
LURIN: The addition of your crew will greatly speed up the process. As
for your ship, I'm sure that it will fetch a handsome price on the
Romulan market. But before that can happen, we need to regain access to
your central computer. <br>
RIKER: You don't really think I'm going to help you. <br>
