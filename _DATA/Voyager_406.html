Sorry. I didn't realise that you'd been assigned here today.<br>
SEVEN: I wasn't. This space was unoccupied so I came here to work. <br>
TORRES: On what? <br>
SEVEN: I'm reconfiguring the power couplings in this section. <br>
TORRES: Why? <br>
SEVEN: The Astrometrics lab requires additional energy. <br>
TORRES: I see. So you're rerouting power from other locations, like
Engineering? <br>
SEVEN: They are minor adjustments. Primary systems will not be
affected. <br>
TORRES: Unless, of course, someone is trying to do a warp core
diagnostic, which my crew has been trying to do all morning. We have
lost hours of work because of this. <br>
SEVEN: There is no need for anger. I had no intention of causing a
problem. <br>
TORRES: What, sorry isn't in the Borg vocabulary? You need to check
with me before you touch the power systems. Understood? <br>
SEVEN: Understood. <br>(Seven moves aside for Torres.)<br>SEVEN: I am unaccustomed to working in a hierarchy. In the
Collective there was no need to ask permission. <br>
TORRES: If you're going to be a member of this crew, get used to it.
Procedures exist for a reason. We've got to work together. Follow the
same set of rules<br>
SEVEN: Lieutenant? <br>
TORRES: I was given that lecture once, by Captain Janeway when I first
joined this crew. If I could adjust to Starfleet life, so can you. <br>

turn it in, and Chakotay gives me a hard time when it's late. <br>

JANEWAY: I've been too busy. <br>
EMH: The usual story. Have you been getting enough sleep? <br>
JANEWAY: More or less. Mostly less. <br>
EMH: Mmm hmm. And have your headaches been getting any worse? <br>
JANEWAY: No, but they're not getting any better either. They're like
hot needles driving into my skull. <br>
EMH: These symptoms are hardly surprising, Captain. You work absurdly
long hours under constant stress, eating on the run, without sufficient
exercise or rest. Your body is crying out for mercy. <br>
JANEWAY: It certainly is right now, There must be some easier way to do
this, Doctor. A hypospray, maybe? <br>
EMH: Always looking for the simple fix. Sometimes there's no substitute
for intensive osteopathic pressure therapy. You're fortunate to have a
masseur who can work all day without tiring. <br>

I think we can collect some invaluable data. Captain, am I boring you? <br>

eighty million kilometres. <br>

with you for a moment. <br>(Tuvok walks past Paris.)<br>
PARIS: (sotto) Thanks. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't usually pry into the personal lives of my crew, but in
this case I have to question your recent conduct. <br>
PARIS: I guess Tuvok <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok? I haven't heard a word from Tuvok. You two have
been making enough of a public display that half the ship is gossiping
about it. <br>
TORRES: Believe me, that wasn't our intention. <br>
JANEWAY: You are senior officers and I expect you to maintain the
standard for the rest of the crew, but this adolescent behaviour makes
me question my faith in you both. If you choose to pursue a

Commander Chakotay is suffering bone decalcification, tissue necrosis,
decreased visual acuity. All classic signs of aging, but they've
developed within hours. <br>(Chakotay is an wrinkled, bald old man with lots of liver spots on his skin.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Any theories? <br>
EMH: There's a rare genetic disorder called progeria which causes
children to age prematurely. But there's never been an adult case and
it was supposedly eradicated two centuries ago. Even so, I took a close
look at your DNA. These segments regulate your body's metabolism. My
scans indicate that they've been hyper-stimulated somehow. <br>
JANEWAY: What's the prognosis? <br>
EMH: I can't speculate on that until I've identified the cause. There's
no sign of an infectious agent. <br>
JANEWAY: We spent several hours near a binary pulsar that was emitting
intense gamma radiation. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Our shields were operating. I don't see how I could have been
exposed to it. <br>
JANEWAY: At this point we can't rule out anything. I'm going to take a
closer look at the data we collected. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You should also run scans of my quarters, as well as my office
and the bridge. Everywhere I've been today. <br>
EMH: I'm not prepared to send you back on duty yet, Commander. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I may look pretty strange, but my mind is perfectly clear.
I'd rather stay busy than just sit here. <br>
EMH: I have no idea how your symptoms will progress. You should remain
in Sickbay for observation. <br>
JANEWAY: He's right, Chakotay. I'll keep you informed. <br>
EMH: Whatever's affecting the Commander's DNA is working at a
sub-molecular level. I'd like to set up an electron resonance scanner
in the science lab to get a closer look. <br>
JANEWAY: Use whatever you need, and ask B'Elanna to give you a hand. <br>
EMH: Still having headaches, Captain? <br>

Now pay attention, Mister Paris. These scans should indicate whether. Hmm. <br>
NEELIX: What is it? <br>
EMH: It seems that your DNA has been hyper-stimulated, just like
Commander Chakotay's. <br>
PARIS: But Neelix doesn't seem to be aging. <br>
EMH: No, the effects are quite different. <br>
NEELIX: If anything, I look like a Mylean. They occupy a region of
space near Talax. <br>
EMH: Interesting. Do Talaxians and Myleans share a common ancestry? <br>
NEELIX: Not that I know of. <br>
EMH: Do the two races ever intermarry? <br>
NEELIX: Yes. As a matter of fact, my great grandfather was Mylean. <br>
EMH: Then one eighth of your genetic material was inherited from him.
Those must be the genes which have become stimulated. <br>
NEELIX: Too bad my great grandfather wasn't a little better looking. <br>
EMH: Hmm. As far as I can tell, his condition seems stable. I'm going
to leave you in charge of Sickbay so I can continue the DNA analysis. <br>
PARIS: If anyone else comes in I'll run a cellular scan. Is there
anything else I can do? <br>
EMH: Do your best to keep them comfortable. Until we have more
information, that's the best either of us can do. <br>(Later,
Paris is working in the Doctor's office. Neelix walks stiff-legged to
where Chakotay is sitting on a biobed, carrying a glass of water.)<br>
NEELIX: I thought you might be thirsty. <br>

NEELIX: I, I'm afraid that's me. I seem to be developing Mylean sweat
glands. Sorry. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's not so bad. <br>
NEELIX: Well, whatever happens, I try to keep in mind things could be
worse. <br>(Neelix sits next to Chakotay, with a grunt.)<br>NEELIX: I still have my home here on Voyager, my friends. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Your hair. <br>
NEELIX: True. But I'd gladly lose it if I could have my taste buds
back. <br>
CHAKOTAY: At least you're not losing your eyesight. See that display
over there? It's nothing but a blur. <br>
NEELIX: You think that's bad? The Doctor tells me my pupils have
dilated sixty percent. I can't even look at that display, it's so
bright. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Yeah? Well I've got chronic arthritis in my fingers. I could
barely keep this glass steady. <br>
NEELIX: Well, that's nothing. My spinal column is fusing together. In a
matter of days I won't be able to walk.<br>

quickly as possible. <br>

this DNA. Can you give me more magnification? <br>
TORRES: Coming up. <br>(One of the molecules has a marking on it.)<br>
EMH: That's odd. <br>
TORRES: What is? <br>
EMH: There seems to be some kind of contaminant on the base pair
sequence. It didn't show up on the first scan. I need a closer look. <br>
TORRES: I'm going to maximum magnification. What do you see? <br>(An alien bar code.)<br>

TORRES: Well, what does it look like? <br>
EMH: See for yourself. <br>
TORRES: I'm no microbiologist, but that doesn't look like it belongs

sub-molecular technology is well beyond anything Starfleet has
developed. <br>
TORRES: What are those markings? Some kind of alien writing? <br>
EMH: I wish I knew. They might help us determine where it came from. <br>
TORRES: Who could have put this into Chakotay's cells without his
knowledge? Let me try a compositional analysis. <br>(While Torres works at a circular free-standing console, the EMH puts another slide under the microscope.)<br>
EMH: It's in Mister Neelix's DNA as well. <br>
TORRES: Is this what's causing the mutations? <br>
EMH: A good scientist never jumps to conclusions, Lieutenant, but I'd
say it's a distinct possibility. <br>
TORRES: I'm having trouble getting a clear reading from the sample. It
looks almost like the er, whatever it is could be slightly out of
phase. <br>
EMH: That must be why my initial scans didn't reveal it. <br>
TORRES: I'm compensating for the phase variance. You're not going to
believe this, but I'm picking up an energy signature. This thing is
transmitting some kind of a signal. <br>
EMH: To where? <br>
TORRES: I don't know. It's too weak to travel very far. Access the
internal sensors and set them to a phase variance of point one five. <br>

system. <br>
SEVEN: Our first course of action should be to collect more
information. <br>

to your Borg sensory nodes. <br>(The holodeck computer access is inside a lecturn.)<br>

(Doorbell.)<br>JANEWAY: Yes. Yes! <br>
TUVOK: Good morning, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: That's a matter of opinion. What is it? <br>
TUVOK: Internal scans haven't revealed anything about the genetic
mutations. <br>
JANEWAY: The Doctor? <br>
TUVOK: Still offline. We are investigating the possibility <br>
JANEWAY: Inform me of any progress. <br>
TUVOK: Understood. <br>
JANEWAY: There's one more thing. The incident with Tom and B'Elanna's
started me thinking about ship's protocol, or lack thereof. <br>
TUVOK: Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: It seems to me that people have been getting a little too
comfortable around here lately. They're late for their duty shifts,
taking mess hall privileges during non-designated hours. And a lot of
people are spending more time on the holodeck than they are at their
posts. You are Security chief. Don't thirteen department heads report
to you every day? <br>
TUVOK: Yes. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, straighten them out. <br>
TUVOK: Shall I flog them as well? <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe the Doctor was right. I think I do need a vacation. <br>
TUVOK: You do seem unsettled. <br>
JANEWAY: Crazed is more like it. I haven't felt this anxious since my
first day of command. (doorbell) Remind me to lower the volume on that door. Come
in. <br>
SEVEN: Captain, I wish to speak with you about (Seven sees Janeway with
large needles sticking into her head and two aliens monitoring her.)<br>
JANEWAY: What's wrong? <br>
SEVEN: My attempts to repair the resonance scanner have failed. I
require assistance. <br>
JANEWAY: Ask Ensign Kim to lend you a hand. <br>(The aliens twist the needles in Janeway's head.)<br>
SEVEN: Yes, Captain. <br>(Seven leaves.)<br>
JANEWAY: Is that all? When this mutation crisis is over, I think I'll
spend a few days in renaissance Tuscany. There's a little inn outside
Siena I've been wanting to try. <br>
TUVOK: I will join you for a glass of wine. </font></p>

[Holodeck two - da Vinci programme]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (The life study class is still in progress. The EMH and Seven go up into the gallery.)<br>EMH:
How many? <br>
SEVEN: I've observed fifty six of the aliens. There could be more. <br>
EMH: Have you seen any pattern to their behaviour? Any hint as to what
they're trying to accomplish? <br>
SEVEN: They seem to be conducting experiments on the crew and
monitoring the results. <br>
EMH: As if Voyager were one big petri dish. <br>
SEVEN: I may be among them. In the turbolift one of them probed me with
a medical instrument. <br>
EMH: We cannot allow them to continue. <br>
SEVEN: I've been analysing their energy signatures. I believe there's a
way to make them visible to everyone. <br>
EMH: How? <br>
SEVEN: Using a precisely modulated phaser beam. If we expose them the
crew may be able to fight back. <br>
EMH: But what if the aliens retaliate by inflicting lethal mutations on
everyone? It's too risky. <br>
SEVEN: What do you suggest? <br>
EMH: The key to the aliens' control is the genetic tags. I believe a
neuraleptic shock would disable them. Unfortunately, it would be rather
painful. <br>
SEVEN: Will the crew recover? <br>
EMH: Yes, they will. The hard part will be administering the shock to
everyone simultaneously. <br>
SEVEN: The power relays could be reconfigured to do it. <br>
EMH: Good. I assume you know how to do that? <br>
SEVEN: You assume correctly. But I will have to bypass several
safeguards. It will take time. <br>
EMH: Then you'd better get started.<br>(Seven goes to Engineering and does so. One monitor displays Safety Protocol Override command code&nbsp;HB-88.) </font></p>

TUVOK: You're attempting to deceive me. Why? <br>(Three aliens come to listen to them.)<br>
SEVEN: (sotto) I can't explain what I'm doing but you must allow me to
continue. <br>
TUVOK: Your actions could result in an energy discharge which would be
harmful to the crew. <br>
SEVEN: I realise that. <br>(One
of the aliens steps forward. Seven pushes Tuvok aside, grabbing his
phaser. She adjusts it and fires at the alien, bringing him into normal
view. Then she takes her as a shield and points the phaser at the other
two aliens.)<br>SEVEN: Don't move. If your people attempt to
incapacitate me I will kill you. <br>

ready. <br>
SEVEN: Understood. <br>
TUVOK: I'ill attempt to modify the internal sensors to detect the
aliens. <br>
JANEWAY: Good. Keep me informed. (Tuvok and Seven leave.)<br>JANEWAY: Who are you? And what the hell are you
doing to my crew? <br>
ALZEN: My team has been observing you and conducting tests. <br>
JANEWAY: Tests? I'd call them mutilations. <br>
ALZEN: I can understand why you're angry. I don't like causing people
to suffer, but sometimes it's a necessary part of my work. <br>
JANEWAY: What kind of work is that? <br>
ALZEN: Medical research. We're scientists, like you. <br>
JANEWAY: From where I stand you're a hostile invasion force. I want to
know how long you've been here and exactly what you've been doing to
us. <br>
ALZEN: I can't answer those questions. It's a breach of protocol for me
to be speaking to you at all. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, how convenient. That way you never have to face your
victims. <br>
ALZEN: Captain, please. You're exaggerating the situation. Our
techniques are as benign as we can make them. <br>
JANEWAY: What I've been through for the last few days certainly hasn't
felt benign. <br>
ALZEN: Please understand that there's a purpose to our actions. The
data we gather from you may help us cure physical and psychological
disorders that afflict millions. Isn't that worth some discomfort? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sure you'd see things differently if your people were the
ones being subjected to these experiments. <br>
ALZEN: Just as your perspective would change if your people were the
ones to live longer and healthier lives as a result. Don't forget,
we've been observing you, Captain. I know the most important thing to
you is the welfare of your crew. You'd even kill to protect them. <br>
JANEWAY: If necessary. <br>
ALZEN: Of course you would. You take care of your own, just as we do.
We're really more similar than you care to admit. <br>
JANEWAY: That's where you're wrong. <br>(Janeway lowers the forcefield and steps into the cell.)<br>JANEWAY: What you're doing isn't
self-defence. It's the exploitation of another species for your own
benefit. My people decided a long time ago that that was unacceptable,
even in the name of scientific progress. <br>
ALZEN: You're a remarkably strong-willed individual. I've been very
impressed by your self-control over the past several weeks. We've been
increasing your dopamine levels, stimulating various aggressive
impulses to test your behavioural restraints. There's been a great
difference of opinion about how much more strain you can bear. <br>(Janeway slams Alzen against the wall.)<br>
JANEWAY: Not much. <br>
ALZEN: I'd hoped you'd be more cooperative once you realised the
importance of our work. <br>
JANEWAY: Sorry. These lab rats are fighting back. <br>
ALZEN: I'm afraid that would be pointless. We're monitoring your
attempts to break our control over you. You won't succeed. <br>
JANEWAY: You may find that you've underestimated us. <br>
ALZEN: Consider what's in the best interests of your crew. We will be
continuing our research. If you make no further attempts to interfere,
I assure you that the fatality rate will be minimal, though there may
be some deformities. And I would be willing to share our final data
with you. <br>
JANEWAY: You can't possibly expect me to accept that. <br>
ALZEN: If you don't, then the entire experiment and its subjects will
be terminated. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Are you telling me there is no way to disable the tags? <br>
SEVEN: My attempts to use the EPS relays to induce neuraleptic shock
have failed. The aliens may be responsible. <br>
TUVOK: I've encountered similar difficulties in my efforts to modify
the internal sensors. They appear to have gained access to our key
systems. <br>
JANEWAY: They can't be everywhere all the time. We have got to find an
advantage. <br>
EMH: We'd better find one soon. Sickbay is being filled with new
patients with increasingly severe symptoms. <br>
SEVEN: We have the ability to make them visible. If we could modify
enough sensors we could resist them. <br>
TUVOK: They are capable of manipulating our DNA. A direct conflict
would be inadvisable. <br>

She's in hypertensive shock. Twenty milligrams lectrazine. Her blood
pressure is three sixty over one twenty five. <br>
JANEWAY: How is that possible? <br>
EMH: Severe adrenal stress. No effect. <br>(The crewwoman stops convulsing.)<br>EMH: Her arterial pathways are
rupturing. She's in cardiac arrest. We're losing her.<br>(Janeway tries CPR.)<br>EMH: Captain, I'm
afraid that won't help. There's too much internal bleeding. <br>
JANEWAY: Then try something else. We'll transport her to Sickbay. <br>
EMH: Her entire circulatory system has collapsed. There's no way to
repair that kind of damage. Brain death has occurred. I'm sorry, there
was nothing more we could have done. <br>
JANEWAY: This ends right now. (to helmswoman) You're relieved. <br>
TUVOK: Captain, what are you doing? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm running a little experiment of my own. Red alert! <br>(She flies Voyager towards the twin pulsars.)<br>
SEVEN: Captain, one of the aliens has entered the bridge. <br>
JANEWAY: Understood. <br>
TUVOK: We're less than a million kilometres from the pulsars. We must
change course immediately to avoid being caught in their gravity. <br>
JANEWAY: No. Keep going. <br>
TUVOK: This is a far more reckless course of action than I've come to
expect from you, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: It certainly is. <br>
TUVOK: Hull stress is at thirty teradynes and rising. <br>
KIM: I'm transferring more power to the structural integrity field, but
I don't know how long it can hold. <br>(An alien female becomes visible.)<br>
TAKAR: What do you hope to accomplish by this? <br>
JANEWAY: Flying into a binary pulsar? It seems like I'm trying to crush
this ship like a tin can. <br>
TAKAR: It's more likely that you're trying to intimidate us. <br>
JANEWAY: You're welcome to stick around and find out. <br>
TUVOK: Hull stress is at forty five teradynes. <br>(Takar tries to use the helm controls.)<br>
JANEWAY: Our course is locked in. Only my authorisation can release it.
<br>
TAKAR: You're not behaving very rationally. <br>
JANEWAY: That's what you are trying to accomplish, wasn't it? Hmm?
Pumping up my dopamine levels to push me to the edge? Keeping me awake
for four days straight with the constant pain of your devices drilling
into my skull? Well, this is the culmination of your work, and guess
what? You're going to be right here to collect the final data. <br>
KIM: Shields have failed. Structural integrity is down to twenty
percent. <br>
TAKAR: Enter the authorisation code and change course immediately. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't think you realise that you are not in control here
anymore. <br>
TAKAR: I can kill you and your crew in an instant. <br>
JANEWAY: Go ahead. Without us, you won't be able to prevent this ship
from being torn apart by the pulsars. And even with my crew working
together, I'd say the odds of us getting through this are, what, one in
ten? <br>
TUVOK: One in twenty at best, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm willing to take that chance. Are you? <br>(Takar disappears.)<br>
TUVOK: Outer hull temperature has reached nine thousand degrees. <br>
KIM: The hull is beginning to buckle. <br>
SEVEN: Two alien vessels are attempting to disengage from Voyager. <br>(One makes it, the other is ripped apart by the pulsar's gravity.)<br>
JANEWAY: I can't break us free of the gravitational forces.<br>
KIM: Then let's divert all power to the shields. <br>
JANEWAY: No. If we go in, we go in full throttle. <br>
KIM: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: Assuming we survive we'll need all the momentum we can get to
reach escape velocity on the other side. Everyone hang on. I hope you
were exaggerating about those odds, Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: I was not. Hull stress has exceeded maximum tolerance. <br>(Things start to go bang.)<br>
SEVEN: There are breaches on decks four, seven, eight and twelve. <br>
KIM: Emergency forcefields are holding. <br>
JANEWAY: I've lost helm control. <br>
TUVOK: Main power is offline. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, let's hope we've got enough speed.<br>(Voyager whooshes out the other side and into clear space.)<br>
KIM: I don't believe it. We're alive. <br>

TORRES: You're right, they could have. And we don't know how long they
were on board. They could have been tampering with us for months. <br>
PARIS: Well, when you think about it you did have a pretty abrupt
change of heart a couple of weeks ago. What made you realise that you
love me all of a sudden? <br>
TORRES: Just a feeling. So our whole relationship might be based on
some alien experiment. <br>
PARIS: You never know. <br>
