Zeeesh. Alert, alert, decompression on platform six eight four. Brace
for hull rupture. Thrusters are down. We're going to crash! Ahhh. Hey,
what do you think? Look at the detail on the dorsal plating. <br>
FESEK: Impressive. Are you sure you're willing to part with it? <br>
PELK: I just hope your boy enjoys it as much as I do. <br>
FESEK: I'm certain he will, if we make it home in time for his
birthday. <br>
PELK: We'll make it. <br>
FESEK: If you and Savar had a child of your own, you'd have an excuse to
play with toys more often. <br>(Rumble, alarm.)<br>
PELK: I'm detecting a fluctuation in tank four. There's a full scale
rupture in progress. <br>
FESEK: Isolate the deck. Activate the emergency containment field. <br>
PELK: The emergency systems are offline. <br>
FESEK: Backup controls are down too. Eject the tank. <br>
PELK: Here? There's an inhabited system. <br>
FESEK: We have no choice! <br>
PELK: The ejection ports aren't responding. <br>
FESEK: Impossible.<br>
DREMK: There's another rupture forming in tank six. <br>
FESEK: We'll have to send somebody down there to seal off the tanks
manually. Contact the theta core. <br>
PELK: Communications are down. <br>
FESEK: Get down to the injector pod and seal those tanks. <br>
DREMK: I didn't sign up for core labour. <br>

quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Tuvok is giving a lesson in meditation.)<br>TUVOK:
The flame, like emotion, is a primitive force. Left unchecked, it's
chaotic, destructive. But if controlled it can be a powerful tool. The
lamp controls the flame, as you must learn to control your emotions. <br>
TORRES: I lost my temper. No big deal. <br>
TUVOK: You destroyed the Doctor's holographic camera. <br>
TORRES: I told him three times to leave Engineering, but he kept
buzzing around snapping pictures for some photo essay. <br>
TUVOK: A day in the life of the warp core. <br>
TORRES: I apologised, and I replicated him a new camera. <br>
TUVOK: You have a long history of emotional volatility. The point of
this exercise is not to atone for past transgressions, but to prevent
future ones. <br>
TORRES: You can't order someone to meditate. <br>
TUVOK: Commander Chakotay thinks otherwise. <br>(Torres kneels opposite Tuvok.)<br>
TORRES: Are my eyes supposed to be open or closed for this part. <br>
TUVOK: Whichever allows you to focus your mind. <br>(She closes them.)<br>TUVOK: Envision the flame
burning within you. <br>(Torres laughs.)<br>
TORRES: Sorry. <br>
TUVOK: The flame grows hotter. A point of white light. Follow it
backward through the years to a time when you were younger, a child. Is
there something amusing, Lieutenant? <br>
TORRES: I'm sorry, an image just flashed through my mind. You as a
child, those pointy little ears. You must have been cute. <br>
TUVOK: Indeed. Please follow my instructions or we'll discontinue this
exercise. <br>
TORRES: Right. Me, childhood. How old? <br>
TUVOK: Your earliest memories. Try to recall a time when you
experienced uncontrollable anger. <br>
TORRES: Daniel Byrd. <br>
TUVOK: I beg your pardon? <br>
TORRES: He was one of my classmates in grammar school. He was always
terrorising me. He used to point at my cranial ridges and tease me
about being half Klingon. He called me Miss Turtlehead. <br>
TUVOK: That angered you. <br>
TORRES: Of course, it did. So I attacked him once, during recess, on
the gyro-swing. I disengaged the centrifugal governor. He was spinning
so fast, he almost flew apart. Then I yanked him off the swing and
started pounding his little face! If Miss Malvin hadn't showed up, I
probably would have <br>
TUVOK: Describe the anger you felt at that moment. <br>
TORRES: I, I wanted to hurt him. To take revenge for all the
humiliation he caused me. <br>
TUVOK: Your anger was a source of strength. It protected you, gave you
courage. <br>
TORRES: I suppose it did. <br>
TUVOK: And when the Doctor tried to take a holo-photograph of you? <br>
TORRES: I was annoyed. He kept getting in the way. <br>
TUVOK: The rage within you runs deep. It's been with you for many
years. <br>
TORRES: I'm not a Vulcan. I'll survive. <br>
TUVOK: Whatever you say, Miss Turtlehead. <br>
TORRES: What did you say! <br>
TUVOK: You're easily provoked. You must learn to master your emotions. <br>
TORRES: I've had enough mastery for one day. School's out.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
So, how'd it go with B'Elanna today? <br>
TUVOK: Our meditation sessions are confidential. <br>
PARIS: No, I'm not asking for sordid details. I just want to know if
you think you can help her. <br>
TUVOK: Her training will be a challenge for both of us. <br>
PARIS: Take it from me, getting B'Elanna to control her temper is like
convincing a Ferengi to leave his estate to charity. <br>
KIM: Captain, we're receiving an automated distress call. <br>
JANEWAY: Origin? <br>
KIM: Coordinates one twenty one by two six eight. Range, two billion
kilometres. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Who's sending it? <br>
KIM: I can't tell. <br>
JANEWAY: Let them know help's on the way. Set a course, Mister Paris. <br>(Later, they arrive at the coordinates.)<br>TUVOK:
Thirty seven escape pods. <br>
PARIS: They're contaminated with theta radiation. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Malon? <br>
JANEWAY: Possibly. Lifesigns? <br>
KIM: Two, but they're erratic. <br>
JANEWAY: Beam them to Sickbay. Initiate bio-hazard containment
procedures. <br>
TUVOK: Theta radiation has affected a radius of six hundred million
kilometres. <br>
JANEWAY: Source? <br>
TUVOK: A Malon freighter travelling at high impulse. It appears to be
abandoned. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TUVOK: I
thought we'd seen the last of the Malon. <br>
JANEWAY: I guess they're looking for new places to dump their toxic
waste. <br>
EMH: Do we know what happened to their ship? Were they attacked? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm just as curious as you are. Can you revive either of them?
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway. <br>
FESEK: Fesek. Controller Fesek. Where am I? <br>
JANEWAY: You're on my vessel. We responded to your distress call. <br>
FESEK: My ship? <br>
JANEWAY: It's heavily damaged. <br>
FESEK: Where? <br>
TUVOK: Three million kilometres from here. <br>
FESEK: That's too close. We've got to get further away. <br>
JANEWAY: Calm down, calm down. Tell me what's wrong with your ship. Why
did you abandon it? <br>
FESEK: We were on a waste export mission. <br>
TUVOK: Dumping theta radiation. <br>
FESEK: Two of the theta tanks ruptured. Systems malfunctioned one by
one, communications, navigation, propulsion. We had no choice.
Radiation was venting from every port. Over sixty crewmen died within
minutes. It was chaos. We stumbled through the gas to get to the escape
pods. Only a few of us made it. Where are the others? <br>
JANEWAY: The two of you were the only ones we found alive. <br>
FESEK: Listen to me very carefully. The fact that we're still here
means the ship hasn't exploded, yet. When it does, over four trillion
isotons of antimatter waste is going to ignite. Everything within
three light years will be destroyed. <br>
JANEWAY: Janeway to the bridge. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Go ahead. <br>
JANEWAY: Put at least five light years between us and the Malon
freighter.

[OC]: Evacuate immediately. <br>
PARIS: Our warp field just collapsed. <br>
KIM :All this theta radiation. It's disrupting subspace. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Can you reinitialise the field? <br>
TORRES: Negative. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Tuvok. Without warp drive there's no chance we'll clear the blast
radius. <br>
TUVOK: Agreed. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Paris, set a course for the freighter. Full impulse. <br>
PARIS [OC]: Aye, Captain. <br>
FESEK: What? <br>
JANEWAY: If we can't outrun your ship, maybe we can disable it. <br>
FESEK: Every deck has been contaminated. Anyone who goes on board will
liquefy within minutes. <br>
JANEWAY: We'll find a way. <br>
FESEK: We? I'm not going anywhere near that vessel. <br>
JANEWAY: You can either stay and help us or I'll send you back to your
escape pod. Your choice. Clean them up, Doctor. I need them on the bridge.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(They catch up with the freighter.)<br>JANEWAY:
How long until those storage tanks explode? <br>
TORRES: Approximately six hours. <br>
JANEWAY: Can we get an away team on board? <br>
TUVOK: The freighter's hull is intact. Life support appears to be
operational. However, thirty three of forty two decks are flooded with
high levels of theta radiation. <br>
FESEK: Including the control room, which is where we'd have to go to
reestablish containment. As I told you. <br>
TORRES: We could beam on to one of the lower levels where there's less
radiation, and vent the contaminated sections one by one. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Clear a path to the control room. <br>
FESEK: I appreciate what you're trying to do, but if what you're
considering were possible, we'd have tried it before we abandoned the
ship. We have years of experience aboard freighters of this gradient. <br>
TORRES: Your experience is what got us into this mess in the first
place. <br>
JANEWAY: That's enough, Lieutenant. <br>
FESEK: Maybe there's another way. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm listening. <br>
FESEK: Four hours from here there's a nebula that could protect us from
the blast. We could alter course, wait there until after the explosion.
<br>
JANEWAY: There are at least three other ships in the sector. What about
them? <br>
FESEK: I don't see what we can do. <br>
TORRES: So hundreds of people become contaminated because you're not
willing to clean up your garbage. <br>
JANEWAY: Lieutenant. Assemble an away team. We're going over there. <br>
PELK: Wait! Tell them about the Vihaar. <br>
JANEWAY: What's he talking about? <br>
FESEK: Nothing. It's a myth. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What kind of myth? <br>
FESEK: It's an old story shared among freighter crews. Some of them say
they've seen creatures in the theta storage tanks. <br>
TORRES: Creatures? <br>
FESEK: Created by radiogenic waste. According to the legend, they are
poisonous monsters that wreak havoc aboard Malon ships. It's a common
belief among our more superstitious
recruits. <br>
PELK: I never believed it myself, but during the evacuation some of the
crew people saw something. A form. <br>
FESEK: Hallucinations are one of the first symptoms of theta poisoning.
You know that. <br>
PELK: Maybe. Then how do you explain what happened? We checked every
system. <br>
TORRES: You'd say anything to get out of going back to that freighter. <br>
PELK: If you'd been there, you'd be afraid to go back, too.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CHAKOTAY:
This chamber seems to be the least affected by radiation. We'll beam in
there. <br>
PELK: That's fifteen decks below the control room. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We'll have to work our way up. <br>
FESEK: The pressurisation systems, they're offline. How will we vent
the gas? <br>
NEELIX: There are two main airlocks on each deck. We'll open them as we
go. Perform a series of controlled decompressions. <br>
PELK: What's to stop us from being vented? <br>
NEELIX: Forcefields. I spent six years aboard a Talaxian garbage scow.
I know a few things about waste management. <br>
PELK: Even low levels of theta radiation can be lethal. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Our Doctor's developed an inoculation. It'll temporarily
prevent our cells from absorbing the radiation. <br>
FESEK: How long will it last? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Two, three hours. <br>
PELK: Half of the doors and bulkheads are fused. The ascenders are
offline. It could take us twice as long as that to reach the control
room. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Then we'll have to work quickly. We'll take phasers to cut
through any obstacles. <br>
FESEK: I've ordered my men to do a lot of risky things, but nothing as
foolish as this. <br>
TORRES: More foolish than towing around a trillion isotons of toxic
waste? <br>
FESEK: We take every precaution to keep it contained. <br>
TORRES: Until you dump it in someone's back yard. <br>
FESEK: Is your crew always so diplomatic? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Your concerns are noted. Get them inoculated. We'll meet you
in Transporter room one. <br>(Neelix and the Malons leave.)<br>CHAKOTAY: We're trying to avoid explosions, remember? <br>
TORRES: Oh! Not another lecture about my emotions. <br>
CHAKOTAY: No, a lecture about how to treat guests aboard this ship. <br>
TORRES: Guests? Chakotay, these people are the scourge of the quadrant.
<br>
CHAKOTAY: Agreed, but right now they're our only hope of repairing that
freighter, so I suggest you make friends. <br>
TORRES: Diplomacy. Janeway's answer to everything. <br>
CHAKOTAY: This isn't the Captain talking, it's me, and I'm giving you
an order. Keep your temper in check. Understood? Understood? <br>
TORRES: Yeah. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I didn't hear you. <br>
TORRES: Yes. <br>
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna, I need your expertise on this mission, not your bad
mood. <br>
TORRES: I'll see what I can do.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Neelix is making a thick soup. He has to force himself to taste it.)<br>CHAKOTAY:
Ready, Neelix? <br>
NEELIX: Ah, not quite. Do we still have a minute? It's just it's not
quite strong enough yet. Would you mind passing me that little
dish? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Neelix, I admire your dedication, but the crew can figure out
lunch on their own. <br>
NEELIX: Lunch, and dinner, and a midnight snack have all been taken
care of. This is for me. It's a Talaxian theta radiation remedy.
Crushed rama leaf and katyllian clove. It helps fortify the cellular
membranes. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I think the Doctor's inoculation might be a better way to go.
<br>
NEELIX: Every little bit helps. Oh, by the way, thank you. <br>
CHAKOTAY: For what? <br>
NEELIX: For sending me on such an important mission. Not that my duties
in the mess hall aren't challenging. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It was an easy choice. You were the best man for the job. <br>
NEELIX: Well, our scow once ran smack into a theta radiation field.
Knocked the propulsion out. We had no choice but to sit there. We were
barely alive when they found us. If it hadn't been for this, nobody
would have survived. <br>(He forces himself to take another mouthful.)<br>NEELIX: Once you get past the choking reflex it's really
not so bad. Want to try some? <br>

FESEK: Have you ever been to Malon Prime? It's a remarkable place. It's
one of the most beautiful worlds you'll ever see. Our planet would
choke with industrial wastes if it weren't for the sacrifices of people
like me. <br>
TORRES: How many worlds are you willing to contaminate to keep your own
home so tidy? <br>

areas? Ah, manual actuators. I'll release them, you monitor the
pressure variance. <br>

This is the infirmary? It looks more like a morgue. What happened to him? <br>
FESEK: It looks like he was being treated for long term exposure. He
was probably left behind during the evacuation. <br>
TORRES: Tough luck, huh? <br>
FESEK: There was nothing more we could do for him. He was a core
labourer. <br>
TORRES: Meaning? <br>
FESEK: He worked close to the storage tanks. Only three of ten core
labourers survive a standard mission. <br>
TORRES: Occupational hazard? <br>
FESEK: They know the risks when they accept the assignment. <br>
TORRES: They know they're going to end up like this? <br>
FESEK: Core labourers can make more in two months than most Malon make
in a lifetime. <br>
TORRES: What good is the money if they're not around to collect it. <br>
FESEK: It will go to his family. <br>
TORRES: What is that thing? <br>
FESEK: It's a subdermal injector. It contains analeptic compounds to
reverse the cell damage. <br>
TORRES: I feel better already. <br>

slight burning sensation. <br>(Fesek plunges the two large needles into Torres' neck.)

Commander. The Captain's plan B. I've calculated the inertial force
required to divert the freighter. Plan C. Shield modulations that
should reduce the structural damage of Voyager. It will also help
protect the crew against theta radiation poisoning, if we fail. <br>
TUVOK: A wise precaution. With any luck, we won't be needing it. <br>
SEVEN: I didn't think Vulcans believed in luck. <br>
TUVOK: As a rule we don't, but serving with Captain Janeway has taught
me otherwise. <br>

allow. I'll factor it into my calculations. <br>
