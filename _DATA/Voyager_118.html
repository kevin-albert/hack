JANEWAY: Happy birthday, Kes.<br>
NEELIX: Imagine, two years old today. If you ask me, you don't look a
day over one.<br>
KES: Why was everyone hiding?<br>
PARIS: Oh, it's an old Earth custom called a surprise party.<br>
JANEWAY: Sorry if we startled you.<br>

SANDRINE: My new bartender. Handsome, isn't he?<br>
EMH: I'm here in an official capacity, of course. In case of a medical

KIM: And I've recalibrated the accelerometer relays.<br>
TUVOK: Acknowledged.<br>
KIM: Is there anything else I can do for you, sir?<br>
TUVOK: I presume this notable impatience is due to your desire to
attend the festivities in Holodeck two.<br>
KIM: Yes, sir.<br>
TUVOK: May I remind you that your duty shift does not officially
terminate for another thirty four minutes? However, I believe the
holodeck power conduits would benefit from a routine inspection.<br>

TUVOK [OC]: Bridge to Janeway.<br>
JANEWAY: Go ahead, Lieutenant.<br>
TUVOK [OC]: Captain, we have encountered an unusual phenomenon.
Phenomenon. Phenomenon. Phenomenon. Phenomenon. Phenomenon. Phenomenon.
Phenomenon. Phenomenon. Phenomenon. Phenomenon. Phenomenon.<br>
(Tuvok's voice continues to echo around the holodeck.) <br>
JANEWAY: What is going on, Lieutenant?<br>
TORRES: It might simply be a localised malfunction, but I've never
heard anything like it. My guess is <br>
(Peace is restored.) <br>
TORRES: It's a problem with the comm. system itself.<br>
JANEWAY: Janeway to Bridge. Get down to Engineering and run a
diagnostic. I'm afraid we're going to have to cut your party short,
Kes. Stations, everyone. Let's move.<br>

JANEWAY: Save me a slice, won't you? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
These readings indicate the space ahead of us is literally changing
shape. My best guess is it's some type of spatial distortion wave.<br>
TUVOK: Is the anomaly responsible for the comm. system malfunction?<br>
KIM: I think so. It's generating intense pulses of EM radiation, and if
we don't get out of its way, it's going to intercept us in less than
ten minutes.<br>
TUVOK: Acknowledged. Full reverse, Ensign.<br>
CREWWOMAN: Aye, sir.<br>
KIM: We can't go backwards either, Mister Tuvok. The distortion has
completely surrounded us like a ring.<br>
TUVOK: If we can not go around it, then we will have to go through it.<br>
KIM: There's no telling what that will do to the ship.<br>
TUVOK: From what you have told me, Ensign, the distortion ring will
make contact with us momentarily whether we attempt to pass through it
or not. I prefer to minimise the amount of time that contact lasts.
Shields at maximum. Warp three. Engage.<br>
KIM: The distortion ring has collapsed the warp field. Engines are
offline.<br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> BAXTER:
Ensign Kim, I've been trying to report a problem in the gym, but the
comm. system seems to be down.<br>
KIM: We've encountered a spatial distortion. It's knocked out several
systems.<br>
BAXTER: Maybe that explains why the gym got so cold.<br>
KIM: Cold?<br>
BAXTER: I didn't notice it at first. I was working out so hard. Then I
realised it was under ten degrees C. The environmental controls didn't
respond to my commands and neither did the comm. system.<br>
KIM: Engines are offline too. I'm looking for the Captain to let her
know what's going on.<br>
BAXTER: Should I report to my duty station?<br>
KIM: It might not be a bad idea. Until we find out exactly what's going
on, everybody should be on standby.<br>

JANEWAY: The first thing I want to do when we get to the Bridge is
establish a remote comm. link to Engineering. I want to know exactly
what's going on.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Where are we?<br>
PARIS: Deck four.<br>
CHAKOTAY: If the comm. system's malfunctioning, the computer could be
misreading our voice commands.<br>
PARIS: That might explain why it took us here instead of the Bridge.<br>

Did you enjoy your first surprise party, sweeting?<br>
KES: It was wonderful. Thank you.<br>
NEELIX: I thought you'd like it. The cake, the presents. What was your
favourite part?<br>
KES: I suppose what I liked best was that all my friends were there.<br>
NEELIX: Ah, that was nice, wasn't it? And don't forget that beautiful
necklace Tom Paris gave you.<br>
KES: Do you really like it?<br>
NEELIX: Oh, why wouldn't I like it? Paris obviously has excellent taste.<br>
KES: I was afraid you might be a little jealous.<br>
NEELIX: Who, me? Don't be silly.<br>
KES: Are you sure?<br>
NEELIX: You, my dearest, have seen the last of that green-eyed pus hog
called jealousy.<br>
KES: I'm glad.<br>
NEELIX: Of course, Paris did replicate that locket, whereas I baked the
Jibelian fudge cake from scratch.<br>

TORRES: And I'm trying to get to Engineering.<br>
BAXTER: I can't find the cargo bay, and I can't find my security team.
I've been wandering around for about ten minutes.<br>
TORRES: Well, at least I know I'm not crazy. Unless we both are.<br>
BAXTER: No, something very strange is going on. Ensign Kim said we'd
encountered a spatial distortion.<br>
TORRES: Did he say what kind?<br>
BAXTER: No, he went to find the Captain.<br>
TORRES: The Captain is on her way to the Bridge. But if she's having
the same trouble we are, who knows if she can get there. I'm going to
keep trying to get to Engineering.<br>

EMH: The Captain and the others went to investigate the phenomenon
Mister Tuvok reported.<br>
KIM: So all of you heard his report before the comm. system failed?<br>
EMH: Only a fraction of it.<br>
KIM: Well, I'm sure Tuvok's filled them in with the rest by now. What
are you still doing on the holodeck, besides playing doctor, that is?<br>
EMH: For your information, I have been attempting to transfer myself
back to Sickbay. But each time I try, I reappear here.<br>
KIM: That's strange.<br>
EMH: Not to mention extremely irritating. I can't seem to shut down
Mister Paris's holoprogram either.<br>
KIM: Computer, end holodeck programme Paris Three. Computer, arch.
Either the holoemitters are malfunctioning or the computer's not
accepting voice commands. I'm sorry, Doctor. I don't have time to help
you right now.<br>
EMH: Wait just a minute.<br>
KIM: Hmm?<br>
EMH: What do you think you're going.<br>
KIM: I've got to get back to the Bridge. We're in the middle of a
crisis.<br>
EMH: All the more reason I should be back in Sickbay. I'm sure that the

Maybe you can help us. I know you'll find this hard to believe, but we
can't seem to find Kes's quarters.<br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (The
bar is an impromptu briefing room, with Gaunt Gary playing pool and an
accordion player making music in the background.) <br>
JANEWAY: Let me get this straight. This distortion ring has completely
immobilised us. We have no means of communication with the Bridge or
any other part of the ship. And no matter where any of us have tried to
go, the Bridge, Engineering, Kes's quarters, we've all eventually ended
up here right back at deck six.<br>
KIM: The bridge is on deck one. Engineering is on deck eleven. deck six
is halfway in between, right?<br>
CHAKOTAY: So?<br>
KIM: So if we're being surrounded by this ring, maybe it's pushing us
all to the centre of the ship.<br>
TORRES: But it's not just that we're being led back here. I mean, rooms
are in the wrong place. Is it possible that this distortion ring is
somehow changing the layout of the ship?<br>
EMH: There is another possibility. Exposure to some types of EM
radiation has been known to cause hallucinations. Perhaps it's not the
ship that's undergone changes but rather your perception of it.
Unfortunately, without my medical equipment to analyse your optic
nerves, there's no way to tell.<br>
JANEWAY: We'll never figure it out sitting here. We need more
information about this phenomenon. Sensor readings, computer analyses.
We have to find a way back to the Bridge.<br>
TORRES: If we can't get back on foot or on the turbolift, maybe we can
rig a site to site transport. Beam ourselves to the Bridge.<br>
CHAKOTAY: We'd have to get to a transporter room first.<br>
TORRES: Or to Engineering, wherever that is.<br>
PARIS: When we tried to go to the Bridge, one of the places the
turbolift took us was Engineering. Maybe if we repeated our steps,
it'll take us back there.<br>
JANEWAY: It's worth a shot. Lieutenant Paris, you're with Torres.<br>
KIM: Maybe we can get to the Bridge through a Jefferies tube. If I
remember my ship specs correctly, there should be an emergency access
conduit which leads directly from this deck to deck one right behind
the Bridge.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'd like to keep trying to get to the Bridge on foot. If the
ship has been reconfigured somehow, I can get a deck by deck picture of
what it looks like as I go.<br>
PARIS: What's going to keep you from getting lost?<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'll get a tricorder from the storage locker, rig it to emit
a photoplasmic trail.<br>
JANEWAY: Right. We should all get tricorders. Set them on active scan.
Gather as much information as we can about what's happening to the ship.<br>
EMH: May I request that Kes be allowed to stay here with me? Beside
helping stave off the predatory advances of that woman, she may be able
to help me find a way to transfer myself back to Sickbay.<br>
NEELIX: And, er, I'll assist Commander Chakotay, Captain. As you may
have heard, my tracking skills are legendary throughout the quadrant.<br>
JANEWAY: That all right with you, Commander? Mister Kim, I'm with you.

NEELIX: You have?<br>
CHAKOTAY: I imagine most people who've been in love have been jealous
at one time or another.<br>
NEELIX: I see. It's a perfectly normal response. Then why, why is it so
unpleasant?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Jealousy's about the fear of losing someone we love. There's
no pain greater than that. Neelix, are you afraid you're going to lose
Kes to someone?<br>
NEELIX: No. I mean, I don't think so. At least I certainly hope not. I
just can't seem to stop these awful feelings.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Nothing makes us more vulnerable than when we love someone.
We can be hurt very easily. But I've always believed that what you get
when you love someone is greater than what you risk.<br>
BAXTER: Commander, am I ever glad to see you. Do you have any idea
what's going on here?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Not exactly.<br>
BAXTER: Well, I feel like I've been wandering around for hours. I can't
find the cargo bay.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Have you seen anyone else? Any more of the crew?<br>
BAXTER: Some people roaming around like me. A couple of times I wound
up in the Mess Hall. There were quite a few people there.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I suggest you make your way back. Tell everyone you run into
to come with you, and all of you stay put in the Mess Hall. When we
figure out what's going on, we'll let you know.<br>

TUVOK: That is an interesting question, Commander. I am not certain how
I arrived at this location.<br>
CHAKOTAY: You're lost too.<br>
TUVOK: Indeed. When I received no word from you or the Captain, I left
Lieutenant Ayala in command and came to look for you myself.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Can you lead us back to the Bridge?<br>
TUVOK: I do not believe so. When I first realised I was lost, I
attempted to retrace my steps only to find myself here.<br>
CHAKOTAY: None of us has been able to reach the Bridge. In fact, Neelix
and I can't seem to get off deck six.<br>
TUVOK: Strange, I thought we were on deck three.<br>
CHAKOTAY: What was our status when you left the Bridge?<br>
TUVOK: The ring has penetrated our shields and is now in direct contact
with the hull.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Then maybe it is possible the distortions are somehow
reconfiguring the ship.<br>

I think that's the conduit leading to the Bridge.<br>

(Kim manages to heave her back, then shuts the hatch.) <br>
JANEWAY: I think I'm okay.<br>
KIM: I'm reading an intense electromagnetic charge on the other side of
that hatch. That must have been what was pulling you in.<br>
JANEWAY: It's as if everything on the other side is in a state of
structural flux. The walls, the atmosphere.<br>
KIM: And the sequence of those fluctuations matches the readings from
the distortion ring. This phenomenon isn't just occurring in space.
It's definitely inside the ship as well.<br>

SANDRINE: Ah, trust me, cherie. You are better off without him. All men
are alike. In the end, they always break your heart.<br>
KIM: Can I get some help here?<br>
(Kim carries Janeway in.) <br>
EMH: What happened to her?<br>
KIM: She came into contact with the spatial distortions in the
Jefferies Tube. She seemed fine for a couple of minutes, but then she
started to fade in and out of consciousness. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
I believe we should go this way, Commander.<br>
CHAKOTAY: What makes you say that?<br>
TUVOK: If we are indeed trapped in some sort of labyrinth, then the
logical course is to systematically eliminate all routes which do not
lead us to our desired destination. The route that remains will be the
correct one. Since we have been making a series of right turns, we
should continue to do so, until we are certain this path is not the
proper one.<br>
CHAKOTAY: There's a flaw in your logic.<br>
TUVOK: How so, Commander?<br>
CHAKOTAY: You're assuming there's a logical pattern to this maze we're
caught in, but so far I haven't seen any evidence of that.<br>
TUVOK: Even within chaotic systems, there is a pattern of limited
predictability.<br>
CHAKOTAY: By the time we figure that pattern out, these distortions may
have completely overrun the ship.<br>
TUVOK: That is a possibility.<br>
CHAKOTAY: The important thing is for at least one of us to make it back
to the Bridge. So why don't you go your way and I'll go mine? That way
we'll increase the chances that one of us will be successful.<br>
TUVOK: As you wish, Commander.<br>
(They head in opposite directions, and meet again at the next
intersection.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tell me something, Tuvok. What does your logic tell you about
navigating a maze that's constantly changing shape? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PARIS:
Scanners check out.<br>
TORRES: Then we're ready to give it a try. Activate the auxiliary
pattern buffers.<br>
PARIS: Pattern buffers activated.<br>
TORRES: Targeting the Bridge coordinates. Scanners locked. Energise. </font></p>

and Torres beam onto the pool table. Chakotay and Tuvok are also
there.) <br>
GAUNT GARY: Would you mind moving your foot, Tommy boy? It's blocking
my shot.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Tell me you already made it to the Bridge, and you've come
back here to give us a status report.<br>
TORRES: We locked onto the Bridge coordinates, but this is where we
ended up. None of you had any luck either?<br>
TUVOK: Not only has no one been able to reach the Bridge, but the
Captain came into contact with the spatial distortion and is now
unconscious.<br>
CHAKOTAY: That's not all. We lost Neelix too.<br>
PARIS: Lost him?<br>
CHAKOTAY: He turned a corner, and he was just gone. We think the
spatial distortions are continuously changing the configuration of the
corridors.<br>
TORRES: Kes must be worried sick.<br>
KIM: And it isn't just Neelix who's missing. Where's the rest of the
crew?<br>
TUVOK: It is likely that they too are trapped in other parts of the
ship, cut off from communication and unable to find their way out.<br>
PARIS: So what do we do now?<br>
CHAKOTAY: This wave is obviously causing some kind of radical
reconfiguration of the ship. We've got to try to reverse it. If not, we
may never be able to get to the Bridge.<br>
TORRES: How are we supposed to reverse something we don't understand?
No matter where we go, we end up here. Corridors are realigning. Rooms
are in the wrong place. What's the pattern?<br>
TUVOK: We would certainly benefit from having an accurate picture of
what the ship currently looks like. That way we would have a better
chance of getting where we want to go.<br>
KIM: Maybe we could make a map.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Ensign?<br>
KIM: One good thing about all the wandering we've been doing is that
we've been collecting a lot of tricorder data about the structural
changes that have been taking place.<br>
TORRES: And if we fed all that information into the central database,
the computer might be able to extrapolate a schematic of the ship as
it's configured now.<br>
CHAKOTAY: What are we waiting for? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Outside
the holodeck]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Vessel
status 0553 is on the control panel.) <br>
KIM: The computer has analysed all our tricorder data, so this ought to
be pretty close to what it looks like now.<br>
PARIS: It's as if the entire ship is being compressed and twisted.<br>
TORRES: My guess is it's more than just a distortion ring. It looks
like some sort of spatial implosion that's slowly crushing us.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Look, this part of the ship seems unaffected.<br>
KIM: That's deck six where we are.<br>
TUVOK: Correct, Ensign. However, the area we occupying will not remain
unaffected indefinitely.<br>
CHAKOTAY: How long?<br>
TUVOK: Based on the rate of implosion thus far, I estimate the ring
will crush deck six in approximately sixty eight minutes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Holodeck
- Sandrine's]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PARIS:
Is this implosion ring some kind of weapon? Are we under attack?<br>
KIM: Who'd want to attack us and why?<br>
TUVOK: There is no clear evidence of an intelligence behind the
phenomenon. It is still possible we are dealing with a naturally
occurring anomaly which does not conform to the known laws of physics.<br>
TORRES: Don't you think it's a little late to be speculating on who or
what this thing is? The important thing now is that we find out some
way of stopping it.<br>
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna's right. It seems to me we've got two options. One,
we find a way to get ourselves out of this implosion ring, or two, we
find some way of reversing it.<br>
KIM: Invert the effect. Turn the implosion into an explosion.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Exactly.<br>
TORRES: If I can get back to Engineering, I may be able to generate a
shock pulse strong enough to do just that. Of course, I'd have to raise
the pressure in the warp core to near critical.<br>
KIM: A shock pulse of that magnitude would create a subatomic particle
shower all over the ship.<br>
TUVOK: Which could set off a chain reaction that would cause not only
the ring to explode outward but Voyager along with it.<br>
TORRES: Not if I can precisely tune the shock pulse to the distortion
frequency of the ring.<br>
TUVOK: That would be exceptionally difficult.<br>
TORRES: If we don't give this a try, we're going to get crushed anyway.
Personally, I'd rather go down fighting.<br>
TUVOK: I must remind you that with the comm. system down, we will have
no effective means of alerting the rest of the crew to a potentially
lethal particle shower.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Do you have another suggestion, Mister Tuvok?<br>
TUVOK: I believe it would be safer to attempt to access the
navigational array and from there engage thrusters to steer us out of
the ring.<br>
KIM: Can't we try both?<br>
TORRES: It's much too dangerous to have someone working at the
navigational array during a shock pulse.<br>
PARIS: Besides, this ship is so contorted, there's no reason to expect
we'd have any navigational control.<br>
CHAKOTAY: All right, B'Elanna. Let's give your plan a shot. You <br>
TUVOK: Commander Chakotay?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes, Lieutenant?<br>
TUVOK: I feel compelled to point out that in my many years of
experience as Captain Janeway's tactical officer, she often
demonstrated a tendency to follow my <br>
CHAKOTAY: In case you haven't noticed, Captain Janeway's not in any
condition to make decisions. I'm in command. Is that understood?<br>
TUVOK: Yes, sir.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Good. B'Elanna, you and Harry get down to Engineering.
Evacuate whoever's on duty, then initiate the warp pulse. Move it. </font></p>

should get out of here by the time it hits fifty!<br>

she does.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain! <br>
(Janeway opens her eyes and speaks.) <br>
JANEWAY: Dark. Gan. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What's wrong with her?<br>
EMH: It's possible the spatial distortions have damaged her speech
centre, (Janeway hears gibberish) her neural pathways.<br>
TORRES: Chakotay, it didn't work.<br>
KIM: Instead of forcing the implosion outward, the pulse is drawing it
in at a faster rate.<br>
PARIS: You're saying it made things worse?<br>
KIM: I don't think we have more than a few minutes.<br>
TORRES: Paris, we have to get to the navigational array and give
Tuvok's plan a try.<br>
TUVOK: I'm afraid there's no longer time for that.<br>
TORRES: Why not?<br>
(The distortion is affecting the holodeck.) <br>
PARIS: We're not going anywhere. <br>
(Tuvok scans the encroaching distortion while Torres and Kim work at
the holodeck controls.)<br>
PARIS: Do you really think it's possible to project a stable
holographic force field?<br>
TORRES: We've tried everything else. Ready? Here we go.<br>
(A forcefield appears, flickers and disappears.) <br>
TUVOK: The distortion is unaffected by the force field.<br>
TORRES: We've got to figure out a way to generate a stable field.<br>
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna, this ring has passed through the shields, crushed
the hull, twisted the ship. We'll never get enough power from the
holoemitters to stop it.<br>
TORRES: What are you saying? We're out of options?<br>
TUVOK: Perhaps not. So far, we have been unsuccessful in all our
attempts to either explain or combat this phenomenon. And according to
my calculations, the space we are currently occupying will implode in
approximately three minutes seventeen seconds.<br>
TORRES: You said there was another option.<br>
TUVOK: We do nothing.<br>
TORRES: Excuse me?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Are you suggesting we just let it crush us?<br>
TUVOK: Precisely.<br>
TORRES: I can't believe I'm hearing this from you.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I agree. It sounds completely illogical.<br>
TUVOK: On the contrary. When every logical course of action is
exhausted, the only option that remains is inaction.<br>
TORRES: So we're just supposed to sit here and let this thing kill us?<br>
TUVOK: I must point out that at least one attempt we made to reverse
the effect, the shock pulse, only made our predicament worse. If we
continue desperately improvising solutions, our own efforts may
ultimately kill us. On the other hand, there is no definitive evidence
to suggest that doing nothing will result in death.<br>
JANEWAY: Is dogin do be to gandin! <br>
EMH: Captain, please lie down. <br>
TORRES: What about the Captain? She's dying.<br>
TUVOK: We do not know that. At the moment, she is merely delirious.<br>
TORRES: Chakotay, you're in charge here. Don't you agree we've got to
keep trying?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Whatever this thing is, B'Elanna, it's bigger and more
powerful than we are. Maybe, maybe this is one bear we can't wrestle to
the ground. Maybe like Tuvok says there's nothing we can do but let it
happen, and hope for the best.<br>
TORRES: Fine. Fine, Chakotay. Have it your way.<br>
TUVOK: Commander Chakotay.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes, Mister Tuvok?<br>
TUVOK: I want to thank you for endorsing my recommendation.<br>
CHAKOTAY: You know, Tuvok, I may not get another chance to say this.
Sometimes I find you arrogant and irritating, but you're a hell of an
officer.<br>
TUVOK: Thank you, sir. And since we are speaking candidly, may I say,
sir, that I have not always been particularly partial to your methods
either.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I suppose it must have been tough for you to accept my being
elevated to first officer over you.<br>
TUVOK: I have always respected Captain Janeway's decisions. However, I
suppose that particular decision did put me in a position I am
unaccustomed to. If that ever caused me to make things more difficult
for you, I must apologise.<br>

this. But yeah, I'm afraid.<br>

might be in for another long journey.<br>
TORRES: I guess I could use a little spiritual guidance myself right
now. Mind if I join you?<br>

(Torres sits down, and they hold hands. Paris puts his hand on Kim's
shoulder as the distortion passes through Chakotay and Torres. They are
next. Tuvok nearly touches Janeway as it heads towards him. Shortly
after, everyone is solid again.) <br>

JANEWAY: I'm all right.<br>

JANEWAY: I want a full systems report. And Mister Kim, Mister Tuvok, I
want every iota of information that was recorded regarding that

PARIS: The distortion ring's directly ahead, Captain. It's moving away
from us at two thousand kph.<br>
CHAKOTAY: We've got a full crew complement, Captain. No injuries
reported.<br>
TORRES: No damage to the hull or ship systems.<br>

gigaquads of new information have been input into the ship's computer.<br>
JANEWAY: Where did it come from?<br>
TORRES: My guess is it came from the distortion ring.<br>
JANEWAY: Somebody's definitely trying to tell us something.<br>
TORRES: That's not all, Captain. Our entire database has been copied
and downloaded into somebody else's system.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I guess whoever they were, they want to know everything they
can about us too.<br>
JANEWAY: Maybe it was their only way of communicating with us. Maybe
they were just trying to say hello.<br>

NEELIX: Cake, anyone?<br>
KES: Neelix, what happened to you?<br>
NEELIX: Oh, it's a long story. I'll tell you all about it later. Right
now, it's time to finish your party.<br>
KES: Neelix, I need a photograph of you.<br>
NEELIX: What for, sweeting?<br>
KES: From now on, even when we're separated, I want to have you where I
can keep my eye on you.<br>
