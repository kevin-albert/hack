comes running down the valley side with a large fruit in his hand.) <br>
CAREY: Commander! Look at this. I think they're some kind of apple.
There are trees filled with them as far as the eye can see, just over
that ridge.<br>
NEELIX: Kaylos. Ah. Aren't they gorgeous? One bite'll kill you. Puff
you up like a vakol fish. First your windpipe swells, and just when you
think you're going to die of suffocation, ow! Oh, you get a sharp pain
in your knees, which begins to work its way right up to <br>
(Chakotay stops Neelix's pointing finger.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: I think we get the picture.<br>
NEELIX: Sorry, Mister Carey. Just remember the old trader's axiom.
Never judge a fruit by its skin. Er, on the other hand, take a bite.<br>
(Neelix hands Chakotay a mandrake type root with some leaves on top.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: What is it?<br>
NEELIX: A leola root.<br>
(Chakotay takes a bite, then spits it out.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: You expect us to eat this?<br>
NEELIX: This is the reason I brought you here, Commander. There's no
better source of vitamins and minerals in the quadrant than in this,
this ugly little root.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'd find the second best source acceptable if it tasted
better.<br>
NEELIX: You humans! You're not used to roughing it, are you? Well, you
take it from one who knows. The day may come when you'll relish every
last crunch of leola. <br>
(They start pulling them out of the ground.)<br>

even notice the mildew. </font></p>

Captain, I don't think we're alone. Mister Tuvok, run a lateral EM scan
for me. Coordinates eight one mark four zero.<br>
TUVOK: Running scan.<br>
JANEWAY: What do you see, Mister Paris?<br>
PARIS: It's like a reflection, something in low orbit when it moves
into a certain angle from the sun.<br>
TUVOK: He's correct. I am picking up an ionization trail. There is
another ship in orbit.<br>
JANEWAY: Using some kind of cloaking device.<br>
TUVOK: It's not a cloaking device as we know it, Captain. I cannot say
for certain what it is, but the ship does employ some kind of masking
circuitry that has affected our sensors.<br>

CHAKOTAY: Captain. Transporter Room, get ready to begin on my command.<br>
KIM: Where's Ensign Seska?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Seska. Transporter room, can you locate Ensign
Seska's comm. badge signal?<br>
CREWMAN [OC]: Negative, Commander. I'm not reading any sign of her.<br>
KIM: She was picking berries with our group over by the hillside. There
were caves nearby.<br>
CHAKOTAY: If she went inside one, it might be blocking her comm. badge
signal. The rest of you get back to the ship. I'm going to look for
her. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Cave]</b>

(Chakotay hides when he hears voices from deep inside the cave. A pair
of Kazon walk past, and Chakotay heads further in. Seska points a
phaser at him.) <br>
SESKA: Oh, thank the Prophets.<br>
CHAKOTAY: What are you doing here?<br>
SESKA: Mushrooms. I saw them growing by the mouth of the cave. I wanted
to teach Neelix how to make your favourite soup.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I appreciate the thought, but we've got to get out of here. <br>
(Kazons start shooting at them. Chakotay is hit. Seska deals with their
attackers then helps Chakotay out of the cave.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
Captain's log, stardate 48658.2. We successfully left orbit without

CHAKOTAY: Come in.<br>
(Seska enters, carrying a covered dish.) <br>
SESKA: I didn't think I'd make it. Feeling better?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Yeah. What have you got there?<br>
SESKA: Real food.<br>
CHAKOTAY: You got Neelix to make some mushroom soup!<br>
SESKA: Are you kidding? The man wanted to stretch the mushrooms with
just a little <br>
BOTH: Leola root.<br>
SESKA: We got into this tug-of-war with the bag of mushrooms in the
middle. It was the most ludicrous thing you've ever seen. Tuvok and Kes
broke us up, and then Neelix threw me out of his kitchen.<br>
CHAKOTAY: So how did you? <br>
SESKA: Strictly a Maquis operation.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Mm hmm.<br>
SESKA: First we arranged for a little morale crisis. A couple of our
people suddenly came down with severe homesickness. Neelix, our devoted
morale officer, responded to the call and came in to cheer them up. And
while they are all singing Rakan folk songs, Jackson and I broke into
the kitchen.<br>
(Chakotay stops laughing and eating.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: You looted the food reserves?<br>
SESKA: Well, if he's not going to give us a decent meal.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I can't believe you did this.<br>
SESKA: Well, it's not like we're hiding anything. I did bring soup
straight to the First Officer, didn't I?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Thanks for including me in a criminal conspiracy. Does he
know about this yet?<br>
SESKA: Well, the moral crisis ended a few minutes ago, so I'd say <br>
NEELIX [OC]: Neelix to Chakotay!<br>
SESKA: That he probably does.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Go ahead, Neelix.<br>
NEELIX [OC]: I'd like to report a crime. Someone has broken into my
kitchen and stolen food, taken food out of the mouths of their crew
mates.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I know.<br>
NEELIX [OC]: It was that Seska, wasn't it?<br>
CHAKOTAY: I promise you, everyone involved will be disciplined.<br>
NEELIX [OC]: If you'd like my recommendations for punishment, I <br>
CHAKOTAY: Thank you. I'll handle that. Chakotay out. Replicator
privileges revoked for two days. Everyone, including me.<br>
SESKA: They're not going to do it.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Then I'll personally put them in the brig.<br>
SESKA: You'd put me in the brig? After all we've been through? <br>
(Seska embraces Chakotay from behind, and strokes his chest.) <br>
SESKA: The soup was worth losing the replicator privileges for two
days. Admit it.<br>
CHAKOTAY: That's not the point.<br>
SESKA: I get the point. Can we make up now? Who else knows how to make
your favourite soup like I do?<br>
CHAKOTAY: No one, but we agreed a long time ago this wouldn't work.<br>
SESKA: Look around, Chakotay. There aren't that many potential mates
out here. Of course, if you're not interested, I have had my eye on
young Ensign Kim.<br>
(Seska leaves.) <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Janeway to all senior officers. Please report to the
Bridge. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (It is
a fuzzy image.) <br>
KAZON [on viewscreen]: We require help. Immediately. Anyone who can
hear this message, please help.<br>
JANEWAY: Long-range scanners picked up the distress signal three
minutes ago.<br>
TUVOK: The ship's dimensions are identical to the vessel we encountered
at the planet. It is a Kazon-Nistrim ship, Captain.<br>
NEELIX: Captain, this may be a trap. The Kazon-Nistrim is one of the
most violent sects in the entire Kazon collective.<br>
KAZON [on viewscreen]: We need immediate assistance. We have lost all
bridge operations. Barely able to function. Please assist.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Kim. Can you determine that this ship has sustained
genuine damage?<br>
KIM: There are fluctuating nucleonic patterns. It might indicate a
reactor breakdown on board.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Paris, run an extended scanner sequence to identify any
other Kazon ships that might be in the area.<br>
PARIS: Nothing showing up, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Maintain scans and set a heading to intercept.<br>
PARIS: New heading entered.<br>
JANEWAY: I take your warning seriously, Neelix, and we'll act with
caution, but if we can help we should. Besides, this may be an
opportunity to make a friend and out here, we can use all the friends
we can get. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Tuvok,
Torres, Seska and Chakotay beam aboard the dark little ship. It's crew
seem to be melted into the bulkheads.) <br>
TORRES: What could do something like this?<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm showing high levels of nucleonic radiation. It seems to
be isolated in that area.<br>
TUVOK: It is likely that the ship's automatic containment systems were
activated when the radiation entered the bridge. We should be safe as
long as we stay on this side of the force field.<br>
SESKA: Someone's alive over here.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Away team to Voyager. We've got a single male Kazon alive on
the bridge. Transport him directly to Sickbay.<br>
KIM [OC]: Energising.<br>
(The Kazon is beamed out.) <br>
TUVOK: It appears the explosion emanated from this console.<br>
TORRES: Does something look a little odd about it to you?<br>
TUVOK: The structural pattern does not conform to the rest of the
bridge.<br>
TORRES: No, there's something else strange about it. The residue has a
point four one percent trace of a neosorium composite, and I don't know
anyone who uses neosorium technology except for the Federation. So how
did it get into the hands of the Kazon? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
Incredible. Somehow virtually every cell in his body has been altered.<br>
JANEWAY: Altered?<br>
EMH: His cells have mutated. Or they've been fused with inorganic
matter. I can't make heads or tails of it. Look at this. His blood
cells have bonded with metallic nuclei.<br>
CHAKOTAY: The crew members closest to the explosion were virtually
melded with huge pieces of metal fragments. He was luckier than the
others.<br>
EMH: That remains to be seen. I'm going to have to do a complete
pyrocyte replacement if we're going to keep him alive. We'd better hope
there are compatible donors on board.<br>
KES: I'll run a cytological screening of the crew.<br>
EMH: We'll let you know the results as soon as we can. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
Captain, there was an apparent Federation signature to the explosion.<br>
JANEWAY: What?<br>
CHAKOTAY: It looked like they were trying to install some new
technology that detonated.<br>
JANEWAY: You're saying they have some kind of Federation weapon on
board?<br>
CHAKOTAY: A console on the bridge was the source of the explosion.
We're not sure what its function was, and it's going to be hard to get
to.<br>
JANEWAY: We can't transport it out?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Not with those levels of nucleonic radiation. The transporter
beam would disperse the moment it hit the irradiated cabin.<br>
JANEWAY: How could they possibly have Federation technology?<br>
TUVOK: There are only three alternatives I can discern at this time.
One, it is not Federation technology at all but something similar. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Turbolift]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Bridge.<br>
TUVOK: Two, another Federation starship may have been brought to the
Delta Quadrant prior to our arrival, and they interacted with the
Kazon-Nistrim.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Were there any other reports of missing starships?<br>
JANEWAY: Not to my knowledge.<br>
TUVOK: Three, someone from this ship has covertly given technology to
the Kazon.<br>
JANEWAY: Computer, hold turbolift. I don't like number three at all,
Tuvok.<br>
TUVOK: Nevertheless, it is the most probable explanation. It may not be
a coincidence that the Kazon ship we encountered at the planet was able
to deceive our sensors. Perhaps someone transmitted instructions to
them before we arrived.<br>
JANEWAY: I want you to personally go through the transmission logs,
Tuvok. Compare them to the actual telemetry. See if there's any
evidence of prior contact with the Kazon. Who would have had a chance
to meet with them while you were on the surface?<br>
CHAKOTAY: A dozen people. We were scattered all over the area.<br>
TUVOK: You did discover Ensign Seska in proximity to them.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Seska almost killed me because she thought I was Kazon. She
wouldn't do something like this.<br>
TUVOK: Nevertheless, I urge you to regard her with caution for the time
being.<br>
JANEWAY: Why would anyone on this ship betray us? We're all in this
together. We need to retrieve that console and get some answers before
the rumours get out of hand. Computer, resume. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
Releasing the force field isn't an option. That would just allow the
radiation into the whole cabin.<br>
SESKA: We could generate a localised subspace bubble to get past the
force field.<br>
TORRES: One minor subspace disruption and you're dead. It's too risky.<br>
SESKA: I'd be willing to risk it.<br>
CAREY: We could use an expander to manipulate the containment field.<br>
TORRES: Manipulate it how?<br>
CAREY: Move it out of the way. Rotate the field and the radiation
trapped inside it away from the console. Once it's clear, we have
access.<br>
JANEWAY: How long will it take to set this up?<br>
TORRES: We, er, we should be able to make an attempt by tomorrow.<br>
JANEWAY: I want it ready by the end of the day.<br>
TORRES: No, Captain. When I say tomorrow, I mean tomorrow. I don't
exaggerate. Tomorrow is the best I can do.<br>
JANEWAY: Understood, Lieutenant.<br>
(Janeway leaves.) <br>
TORRES: All right. We'll begin on the Kazon bridge. Carey, Nicoletti,
Seska.<br>
CHAKOTAY: No. I want Ensign Seska to coordinate the operation from our
bridge.<br>
TORRES: Okay. Henard, you're with us. Dismissed. </font></p>

to do on the Bridge.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I disagree. We need someone up there who<br>
SESKA: What the hell is going on?<br>
CHAKOTAY: There's some concern about you.<br>
SESKA: What kind of concern?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Concern because I found you near the Kazon on the planet.<br>
SESKA: Oh, I see. So now I'm a traitor. I sell technology to the enemy.
<br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't believe that.<br>
SESKA: No, you just take me off my assignment.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm trying to take you out of harm's way to protect you.<br>
SESKA: This is your idea of protection? You might as well point a
finger at me in front of the entire crew!<br>
CHAKOTAY: You don't assign someone you don't trust to the Bridge. Look,
I'm sorry, but if something goes wrong over there, I don't want you
anywhere near it.<br>

KES: Not very good. We need to completely replace his blood.<br>
SESKA: Will he regain consciousness?<br>
EMH: I'm not sure. Even if he does, there's no way to predict what kind
of brain damage there might be.<br>
SESKA: He's the only one who really knows what happened on that ship,
Doctor. The only one who can tell them I had nothing to do with it.<br>
EMH: You? I don't understand.<br>
SESKA: Would you call me right away if he wakes up?<br>
EMH: All right.<br>
KES: Ensign, did you ever come in to leave a blood sample on file?<br>
SESKA: No. I never got around to it. Why?<br>
KES: I've been running a crew compatibility analysis and your file
never came up.<br>
SESKA: My blood won't help you. I had a childhood disease that infected
it. I was warned never to donate blood for transfusion.<br>
EMH: All the more reason we should have your blood on file.<br>

of. </font></p>

TUVOK: The signal was masked by a test of the dorsal emitters that we
conducted a week ago.<br>
JANEWAY: Who was working on that test?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Only the whole engineering crew.<br>
TUVOK: We're trying to trace the station where the signal originated.
Again, the perpetrator was skilled enough to make the tracking process
extremely difficult for us.<br>

(Janeway and Tuvok enter with Culluh and his escort.) <br>
EMH: Ah, Captain. I'm glad you're here. I was just about to call you.<br>
JANEWAY: Doctor, this is First Maje Culluh of the Kazon-Nistrim. Could
you give us the latest condition report on your Kazon patient?<br>
EMH: Well, the good news is, we've been able to stabilise him. We had
to completely replace his blood.<br>
CULLUH: Replace his blood? With what?<br>
JANEWAY: The blood of volunteers from our crew. They saved his life.<br>
EMH: His own blood cells were killing him. They were changed by the
accident on his ship.<br>
CULLUH: Changed in what manner?<br>
EMH: We haven't been able to determine that yet.<br>
JANEWAY: We've been working on a plan to access the source of the
explosion, which should answer a lot of the questions.<br>
CULLUH: That will no longer be necessary. We will take the damaged
vessel to our port for inspection.<br>
JANEWAY: I'm afraid I can't allow you to do that just yet.<br>
CULLUH: And what gives you the right to interfere in our affairs?<br>
JANEWAY: There was a trace of a Federation compound in the remains of
the explosion. We have reason to believe that someone on board this
ship gave technology to your people. Until we have a better explanation
of what occurred, I can't release that ship to you.<br>
CULLUH: That is not acceptable.<br>
JANEWAY: It will have to be.<br>
CULLUH: Your unique technologies make you brave, Captain, but you have
only one ship. In less than a day there will be four Kazon vessels off
your bow.<br>
JANEWAY: Perhaps by then we'll have the answers we need.<br>
CULLUH: You will leave us with him.<br>
(Janeway and the EMH move away from the biobed.) <br>
JANEWAY: I assume they'll want to take him back to their ship. I'd
rather not let them do it just yet in case he regains consciousness.
There are a lot of questions he can answer. Can I tell them it's not
safe to move him?<br>
EMH: It will be the truth.<br>
JANEWAY: Good.<br>
(A needle comes from Culluh's ring and he injects the injured Kazon.
Tuvok spots in and leaps forward to grab him.) <br>
EMH: He's dead.<br>
JANEWAY: Get off this ship.<br>
(Tuvok escorts the Kazon out.) <br>
EMH: There was some kind of nerve toxin in that needle. He died
instantly. Captain, may we talk to you in my office? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Doctor's
office]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
It's about Seska.<br>
JANEWAY: Complications?<br>
KES: I was analysing her blood chemistry to try to locate a compatible
donor. But when I got the results, her blood was lacking all the common
Bajoran blood factors.<br>
JANEWAY: Meaning?<br>
SESKA: The only conclusion we can reach is that she is not, in fact,
Bajoran. It appears Seska has been genetically altered. My suspicion is
she was born Cardassian. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Ready

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
CHAKOTAY: You're making me to believe she's a Cardassian agent who
infiltrated the Maquis?<br>
TUVOK: Starfleet Security has documented several incidents in which
Cardassian have used cosmetic alterations for the purpose of
infiltrating an enemy.<br>
CHAKOTAY: This is crazy. This is just impossible.<br>
TUVOK: The Doctor has informed us that there's no other plausible
explanation for the medical anomalies, Commander.<br>
CHAKOTAY: If you don't mind, I'd like to hear her explanation before we
dismiss it. Has she been told?<br>
JANEWAY: No.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'd like to be the one who questions her.<br>
JANEWAY: I suggest we wait until we retrieve the console. Janeway to
Torres. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
Yes, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Your status?<br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES
[OC]: Everything looks okay. We're ready to beam over.<br>
JANEWAY: Good. Then let's get started. Janeway out.<br>
(Janeway leaves.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: You were working for her. Seska was working for them. Was
anyone on board that ship working for me? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
The Kazon ship is hailing us.<br>
JANEWAY: Open a channel. On screen.<br>
CULLUH [on viewscreen]: Our sensors show that you are trespassing on
our vessel.<br>
JANEWAY: As I've already informed you, we're attempting to retrieve the
console that caused this explosion.<br>
CULLUH [on viewscreen]: If you attempt to remove anything from our
ship, it will be considered an act of war.<br>
JANEWAY: You know, I'm really easy to get along with most of the time.
But I don't like bullies, and I don't like threats, and I don't like
you, Culluh. You can try and stop us from getting to the truth, but I
promise you, if you do I will respond with all the unique technologies
at my command. Janeway out.<br>
TUVOK: Their weapon systems are standing down. They do not appear to be
posing a threat to us at this time.<br>
JANEWAY: At least not until reinforcements get here. Janeway to Away
team.<br>
TORRES [OC]: Yes, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: I don't want to rush you, Lieutenant, but<br>
TORRES [OC]: We're finished, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: I beg your pardon?<br>
TORRES [OC]: Decontamination went exactly as planned. The console has
been transported to Engineering, and we're on our way back now.<br>
JANEWAY: Acknowledged. Well done, Away team. We'll meet you in
Engineering. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
Of all the things to die for. It's a food replicator, or at least it
was trying to be.<br>
JANEWAY: We may take replicators for granted, but imagine what it would
mean to a culture that doesn't have this technology.<br>
TORRES: They didn't use a thick enough interior shield casing. Once the
nucleonic radiation leaked out, a cascade reaction was inevitable.<br>
JANEWAY: Can you tell if any part of the console came from out ship?<br>
TORRES: There's no doubt about it, Captain. The pattern buffer relays
are clearly composed of bio-neural fibres. No other Federation ship
would have them. Somebody on board Voyager gave them what they needed.
I guess they just didn't know what to do with it.<br>
JANEWAY: I want a complete report on everything we've found so I can
share it with our Kazon friends. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
(Chakotay enters, and Kes leaves.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: We've recovered the console. It's a replicator, constructed
with materials from Voyager.<br>
SESKA: I suppose now everyone thinks I went over there to destroy the
evidence.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Did you?<br>
SESKA: I was only trying to show everyone, show you. You really think I
had something to do with this, don't you?<br>
CHAKOTAY: To be honest, I'm not sure anymore. I'm not sure of a lot of
things.<br>
SESKA: Well, why don't you go talk to your animal guide and figure it
all out?<br>
CHAKOTAY: I plan to.<br>
SESKA: Good. Get back to me when you do.<br>
CHAKOTAY: You know, it's funny. I've been thinking about what's been
real and what's not been real.<br>
SESKA: What is this about? What's wrong with you? Talk to me, Chakotay.
You owe me that much.<br>
CHAKOTAY: What would you say I owe to a Cardassian who infiltrated my
crew?<br>
SESKA: What are you talking about?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Isn't that why you never got around to a blood analysis when
we came on board?<br>
SESKA: I didn't get around to it because I didn't get around to it.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Turns out your blood is missing all the common Bajoran blood
factors.<br>
SESKA: It's a side effect of Orkett's disease. Ask your doctor.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Orkett's disease.<br>
SESKA: A childhood virus that swept through the Bajoran work camps
during the occupation. Thousands of children didn't survive. I did,
thanks to a bone marrow transplant from a sympathetic Cardassian woman.
Her name was Kattell. When we get home, you can ask her yourself. You
must think I'm horrible. Do you think I gave you my, my heart to get
your Maquis secrets?<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm starting to wonder.<br>
SESKA: Let me tell you something. Your secrets weren't good enough.
They wouldn't have been worth the trouble for a Cardassian agent. I had
only one agenda with you, Chakotay, and I never kept it secret. So, do
you believe in me again?<br>
CHAKOTAY: I want to.<br>
SESKA: Good. Because I want to go back to work.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Let's not rush things.<br>
SESKA: I'm going stir crazy in here.<br>
CHAKOTAY: You're going to have to stay confined, at least until we find
out exactly where the replicator components were taken from.<br>
SESKA: Well, what'll that tell you?<br>
CHAKOTAY: There might be evidence of who took them.<br>
SESKA: Oh, you don't think whoever did this is foolish enough to log in
using their own name?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Chief Inspector Tuvok leaves no stone unturned. I'll tell the
Captain what you told me. Somehow we'll try to clear this up soon. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
CHAKOTAY: She said a Cardassian bone marrow transplant saved her life
as a child.<br>
TUVOK: Did you set our plan in motion? I gave Lieutenant Carey the same
information.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Now all we can do is wait and hope someone takes the bait. </font></p>

TUVOK: Gin.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I never knew Vulcans had such a talent for cards.<br>
TUVOK: It is simply a matter of logical discards, which give a false
impression of my own requirements and deny the needed cards to your
hand. I believe that's ninety four points to me.<br>
CHAKOTAY: If you ever need a sponsor in a gin tournament, let me know.<br>
TORRES: We're picking up two more Kazon warships about six hours away.
We're not going to be able to stay her much <br>
(Beep! Beep!) <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's sounds like a nibble to me.<br>
TUVOK: Someone is accessing the inventory data base.<br>
TORRES: And they're going straight to the missing replicator materials.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Should we start the trace now?<br>
TUVOK: Negative. It might alert them.<br>
TORRES: They're entering data.<br>
TUVOK: Intriguing. It appears as though they're trying to place
evidence at the scene of the crime to indicate the guilty party.<br>
TORRES: They're entering an encrypted security code into the materials
requisition file.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Which would suggest they're hiding it. But not very well.<br>
TORRES: Anybody know whose security code that belongs to?<br>
CHAKOTAY: I do. It's Seska's.<br>
TORRES: Then it has to be Carey. Carey is trying to point the finger at
Seska. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> SESKA:
Chakotay. Is anything wrong?<br>
CHAKOTAY: It's over. We know who gave the technology to the Kazon.<br>
SESKA: Who?<br>
CHAKOTAY: You did.<br>
SESKA: Look, I don't know what evidence you think you've found, but<br>
CHAKOTAY: We found the evidence you put there for us to find. Your own
security code.<br>
SESKA: I have no idea what you're talking about.<br>
CHAKOTAY: We already knew where the stolen materials had been taken
from before I met with you. We were monitoring the inventory manifest,
hoping either you or Carey would try to cover your tracks.<br>
SESKA: Hell of a way for me to cover my tracks, putting in my own
security code for you to find.<br>
CHAKOTAY: That's exactly what you did. You knew no one would believe
you could be that careless. You wanted us to believe that someone else
was trying to frame you.<br>
SESKA: Ever consider that maybe someone was?<br>
CHAKOTAY: We traced the computer station used to enter the data. Oh,
you took us all around the system and back again before we could locate
the source, but it was this station, in Sickbay.<br>
(The lights come up. Janeway and Tuvok enter with two Security guards.)
<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'd almost say it was a Maquis operation, if I didn't already
know you were a Cardassian. Computer, activate Emergency Holographic
Medical Programme.<br>
EMH: Ah. Have I been called to testify?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Before you even mentioned Orkett's disease to me, the Doctor
had already discounted that as a possible explanation for your blood
anomalies.<br>
EMH: And may I say a doctor less informed about Bajoran medicine might
have been fooled, but my programme includes the complete Bajoran
medical text on Orkett's disease. There's no way any childhood virus or
Cardassian bone marrow transplant can explain away the genetic markers
in your blood. You are Cardassian, Ensign.<br>
CHAKOTAY: But that didn't necessarily make you the traitor we were
looking for. We needed more evidence, and you gave it to us. The one
thing I still can't understand is why?<br>
SESKA: I did it for you. I did it for this crew. We are alone here, at
the mercy of any number of hostile aliens, because of the
incomprehensible decision of a Federation Captain. A Federation Captain
who destroyed our only chance to get home. Federation rules. Federation
nobility. Federation compassion? Do you understand, if this had been a
Cardassian ship, we would be home now. We must begin to forge
alliances. To survive, we must have powerful friends. The Kazon-Nistrim
were willing to be our protectors in return for some minor technology.<br>
JANEWAY: Minor technology that could change the balance of power in
this quadrant.<br>
SESKA: Change it in our favour! That is all that matters at this point.
Building a base of power in this quadrant. You are a fool, Captain, and
you're a fool to follow her. I can't imagine how I ever loved you.
Computer, command XJL.<br>
(Seska beams out.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Computer, override transport in progress.<br>

CHAKOTAY: Can I ask you to be honest with me, Lieutenant?<br>
TUVOK: As a Vulcan, I am at all times honest, Commander.<br>

yourself off as a Maquis to get on my crew.<br>
TUVOK: I was honest to my own convictions within the defined parameters
of my mission.<br>
CHAKOTAY: You damned Vulcans and your defined parameters. That's easy

TUVOK: On the contrary. The demands on a Vulcan's character are
extraordinarily difficult. Do not mistake composure for ease. How may I
be honest with you today?<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'd just like to know, from someone else who pulled the wool
over my eyes, was I particularly naive? Was I not paying enough
attention? What the hell was it that let all you spies get by me?<br>
TUVOK: Like all humans, you depend on feelings and instincts to guide
you, and they invariably let you down. But particularly naive? No,
Commander, and I've always considered your attention span to be
adequate.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Did you ever see anything about Seska that make you
suspicious?<br>
TUVOK: No. She quite expertly pulled the wool over my eyes as well.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Well, that makes me feel a little better. Thanks.<br>
TUVOK: Curious.<br>
CHAKOTAY: What?<br>
TUVOK: That my failure, added to your own, should improve your feelings.<br>
