Captain's log, stardate 41636.9. As feared, our examination of the
seven year overdue Federation freighter, Odin, disabled by an asteroid
collision, revealed no survivors. However, three escape pods were
missing, suggesting the possibility of survivors.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: Ready to begin orbit of Angel One,
Captain. <br>
PICARD: Make it so, Mister La Forge. What kind of place is this, Data? <br>
DATA: Angel One is a class M planet, sir, supporting carbon based flora
and fauna, sparsely populated with intelligent life forms. It is
similar in technological development to mid-twentieth century Earth. <br>
LAFORGE: Kind of like being marooned at home. <br>
RIKER: Assuming any of the survivors made it this far. Admittedly, it
'is the closest planet to the
Odin, but to travel distance we did in two days at warp one would have
taken the Odin escape pod five months. <br>
DATA: Five months, fourteen days, eleven hours, two minutes <br>
RIKER: Thank you, Data. <br>
DATA: And fifty seven seconds. <br>
TASHA: Captain, we're receiving an audio signal from Angel One. <br>
PICARD: Starfleet are adamant that we maintain excellent diplomatic
relations with this planet. Mister Data, is there any other pertinent
information before we reply? <br>
DATA: Angel One has evolved into a constitutional oligarchy. It is
governed by a parliamentary body consisting of six elected Mistresses,
and headed by a female they refer to as The Elected One.<br>
TROI: It sounds like my own planet. <br>
WORF: Klingons appreciate strong women. <br>
PICARD: How current is this information, Mister Data? <br>
DATA: A Federation vessel last visited this planet sixty two years ago,
Captain. <br>
PICARD: Counsellor, as this is a female dominated society, you might
wish to make the initial contact. <br>
TROI: Thank you, sir. <br>
PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. <br>
TASHA: Hailing frequencies open, sir. <br>
TROI: This is Counsellor Deanna Troi from the USS Enterprise. <br>
BEATA: [OC]: I am Beata, The Elected One. How may we assist you,
Counsellor? <br>
TROI: The Federation has neglected to visit to your planet for far too
long. With your permission, we would like to correct that oversight. <br>
BEATA: [OC]: We feel in no way neglected, Counsellor. A diplomatic
courtesy call is neither expected nor required. <br>
TROI: We also come in search of possible survivors from one of our
freighters. <br>
BEATA: [OC]: A brief visit will be tolerated. <br>
TASHA: They've broken off transmission. <br>

vital. Starfleet's hope is that one day this world may become part of
the Federation. <br>
RIKER: We'll do our best to make a good impression, sir. <br>
PICARD: Energise.

beamed down to an unusual matriarchal society where the female is as
aggressively dominant as the male gender was on Earth hundreds of years
ago. Here, the female is the hunter, the soldier, larger and stronger
than the male. An arrangement considered most sensible and natural. </font></p>

BEATA: I am Beata, The Elected One of Angel One. Representatives of the
Starfleet Enterprise, do you wish to petition? <br>
TROI: We do. We have reason to hope that survivors from a damaged
Federation freighter may be marooned on your planet. We are seeking to
learn if this is so. <br>
BEATA: Even a planet as remote as Angel One has heard of Starfleet.
Searching the galaxy for survivors seems a petty task for one of their
mighty vessels. <br>
RIKER: We don't consider even one survivor petty. <br>
BEATA: Is this man implying that we put a lesser value on life than you
do? <br>
TROI: Not at all. Our discovery of the freighter was unexpected. We
have a duty to investigate. <br>
BEATA: I see. And if you find any survivors, what then? <br>
TROI: We will take them with us and see that they were reunited with
their families. <br>
ARIEL: Are we to take these strangers at their word? <br>
BEATA: Good question. <br>
TASHA: What reason could we possibly have to deceive you? <br>
BEATA: Another good question. <br>
RIKER: Are there survivors from the freighter Odin on your planet? <br>
BEATA: I'm not prepared to answer, yet. See to their comforts. <br>

TASHA: Yes. Tricorder doesn't show any listening devices or anything
else of a threatening nature. <br>
RIKER: Good. Troi? <br>
TROI: There was much fear in that room.<br>
RIKER: Paranoia, I'd say. But of what? <br>
TROI: I cannot say. But their fear was not focused. I sensed that all
were not concerned for the same reason. Undoubtedly there are survivors
from the Odin on this planet. <br>
RIKER: I agree. Otherwise, why would they be so circumspect? <br>
TASHA: As Mistress Beata is so fond of saying, good question.<br>

WESLEY: We finished our ski lesson, sir, and it kind of just happened. <br>
PICARD: On the Enterprise, Mister Crusher, nothing just happens. What
is that smell? <br>
WORF: Hmm, yes. Slightly reminiscent of night blooming throgni,
Captain. From home. Quite stimulating, wouldn't you say? <br>

TASHA: Certain cultures consider perfume an aphrodisiac. <br>

on that? <br>
TROI: We are.<br>
BEATA: You should know that the vote was not unanimous. Some of those
among us are suspicious. Yet the majority feel that we have no choice
but to trust you. <br>
RIKER: We don't understand the source of your misgivings, Mistress, but
we appreciate your faith in us. <br>
BEATA: Make certain that faith is not misplaced. There are four
survivors from the ship you call Odin. All male. Their leader is a man
who calls himself Ramsey. <br>
TROI: If you'll deliver these men to us, we'll have them off your
planet immediately. <br>
BEATA: If they were mine to deliver, I would do it without hesitation.
Unfortunately, their hiding place has long eluded us. <br>
TASHA: Hiding place? Why are they in hiding? <br>
BEATA: Because they are fugitives on Angel One, and the quicker we get
rid of them, the better. When these men came to us seven years ago,
they accepted our hospitality quickly enough. But they gradually became
restive, started making unreasonable demands, went against the natural
order. <br>
TROI: Using the technology of the Enterprise, we might be able to find
these men. <br>

dangerous. </font></p>

who knows what he wants.<br>

BEATA: Exactly. I knew you were bright enough to understand. You see,
women, by our very nature, want only what is best for their men. <br>
RIKER: Men are not objects to be possessed, Mistress Beata. <br>
BEATA: Of course they're not. It was merely a figure of speech. <br>

guaranteed to make you feel better. <br>

CRUSHER: I knew you'd like it. Are you wearing cologne? Like something
I smelled earlier. Something Klingon.<br>
PICARD: Lieutenant Worf and I detected the same scent when we bumped
into your son at the Holodeck. <br>
CRUSHER: It's that smell. That's how the virus travels. An airborne
particle whose sweet scent inspires deep inhalation. And once inside
the body, it becomes that damned virus. I have work to do. <br>

medical situation? <br>
DATA: Doctor Crusher feels the virus will undoubtedly run unchecked
through the entire ship. Attempts to develop an inoculants have so far
ended in failure. Lieutenant La Forge still has Bridge command pending
your return, sir. <br>
RIKER: And what about the Romulans entering the Neutral Zone? <br>
DATA: The border outpost reports a contingent of seven Romulan
battlecruisers within sensor range. The USS Berlin has answered the
distress call. However, should hostilities erupt, both the outpost and
the starship will be out-gunned. It is felt that the Enterprise's
presence in the area will be a vital show of force. <br>
TASHA: Some show of force. The Enterprise could fly on autopilot, but
with that virus knocking down our crew, we're going to be in sorry
shape if things turn ugly. <br>
RIKER: I think it's time we to leave this place. <br>
TROI: It doesn't feel right to leave while Beata is determined to
execute those people. <br>
RIKER: She has to find them first. Ramsey and his bunch have been
fugitives for years. I suspect he's pretty good at evading capture. <br>

RAMSEY: We were no harm to anyone. Why did you tell them where to find
us? <br>
BEATA: You brought this upon yourself. You and the traitor. One does
not need the technology of the Enterprise to follow Mistress Ariel
sneaking out to warn her husband. Let her stand with him now. For
tomorrow they will die together. </font></p>

RIKER: Why? Because I'm only a man? <br>
BEATA: You'll accomplish nothing with that attitude. <br>
RIKER: Mistress Beata, if you had an alternative to the execution of
Ramsey and his followers, would you take it? <br>
BEATA: Is that not the way of an advanced society? <br>

try to convince them to leave with us.<br>

their will would be a violation of several Starfleet regulations, not
the least of which would be the Prime Directive. <br>

than live with the guilt of leaving these people to their deaths.

entitled to execute your laws or your citizens as you see fit. <br>
BEATA: Make your point, so we can proceed with this unpleasant
business. <br>
RIKER: When you spoke of the prisoners, you used the term
revolutionary. Indeed, death has been known to stop revolutions. But I
suspect it's not a revolution that Angel One is hoping to stop. It's
evolution. Mister Ramsey and the Odin survivors did not initiate the
waves of dissent that are rippling through your planet. Their presence
here merely reinforced the change in attitudes between men and women
that was already well under way. They became symbols around whom others
who shared their views could gather. You may eliminate the symbols, but
that does not mean death to the issues which those symbols represent.
No power in the universe can hope to stop the force of evolution. Be
warned. The execution of Mister Ramsey and his followers may elevate
them to the status of martyrs. Martyrs cannot be silenced. <br>
