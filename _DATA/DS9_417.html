Log, stardate 46925.1. We have been honoured with a visit by a
delegation of Federation ambassadors on a fact-finding mission to the
wormhole. Fortunately I have just the officer to take them off my
hands.

Ambassador. <br>
TAXCO: (alien red-head) Madam Ambassador. <br>
BASHIR: Madam Ambassador. But all the guest quarters on the station are
roughly the same size. <br>
TAXCO: Then move me to the crew level. <br>
BASHIR: All the quarters on the crew level are currently occupied. <br>
TAXCO: Then someone can move. You, for example. <br>
VADOSIA: (Bolian) She did the same thing during the voyage here. She's
never satisfied. <br>
TAXCO: At least I didn't bother the Captain every hour with some new
suggestion on how to run his ship. <br>
VADOSIA: He welcomed my suggestions, as I'm sure your Commander Sisko
will welcome them. If we ever get to spend any time with him. <br>
BASHIR: Commander Sisko is extremely busy. <br>
VADOSIA: With what? <br>
BASHIR: With the recalibration sweep. <br>
LOJAL: (Vulcan) What are you recalibrating? <br>
BASHIR: Everything. It's a sweeping recalibration of all systems. <br>
LOJAL: I cannot speak for the others, but I would be fascinated to
observe this recalibration, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: You would? After your long trip, I thought you might enjoy
stopping by a holosuite? <br>
TAXCO: Are you actually suggesting we indulge in one of those
disgusting Ferengi sex programmes? <br>
BASHIR: No. I, the holosuites are capable of many different <br>
VADOSIA: Of course that was what he was suggesting. The Arbazan are so
sexually repressed. <br>
TAXCO: Why, this is outrageous. <br>
BASHIR: Perhaps we should all just get some rest. <br>
LOJAL: I did not come all this way to rest, Doctor. I would like to see
your facility. <br>
TAXCO: A first-year officer assigned as our liaison. Starfleet command
will hear of this. <br>
BASHIR: Ambassador. Madam Ambassador, I'm only <br>
(A scream from the garishly dressed and be-wigged Betazoid at the dabo
table) <br>
LWAXANA: Oh! Where is it? It's gone! It's gone! <br>
BASHIR: What's gone, Madam Ambassador? <br>
LWAXANA: My latinum hairbrooch. <br>
BASHIR: Quark! <br>
LWAXANA: I had just made a third straight cross. I was leaning across
the table to pick up the dice again, something brushed against me and
my God, I've been wigged. <br>
QUARK: What's the problem here? <br>
BASHIR: Someone has stolen Ambassador Troi's latinum hairbrooch. <br>
QUARK: I'm sorry, but as the sign says, the establishment is not
responsible for the loss of any personal items. <br>
LWAXANA: Sign? What sign? <br>
QUARK: The one above the door. <br>
BASHIR: You'd have to stand on a chair to read that. <br>
QUARK: House rules. I'm very sorry. Have a nice day. <br>
(Lwaxana grabs him by a lobe) <br>
LWAXANA: You are dealing with a daughter of the Fifth House, Holder of
the sacred Chalice of Rixx, Heir to the holy Rings of Betazed. <br>
QUARK: Not my ear, please! <br>
LWAXANA: Yes, and I know where it hurts the most, you little troll.
Now, I want this room sealed and I want everyone in it strip-searched
until you find my brooch. <br>
ODO: May I be of service? <br>
(Lwaxana lets Quark go) <br>
BASHIR: Oh, thank goodness. Our Chief of Security, Odo. <br>
ODO: What seems to be the problem? <br>
LWAXANA: Well, my brooch has been stolen. It's been in my family for
thirty six generations. It's absolutely priceless, and I want it back. <br>
ODO: You're certain you were wearing it today. <br>
LWAXANA: Yes, of course, I'm certain. I never use this hair without it.
<br>
ODO: I see. You're Betazoid? <br>
LWAXANA: Of course. <br>
ODO: Telepathic. <br>
LWAXANA: Yes. <br>
ODO: And you sense no guilt anywhere in this room? <br>
LWAXANA: (closing her eyes for a quick scan) No, but Betazoids cannot
read Ferengis. <br>
ODO: Quark has plenty of reason to feel guilty, but he usually doesn't
have to resort to petty theft to fleece his clients. <br>
QUARK: Thank you. <br>
(Odo looks around and spots a little alien in a corner, who tries to
scuttle away. Odo stops him.) <br>
ODO: Wait a minute. Empty your pockets now. <br>
(a busy little pick pocket) <br>
ODO: Well, since when did you join Starfleet? <br>
LWAXANA: That's it. That's my brooch. But how did you know? <br>
ODO: Dopterians are distant relatives of the Ferengi. It made sense
that if you couldn't read Quark, you might not be able to read this
charming fellow either. <br>
LWAXANA: How perfectly brilliant of you. <br>
(Odo leaves with the prisoner) <br>
LWAXANA: Doctor, I want to know everything there is to know about your
Security Chief. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: Computer, is the diagnostic on the fusion
power plant finished yet? <br>
COMPUTER: Affirmative. The fusion power plant is operating within
normal parameters. <br>
O'BRIEN: What are you talking about? It's thirteen percent below
normal. <br>
COMPUTER: Cardassian specifications accept operating efficiency within
twenty percent. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, I don't. Anara. <br>
(A Bajoran woman comes over) <br>
ANARA: Yes, sir. <br>
O'BRIEN: How much do you know about the carbon reaction chambers? <br>
ANARA: I've learned a little about laser-induced fusion. Not much more
than the basics. <br>
O'BRIEN: It's a bloody inefficient system, and I'd trade it in for a
Federation model tomorrow if I could. But it's all we've got. Do me a
favour. Keep an eye on the exhaust plasma temperature. Computer,
increase deuterium flow by five percent to reaction chamber two. <br>
COMPUTER: Procedure is not recommended. <br>
O'BRIEN: Look, I've had enough of your opinions, damn it. Just do it. <br>
COMPUTER: Procedure is not recommended. Consult Cardassian operational
guidelines, paragraph two five four A, now on screen. <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't want to read your tech manual. Fine, we'll do it
ourselves. Re-initialising reactor two. Directing plasma stream to
conduits one four three, one four four <br>
ANARA: Chief O'Brien. The power flow from reactor two has just been
shut down. <br>
O'BRIEN: What? Computer, analyse reactor two failure. <br>
COMPUTER: Reactor two was shut down after sensors detected a potential
overload of the carbon reaction chambers. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's it. That's the straw. <br>
SISKO: Relax, Chief. It's just a computer. <br>
O'BRIEN: This is no computer. This is my arch enemy. <br>
SISKO: You've got it working just fine, as far as I can tell. <br>
O'BRIEN: Fine? With all due respect, Commander, as an engineer, I
couldn't look at myself in the mirror if I allowed this computer to
perform as it is now. I'll have to do a root canal. <br>
SISKO: Root canal? <br>
O'BRIEN: It's engineering shorthand, sir. I'll have to get into its
guts and rebuild her from the ground up. <br>
SISKO: How long will that take? <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, I'm still not that familiar with Cardassian technology
but I'd guess no more than two, three years. <br>
SISKO: That's going to take a lot of man-hours. Is it really necessary?
<br>
O'BRIEN: You don't understand. <br>
SISKO: Let's just say I don't have your sensitivity to the computer. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's all right. Forget about it. <br>
SISKO: Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: It's all right. It doesn't matter. <br>
SISKO: Chief, I want you to do what you have to do. <br>
O'BRIEN: Thank you, sir. I'll get on it right away. <br>
(The turbolift has arrived) <br>
BASHIR: And this is Ops. <br>
VADOSIA: The heart and soul of Deep Space Nine. Ah, there you are,
Commander. <br>
SISKO: Gentlemen. Madam Ambassador. <br>
BASHIR: They insisted on seeing Operations, sir. <br>
SISKO: Of course. Make yourself at home. I trust that Doctor Bashir has
been taking care of all your needs. <br>
TAXCO: He refuses to change my accommodations. <br>
SISKO: Accommodations? <br>
TAXCO: If I have to sleep another night on a Cardassian bed with
gargoyles staring at me from the woodpoles <br>
KIRA: Commander, unidentified vessel coming through the wormhole. <br>
SISKO: On screen. Excuse me. <br>
BASHIR: You'll get a better view from over here. <br>
(WHOOSH on the viewscreen) <br>
BASHIR: Quite a sight, isn't it? <br>
VADOSIA: That's it? That's the whole thing? <br>
BASHIR: Well, yes, it is. <br>
VADOSIA: I was expecting more somehow. <br>
DAX: Scanners aren't picking up any lifeforms on board. <br>
SISKO: A probe? <br>
DAX: Might be. I'm reading an extensive computer array but no signals
to suggest it's trying to maintain contact with the mother ship. <br>
SISKO: Are the computers compatible with ours? <br>
DAX: It's hard to tell. I don't recognise any known subprocessor
patterns. <br>
LOJAL: Obviously the young woman doesn't have the necessary experience.
Perhaps I <br>
BASHIR: The young woman over there has over three hundred years
experience, Ambassador. <br>
DAX: I might have better luck if we towed it into the docking ring. <br>
SISKO: No. Not until we know a little more about it. Major, tow it to
five hundred metres off the docking ring. <br>
KIRA: Yes, sir. <br>
SISKO: Mister O'Brien, try to set up an adaptive interface link and see
if we can download any information from it. <br>
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. <br>
BASHIR: I think it will be best if we clear this area. <br>
VADOSIA: But this probe may represent contact with a new species.
Commander, I think it would be appropriate for at least one Federation
Ambassador to be present at this historic occasion, and since I have a
particular interest in first contact procedures <br>
SISKO: I appreciate your interest, Ambassador. And to keep you all
informed, I'm scheduling a briefing at oh four hundred. In the
meantime, Doctor Bashir, the best place to view this probe is from the
docking ring near port seven. <br>
BASHIR: I'll show them the way.

ODO: Most people find it rather tedious. <br>
LWAXANA: Tedious? No, those of us who have been beneficiaries of your

LWAXANA: Odo. It rolls off the tongue. <br>
ODO: I have a lot of work to do. <br>
LWAXANA: I'm understand you're a shape-shifter. <br>
ODO: That's correct. <br>
LWAXANA: I've never been with a shape-shifter. <br>
ODO: Been with? <br>
LWAXANA: I've heard you're the only one of your kind. <br>
ODO: So far. <br>
LWAXANA: All the men I've known have needed to be shaped and molded and
manipulated. Finally I've met a man who knows how to do it himself. <br>

Odo leans back) <br>

ODO: That's her. There was a minor incident at the bar that I helped
her with, and now she's grateful. <br>
SISKO: What's the problem? <br>

Commander, she seems interested in me. <br>

SISKO: A little romance, Odo. <br>
ODO: I have six pylons that need a complete security sweep. I don't
have time for romantic interludes. Frankly, in my humble opinion, most
of you humanoids spend far too much time on your respective mating
rituals. <br>
SISKO: It does help the procreation of one's species. <br>
ODO: Procreation does not require changing how you smell, or writing
bad poetry, or sacrificing various plants to serve as tokens of
affection. In any event, it's all irrelevant to me. <br>
SISKO: I'm sorry to hear that. <br>

know, it wasn't all passion. There was some negligible commercial

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Don't hit one of them, Doctor. I'm not
nearly as understanding as Curzon was. <br>
BASHIR: Yes, sir. <br>
(Bashir leaves) <br>
O'BRIEN: Commander, can I talk to you? It's about the computer, sir. <br>
SISKO: Still giving you problems? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, sir, that's just the thing. It's not. It rerouted the EPS
power flow in less than an hour. <br>
SISKO: That's good news. How soon can we get Odo and the Ambassador
out? <br>
O'BRIEN: We can't. It didn't activate the Turbolift circuits. Don't ask
me why. <br>
SISKO: You must have some idea what's wrong. <br>
O'BRIEN: I want you to listen to something. Computer, analyze Ops O2
sensor readings. <br>
COMPUTER: All sensors read between fourteen point three and fourteen
point four KSC. <br>
O'BRIEN: Computer, restart all shield generator subsystems. <br>
COMPUTER: Shield generator subsystems set to active status. Reading
ninety eight point three percent efficiency. <br>
O'BRIEN: Do you hear it? <br>
SISKO: Hear what? <br>
O'BRIEN: The voice. It's not the same attitude. <br>
SISKO: It sounds like the computer. <br>
O'BRIEN: Sir, when you work with a computer as much as I do, you get to
know it. They're all very different. Working with the Enterprise
computer was like dancing a waltz. With this computer, it's always been
like a wrestling match, till we started downloading the probe. <br>
SISKO: You think some kind of programme from the probe is influencing
our computer? <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, it's got to be more than just a programme, sir. The
computer's whole personality has changed. It's not resisting any
commands, offering any opinions, giving any arguments. And there's this
one other crazy thing I'm almost afraid to mention, <br>
SISKO: What's that? <br>
O'BRIEN: Every time I leave, something happens to bring me back. <br>
SISKO: Bring you back? <br>
O'BRIEN: To the computer. Like the failures to the turbolifts and the
transporters. A few minutes ago, I was working at the transporter pad
and the comm. lines went down. And when I broke for a quick bite to
eat, we had a replicator failure. It's almost like the computer doesn't
want me to leave it alone. <br>
SISKO: You almost make it sound like a child. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Station log, supplemental. Odo and Ambassador Troi
remain trapped in turbolift four. As of yet, we have been unable to
ascertain what it is that's causing the station's computer to
malfunction.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Later, a conference has been called) <br>
DAX: What if it's some kind of non-biological lifeform we've never seen
before? <br>
KIRA: Non-biological? <br>
DAX: Well, it all comes down to how we define lifeform, but just as
biological organisms have evolved in our cultures, mechanical life
could have done the same in others. <br>
KIRA: You're suggesting someone left a baby on our doorstep? <br>
DAX: Possibly. <br>
SISKO: Do you think we can communicate with it? <br>
O'BRIEN: In a way, we already have. I mean, it's part and parcel of our
computer now. <br>
DAX: But as far as direct communication is concerned, it may not be
capable of that. We haven't seen any evidence that this entity is
sentient. <br>
KIRA: It may be more like a stray puppy that's attached itself to you,
Chief. <br>
SISKO: Whatever it is, it's slowly disabling our station. People, we've
got to get it out of there. <br>
O'BRIEN: It came here when we downloaded the probe's files. If we
upload those same files back to the probe, it might go with them. <br>
DAX: What if it's fully integrated itself into our computer? <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't think it has. That would make it more like a virus,
but I don't see any evidence that it's trying to overwrite our control
networks or destroy our systems. I think it's more likely that it
simply creates connections with areas of the computer that are active. <br>
DAX: Almost as though it feeds off the energy of the computer
functions. <br>
O'BRIEN: If I'm right, transferring all of its programming off the
station just might solve our problems. <br>
SISKO: How long since we had any communication from Odo? <br>
KIRA: Comm. lines have been down over ninety minutes. He's been in
there almost four hours now. <br>
SISKO: Do you happen to know the schedule of his regenerative cycle? <br>
KIRA: My god, I have no idea, but if he doesn't get back to his pail in
time <br>
(And later still) <br>
COMPUTER: Subspace emitter aligned. Outgoing data stream activated. <br>
O'BRIEN: Computer, upload all probe command sequences back to probe's
computers. <br>
COMPUTER: Stand by. Unable to complete requested function. Please abort
and retry. <br>
O'BRIEN: Reset subspace emitter. Reinitialise data stream. <br>
COMPUTER: Receptors open control. Relays activated. <br>
O'BRIEN: Upload all probe command sequences back to probe's computers. <br>
COMPUTER: Stand by. <br>
(And the power goes out) <br>
O'BRIEN: It's not as easy as I thought it would be, Commander.

didn't bring any warm clothes. <br>
BASHIR: I'm sure it's just temporary. <br>
LOJAL: I've been reading the reports of your Chief of Operations,
Doctor. They gave me the impression that he was a competent engineer. <br>
BASHIR: Chief O'Brien? One of the best in Starfleet. <br>
LOJAL: Then why aren't the backup systems functioning? <br>

LWAXANA: Yes, of course you are. Is that hair real? <br>
ODO: It is real in that it is me. It is not real hair. <br>
LWAXANA: How did you do it? Your hair. <br>
ODO: It took a great deal of practice. <br>
LWAXANA: You studied hairstyles? <br>
ODO: If you must know, I imitated the hairstyle of the Bajoran man who
was assigned to me. <br>
LWAXANA: Assigned? <br>
ODO: To study me at the research centre. He was a scientist. <br>
LWAXANA: You mean that's how you grew up, in a laboratory? <br>
ODO: I did not grow up as you think of it. It was merely a transition
from what I used to be to what I learned to become. <br>
LWAXANA: Sounds very lonely to me. <br>
ODO: I was always very self-sufficient. <br>
LWAXANA: I'm sure you had to be, to survive, being so different from
everyone else. <br>
ODO: Odo to Ops. Odo to Ops! Comm. lines are still down. I don't know
what's taking so long. <br>
LWAXANA: Are you sure you're all right? You look warm. <br>
ODO: It's nothing. I'm fine. <br>
LWAXANA: I can't imagine how it must have been. If it bothers you to
talk about this? <br>
ODO: Not at all. What was it like? I guess you could say I was the life
of the party. <br>
LWAXANA: I don't think I understand. <br>
ODO: My way of trying to fit in. I found I could be entertaining. Odo,
be a chair. I'm a chair. Odo, be a razorcat. I'm a razorcat. Life of
the party. I hate parties. <br>
LWAXANA: Perhaps you've been going to the wrong ones. Come to one of
mine, Odo. I'll make sure that all the guests are there to entertain
you. (Odo groans) No, you're not well. <br>
ODO: No, it's fine. It's just, I told you I turn into a liquid every

shutting up a puppy up in a room, you know? I had a pup once. If I had
to lock him up, he'd scratch forever at the door, trying to get out. <br>
DAX: I'm not sure I know what you're getting at. <br>
O'BRIEN: Pups don't like to be left alone. They like attention. <br>
DAX: This one's certainly getting a lot of it. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's right, so it's no wonder it doesn't want to leave. <br>
DAX: Okay, but how does that help us? <br>
O'BRIEN: Everything we've seen suggests that this entity likes to be
where the action is. It seems to feed off the energy of an active
computer. We've been trying to separate it from what it thrives on.
We've got to do the exact opposite. <br>
