security personnel and flashes of phaser fire.) <br>
VOICES [OC]: Over this way. <br>
DAX: Who's winning the war? <br>
QUARK: It's too early to tell. <br>
DAX: It's been three days. <br>
QUARK: Don't remind me. They found a nest. <br>
DAX: That's good. <br>
QUARK: It's not the main nest. <br>
DAX: That's not so good. I thought Chief O'Brien trapped the last vole
on the station months ago. <br>
QUARK: Well, obviously he missed a couple. A married couple. They breed
like tribbles. <br>
DAX: But they're not as cute. <br>
QUARK: They're disgusting, hairy little creatures with ravenous
appetites and I want them gone. <br>
DAX: Oh, Quark. <br>
QUARK: I know, I know. This is just a temporary setback. The bar will
open again and I can get back to my life. <br>
DAX: I'm glad you realise that. <br>
QUARK: The only trouble is, I hate my life.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUARK: Come in. <br>
ROM: Hello, brother. <br>
QUARK: What do you want? <br>
ROM: You have every right to be depressed, brother. Ever since you were
blacklisted by the Ferengi Commerce Authority it's been one thing after
another. But I have some news that's going to cheer you up. <br>
QUARK: I doubt it. <br>
ROM: Trust me on this one, brother. I'm about to make you very, very
happy. <br>
QUARK: Really? <br>
ROM: Really. Come on in. <br>
(Leeta enters.) <br>
QUARK: What's she doing here? <br>
ROM: We're getting married. <br>
QUARK: Oh, I wish I was dead. <br>
ROM: He's been a little depressed lately. <br>
QUARK: I don't want to live. <br>
LEETA: I think you need someone to talk to, someone to pamper you. <br>
QUARK: I think I need to be alone. <br>
ROM: You know who I talk to when I'm feeling a little low? <br>
QUARK: Yeah, me. <br>
ROM: Not when it's something really important. <br>
QUARK: Let me guess. Chief O'Brien? <br>
ROM: That's not a bad guess. <br>
QUARK: Rom, just tell me who it is, then you can leave and I can go
back to my brooding. <br>
ROM: There's only one person in my life who's always there for me,
who's never too busy to listen, who reassures me when I'm scared,
comforts me when I'm sad, and who showers me with endless love without
ever asking anything in return. <br>
LEETA: I'd like to meet this person. <br>
QUARK: So would I. <br>
ROM: You already know her. And she'll always be there for you, brother,
with open arms.

ROM: Of all the Bajoran Prophecies, I think my favourite is Horran's
Seventh. The one that starts, He will come to the palace, carrying a
chalice. <br>
DAX: Bearing no malice. <br>
ROM: Overflowing with sweet Spring wine. <br>
O'BRIEN: Someone's been studying the Ancient Texts. <br>
ROM: It's important to Leeta. She wants a traditional Bajoran wedding. <br>
DAX: And you've agreed to it? Oh, that's very sweet, Rom. <br>
O'BRIEN: Is she doing the same for you? I mean, learning to be a
Ferengi woman? Memorising the Rules of Acquisition and <br>
DAX: Not likely. Leeta's not the type of woman to quit her job, stop
wearing clothes, and never go out in public again. <br>
ROM: That's okay. I just want her to be happy. <br>
DAX: That's a very enlightened attitude, Rom. <br>
O'BRIEN: Rom is not your traditional Ferengi male. <br>
ROM: I guess not. <br>
DAX: You're probably the least Ferengi-like Ferengi I've ever met. <br>
ROM: I guess so. <br>
DAX: Oh, that's not a bad thing, Rom. No traditional Ferengi male could
ever marry a non-Ferengi and be happy. He could never trust her.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUARK: So you see, Moogie, the voles aren't the
real problem. They're just a symbol for everything that's gone wrong in
my life. <br>
ISHKA: You've had a tough year, Quark. <br>
QUARK: That's an understatement. I see all these great opportunities
out there and I can't do anything about them. Without a Ferengi
Business Licence it's like I don't exist. <br>
ISHKA: I understand why you felt the need to escape for a while, but
why come here? <br>
QUARK: I had no place else to go. <br>
ISHKA: Are you sure about that? Oh, now don't give me that look. You
and I both know we've never really gotten along. You disapprove of me,
Quark. You always have. Moogie, stop wearing clothes. Moogie, stop
earning profit. <br>
QUARK: You have stopped, haven't you? I mean earning profit. Wearing
clothes is bad enough, but profit. <br>
ISHKA: You see what I mean? <br>
QUARK: I know the two of us living under the same roof isn't going to
be easy. But you're my mother and I love you. <br>
ISHKA: And I love you too, Quark. But when you say living together what
are we talking about? A day? A week? Two weeks? <br>
QUARK: I don't know. I guess until I start feeling better. Unless, of
course, you don't want me. <br>
ISHKA: You're my son. How could I refuse you? <br>
QUARK: Then you'll remove all that unnecessary clothing? <br>
ISHKA: Don't push your luck. Where are you going? <br>
QUARK: To my room. I'm exhausted. <br>
ISHKA: What you need is some of your mother's cooking. Some nice, juicy
tube grubs. <br>
QUARK: I never liked your tube grubs. <br>
ISHKA: I'll pre-chew them for you. <br>
QUARK: Maybe later.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUARK: Hello, room. Where's all my stuff? If she's
thrown out my Marauder Mo action figures. <br>
(Quark opens the wardrobe. Zek and Maihar'du are in there. Quark hands
over his bag and shuts the door. Then his brain registers what his eyes
saw and opens it again.) <br>
QUARK: Grand Nagus? <br>
ZEK: Quark, what are you doing here? <br>
QUARK: I'm visiting my mother. <br>
ZEK: That's no excuse. You've been banned by the FCA. You must leave
Ferenginar at once.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Ishka's house]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUARK: Got to go. The Nagus, he knows I'm here.
Wait a minute. What's the Nagus doing in my closet? <br>
ISHKA: The Nagus? <br>
QUARK: Moogie? <br>
ISHKA: Zekkie! You might as well come out. <br>
QUARK: Zekkie? What's going on? <br>
ISHKA: The next time you visit, I'd really appreciate it if you called
first. <br>
QUARK: That doesn't answer my question. <br>
(Zek and Maihar'du enter) <br>
ZEK: Sometimes, the only thing more dangerous than a question is an
answer. <br>
QUARK: Rule of Acquisition two oh eight. You're in trouble again,
aren't you? What have you done now? Whatever it is, I had nothing to do
with it. Tell him, Moogie. Tell him I'm innocent. <br>
ISHKA: Relax, Quark. I'm not in any trouble. <br>
QUARK: You're not? <br>
ZEK: Why would she be in trouble? <br>
QUARK: I don't know. I just thought since you were here. I don't know
what I thought. I'm so confused. <br>
ZEK: About what? It's all really quite simple. You see, Quark, your
mother and I are in love. <br>
QUARK: How did you two meet? <br>
ISHKA: We met at the Global Tongo Championships. <br>
ZEK: That's right. I was playing in the Golden Masters Division. <br>
ISHKA: And I was tucked away in the sub-basement playing in the Female
Division. Anyway, word leaked down to us that the Grand Nagus was
having a little difficulty with his game. <br>
ZEK: For some reason my purchases kept exceeding my sales. <br>
ISHKA: So I wrote him a note offering some helpful pointers on to firm
up his play. <br>
ZEK: And they worked! I made a spectacular comeback and won the
tournament for the twenty seventh year in a row. <br>
ISHKA: Zekkie sent me a very nice thank you note. Before I knew it, we
were corresponding regularly. <br>
ZEK: Your mother's letters became the highlight of each day. It was
clear we had to meet. <br>
ISHKA: Imagine his surprise when he found out I was a female and your
mother, no less. <br>
ZEK: I almost had a stroke. But I recovered. <br>
ISHKA: And we've been seeing each other ever since. <br>
QUARK: Does anybody know about this? <br>
ZEK: Of course no one knows. And you're going to keep it that way. <br>
QUARK: My lips are sealed. <br>
ZEK: They'd better be. <br>
ISHKA: Jellied gree worms? Maihar'du, you are too good to me. He treats
me like a queen. <br>
ZEK: That's because you deserve no less. <br>
ISHKA: Zekkie, they don't come sweeter than you. <br>
QUARK: I don't believe it. <br>
ZEK: What's that, Quark? <br>
QUARK: Nothing. I've never seen you looking happier. <br>
ZEK: That's because I've never felt happier. Well, my dear, time to get
back to running the empire. Try not to miss me too much. <br>
ISHKA: I miss you already. <br>
ZEK: That's my girl. <br>
ISHKA: Oh, Lobekins. Don't forget your appointment calendar. <br>
(She gives him a PADD) <br>
ZEK: Thank you, my prize. Your mother is a rare jewel, Quark. Worship
her as I do. <br>
(Zek and Maihar'du leave.) <br>
QUARK: Incredible. <br>
ISHKA: Quark, if you're going to give me a hard time about this. <br>
QUARK: Give you a hard time? You and the Nagus? I couldn't be happier
for all of us.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: No sign of a single vole. I think we got
them all. <br>
ROM: Chief, is it all right if I take a slightly longer lunch than
usual? I need Leeta to sign this. <br>
O'BRIEN: The Waiver of Property and Profit? <br>
ROM: Ferengi females aren't allowed to own property or earn profit. The
WP and P states that in the event the marriage ends, the female gives
up all claim to her husband's estate. <br>
O'BRIEN: And you expect Leeta to agree to this? <br>
ROM: I agreed to wear the earring. So either Leeta signs this or the
wedding's off. I may not be a traditional Ferengi but I'm still a
Ferengi. <br>
O'BRIEN: It's your life, but I think you're making a big mistake. <br>
ROM: I think I'd be making a bigger mistake if I didn't. Besides, Leeta
loves me. You'll see, Chief. She'll sign it.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LEETA: Are you crazy? I'm not going to sign this. <br>
ROM: Why not? <br>
LEETA: Because a marriage is about sharing everything, including money.
<br>
ROM: Not on Ferenginar. <br>
LEETA: We're not on Ferenginar. <br>
ROM: But I'm a Ferengi. <br>
LEETA: And I'm not. <br>
ROM: Females and finances don't mix. Rule of Acquisition ninety four. <br>
LEETA: That's a stupid rule. <br>
ROM: It's true. You're just like her. You're after my money. <br>
LEETA: Like who? <br>
ROM: My first wife. Pretending that you care about me but all the time
it's my profits that you really care about. <br>
LEETA: Rom, I love you, not your latinum. <br>
ROM: Then prove it. Sign the WP and P. <br>
LEETA: Never. <br>
ROM: Then the marriage is off. <br>

LEETA: You bet it is.

ZEK: My dear, you reek of tube grubs. <br>
ISHKA: So do you, lobekins. <br>
ZEK: Are your ears tingling? Mine, too. <br>
QUARK: So tell me, Nagus, how was your day? <br>
ZEK: Oh, you know how it is. Arcybite ore futures are continuing to
increase, and the Bolians have finally agreed to allow the Ferengi
Gaming Commission to take over their gambling emporiums, and er, er,
oh, I have decided to allocate extra funds for research on a new breed
of Hupyrian beetles. Those little fellows are going to revolutionise
the entire beetle snuff industry. <br>
ISHKA: Now that's what I call a busy and productive day. <br>
QUARK: No wonder the Ferengi economy is growing at a record pace. Costs
are down, profits are up. <br>
ZEK: And opportunity is around every corner. <br>
ISHKA: Zekkie, you've done quite a job. <br>
QUARK: And your people love you for it. Your business acumen, your
negotiating skills, your kindness and generosity. <br>
ZEK: Forget it, Quark. I'm not going to reverse the FCA's decision.
They revoked your Business Licence and they're the one's who are going
to have to reinstate it. <br>
QUARK: But you're the most powerful man on Ferenginar. You can do
whatever you want. <br>
ZEK: True, but contracts are the very basis of our society and you
broke a contract with another Ferengi. I
