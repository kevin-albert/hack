triangulation on these sector points. <br>
SHIPLEY: Aye, sir. <br>
RIKER: Sorry I'm late. I overslept again. What have we got? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, the cluster's a lot more dense than we thought. It's
going to take three days just to map out one tenth of it. <br>
RIKER: Three days? <br>
LAFORGE: I think we've found a way to speed that up a bit. We've been
testing a way of channelling warp energy directly to the main deflector
grid. It should enhance the long range sensors. <br>
DATA: The modification would increase our sensor efficiency and imaging
resolution by twenty five percent or more. <br>
RIKER: That sounds like that'll use up a lot of warp energy. <br>
LAFORGE: We'd channel it through the EPS mains on deck four, near Cargo
bay four. <br>
RIKER: Okay, let's give it a try. <br>
LAFORGE: Data, let's get those field taps online. <br>
DATA: Commander, I would like to remind you about my poetry reading
this afternoon. <br>
RIKER: I wouldn't miss it for the world. <br>
LAFORGE: I can't wait to see what he's come up with.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Data is giving his recital to a slightly restless
audience) <br>
DATA: Then we sat on the sand for some time and observed <br>
How the oceans that cover the world were perturbed <br>
By the tides from the orbiting moon overhead <br>
'How relaxing the sound of the waves is,' you said. <br>
I began to expound upon tidal effects <br>
When you asked me to stop, looking somewhat perplexed. <br>
So I did not explain why the sunset turns red <br>
And we watched the occurrence, in silence, instead. <br>
(applause) <br>
DATA: That poem was written in anapaestic tetrameter. For my ninth
poem, <br>
RIKER: I don't understand. I can barely keep my eyes open. <br>
DATA: Throughout the ages, from Keats to Jorkemo, poets have composed
odes to individuals who have had a profound effect on their lives. In
keeping with that tradition, I have written my next poem in honour of
my cat. I call it Ode to Spot. <br>
Felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature. <br>
An endothermic quadruped, carnivorous by nature. <br>
Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses <br>
Contribute to your hunting skill and natural defences. <br>
I find myself intrigued by your subvocal oscillations. <br>
A singular development of cat communications <br>
That obviates your basic hedonistic predilection, <br>
For a rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate affection. <br>
A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents. <br>
You would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance. <br>
And when not being utilised to aid in locomotion <br>
It often serves to illustrate the state of your emotions. <br>
(Riker snores, Deanna pokes him awake and he starts clapping) <br>
DATA: Commander, you have anticipated my denouement. However, the
sentiment is appreciated. I will continue. <br>
Oh, Spot, the complex levels of behaviour you display <br>
Connote a fairly well developed cognitive array. <br>
And though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not comprehend <br>
I nonetheless consider you a true and valued friend.

sorry. I've been on edge all day. <br>
CRUSHER: Well. other than some muscle tension in your neck, I don't see
anything physically wrong with you. Have you been having bad dreams? <br>
RIKER: Not that I can remember. <br>
CRUSHER: This could be the result of lack of REM sleep. <br>
RIKER: What do you recommend? <br>

CRUSHER: Drink this before going to bed. <br>
RIKER: What is it? <br>
CRUSHER: A recipe for a warm milk toddy. <br>
RIKER: A hot milk toddy? You're kidding. <br>
CRUSHER: The heat activates amino acids in the lactose, making it a
natural sedative. Besides, this is a recipe of the Captain's Aunt
Adelle. It's delicious. <br>

reading. <br>
LAFORGE: Sure, Data. What is it? <br>
DATA: I noticed that many spectators seemed distracted during my
presentation. Was my poetry uninteresting? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, it was very well constructed, a virtual tribute to form.
<br>
DATA: Thank you. And? <br>
LAFORGE: And what? <br>
DATA: Did it evoke an emotional response? <br>
LAFORGE: Well. <br>
DATA: Your hesitation suggests you are trying to protect my feelings.
However, since I have none, I would prefer you to be honest. An
artist's growth depends upon accurate feedback. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, your poems were clever, Data, and your Haiku was clever,
and your sonnet was clever. But did it evoke an emotional response? To
be honest, no, I don't think so. <br>
DATA: Then I did not succeed in my efforts. <br>
LAFORGE: No, it's not that you didn't succeed. You accomplished a lot,
but, if you want to touch people, don't concentrate so much on rhyme
and metre. Think more about what you want to say instead of how you're
saying it. <br>

sensors before but nothing like this has ever happened. <br>

probably keep the whole array offline until we can get take a closer

level. The metal itself is in a state of quasi-molecular flux. <br>
PICARD: What's causing it? <br>
LAFORGE: This is where it gets a little wild, Captain. Behind that
panel is a junction we were using to transfer
warp power to the sensor array. We're reading a subspace particle
stream emanating from that junction. <br>
DATA: It appears to be composed of spatially inverted tetryon
particles. We believe they are emanating from a tertiary subspace
manifold. <br>
PICARD: But I thought that tetryons were unstable in normal space. <br>
LAFORGE: We don't understand it either, sir. Something from that deep
in subspace shouldn't be able to exist in our universe. But there it
is. <br>
PICARD: Does it pose a danger to the ship? <br>
LAFORGE: Not unless it spreads. If it does, we can beam the bulkhead
into space and erect a forcefield in its place. <br>

SHIPLEY: Take a look at this. <br>
(there's a glow in the middle of the bay, and the bit on the wall is
brighter too.) <br>
LAFORGE: Data, the tetryon emissions have intensified. They seem to be
focusing in this direction, coalescing here. They're reading as a point
of subspace energy. <br>
DATA: It appears to be the beginnings of a spatial rupture. <br>
LAFORGE: The tetryon emissions are modulating in a way that looks like
somebody's controlling the energy. You know, the signals from the
modifications I made to the sensor array, some of them dig pretty deep
into subspace. Maybe they caught somebody's attention. <br>
DATA: At the rate the rupture is expanding, we will soon be in danger
of hull breach. <br>
LAFORGE: Maybe we should try surrounding it with a subspace containment
field. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: We've set up a containment field in cargo
bay four, but the rupture just keeps expanding. I'd say we've got
another five or six hours before it breaches the hull. <br>
PICARD: Can we still beam the affected sections out into space? <br>
DATA: No, sir. The spatial rupture is creating severe nucleonic
interference. It is impossible to obtain a positive lock on the
bulkheads. <br>
PICARD: Has your analysis suggested any way in which we might seal this
rupture? <br>
LAFORGE: We think we can close the rupture by neutralising the tetryon
emissions with a coherent graviton pulse. But we'd have to do that at
the source. <br>
RIKER: How do we find the source? <br>
LAFORGE: Good question. The emissions are coming from a tertiary
subspace domain, but subspace has an infinite number of domains. It's
like a huge honeycomb with an endless number of cells. We need to
isolate the exact cell that these emissions are coming from. <br>
PICARD: If someone homed onto the subspace signals created by our
modified signal array, could we do the same to them? Track the tetryon
emissions to their universe? <br>
DATA: Tetryon particles have a random momentum. Our sensors cannot
track them, sir. <br>
WORF: Perhaps we could construct a homing device. Something that our
sensors could track. <br>
LAFORGE: That's a good idea, but there's no way to get that device to
the source. <br>
RIKER: Yes, there is. Give it to me. They've taken me for the last few
nights. If I'm right, the same thing'll happen tonight. <br>
LAFORGE: If you had a homing device, we could track it to your location
in subspace. And as soon as they send you back to the ship, we could
transmit the graviton pulse and neutralise the tetryon emissions. <br>
TROI: If they send him back. Ensign Rager still hasn't been returned. <br>
RIKER: They're going to take me whether I want to go or not. <br>
PICARD: Well, we could wait as long as possible for you to be returned,
Number One, but when the spatial ruptures begin to threaten the ship,
then we would have to transmit that graviton pulse. <br>
RIKER: Understood. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps there's a way that we could give you an advantage. A
way of keeping you conscious after they have taken you. Doctor, can you
develop some counter-agent to the neuro-sedative that they have been
giving the crew? <br>
CRUSHER: I could give you a neuro-stimulant, but the dosage would have
to be rather high
to counteract the effects. It could be risky. <br>
RIKER: I'm willing to take that risk. <br>
PICARD: Make it so. Mister La Forge, begin work on that homing device.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: This should be enough to ward off their

RIKER: I hope it's enough. <br>
CRUSHER: It's going to have to be. I can't risk giving you a higher
dosage. <br>
LAFORGE: I've locked this tricorder into a continuous cycle. That way,
it'll keep recording whether you open it or not. Hopefully you can
bring back some information about their domain. We've modified a sensor
relay emitter to transmit a subspace beacon. When this indicator lights
up, it means that we've locked onto your location. <br>
