NEELIX: Oh, you look like a man who could use more coffee. <br>
KIM: Keep it coming. I'm working on my monthly ops report. So much has
happened in the last few weeks on this ship, I'm going to be up all
night. <br>
NEELIX: This firenut blend should keep you eyes open. <br>
KIM: Potent stuff! Thanks. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: Yes. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I know you have your hands full this evening, but I could use
your help. <br>
NEELIX: At your service, Commander. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We're approaching a class one nebula. Sensors are picking up
traces of protomatter inside. I understand you've dealt with it before?
<br>
NEELIX: Absolutely. When I was making my living as a trader.
Protomatter's one of the most sought-after commodities. It's the best energy
source in the Quadrant. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We could use your expertise in collecting a sample. We're
leaving at fourteen hundred hours. See you in the shuttlebay? <br>

These nutritional supplements are unacceptable. <br>(Seven is holding a tray of limp leaves and other vegetables.)<br>
NEELIX: What's wrong? <br>
SEVEN: They are pungent. <br>
NEELIX: That's the whole idea. I've been adding Talaxian spices to
broaden your palette. <br>
SEVEN: My palette is sufficiently broad. <br>
NEELIX: Why settle for sufficient? The Doctor tells me you have a full
complement of taste buds. You've hardly begun to use them. Come by the
mess hall Thursday night. It's the first day of Prixin. We'll have an
impressive array of exotic cuisine. <br>
SEVEN: Prixin? <br>
NEELIX: The Talaxian celebration of family. We observe it every year on
Voyager. Now that you're part of the family<br>
SEVEN: What should I do to prepare? <br>
NEELIX: Nothing. It's not a mission, Seven, it's a party. <br>
WILDMAN [OC]: Ensign Wildman to Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: Neelix here. <br>
WILDMAN [OC]: I hate to bother you, but Naomi's having trouble getting
to sleep again. Would you mind? <br>
NEELIX: No bother at all. I'm on my way. If you'll excuse me, duty
calls. <br>
SEVEN: Naomi? I don't recall that designation on the crew manifest. <br>
NEELIX: That's because she's not a member of the crew. Naomi was the
first child born on Voyager. I'm her godfather, and the only one who can
get her to sleep lately. Bon app√©tit. </font></p>

NEELIX: It's all right. You know what I think about when I'm afraid to
go to sleep?<br>
NAOMI: No. What? <br>
NEELIX: The Great Forest. <br>
NAOMI: What's that? <br>
NEELIX: It's a place my people believe we're all going to go to
someday. It's a beautiful, beautiful forest filled with sunlight, and
all the people who ever loved me are gathered there to watch over me as
I sleep, to protect me. <br>
NAOMI: Really? <br>
NEELIX: When I think about that Forest and those people, I'm not afraid
to sleep anymore. <br>
NAOMI: Do you think those people watch over me too? <br>
NEELIX: I know they do. Now, I'm going to be away for the next couple

Cylinder. <br>(Seven steps out of her alcove.)<br>NEELIX: Oh! Sorry. I didn't realise you were home. <br>
SEVEN: I was regenerating. <br>
NEELIX: I see. <br>
SEVEN: Do you require assistance? <br>
NEELIX: No, no, no. I have a small containment cylinder stored here.
I'll just be a minute. Cylinder? Little cylinder, where are you?
Cylinder, you were here a month ago. Now I know that you didn't just
roll out of the airlock all by yourself. Now where are you? Oh, I'm
sorry. I'm talking to myself. It's my way of remembering things. <br>
SEVEN: You are a peculiar creature, Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: Thanks. I think. Ah! Here it is. Oh, this will be perfect for
containing a small amount of protomatter. Last time I used this little
wonder I nearly lost it to the Kazon. <br>
SEVEN: The Kazon. Species three two nine. <br>
NEELIX: You're familiar with them. <br>
SEVEN: The Borg encountered a Kazon colony in the Gand Sector, grid six
nine two zero. <br>
NEELIX: Were they assimilated? <br>
SEVEN: Their biological and technological distinctiveness was
unremarkable. They were unworthy of assimilation. <br>
NEELIX: I didn't realise the Borg were so discriminating. <br>
SEVEN: Why assimilate a species that would detract from perfection? <br>
NEELIX: Good point. Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm needed in the
shuttlebay. Pleasant regenerating. </font></p>

One day a week, that's all I ask. How hard can it be? <br>
NEELIX: Harder than you think. <br>
PARIS: Neelix, it's pizza. Bread, tomatoes, cheese <br>
NEELIX: The cheese alone would take days. Separating curds and whey
from synthesised milk. It's a delicate process. <br>
PARIS: So replicate the cheese. <br>
NEELIX: Since it means so much to you, I'll see what I can do. <br>
PARIS: Thanks. There's a concentration of protomatter directly ahead. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Neelix? <br>
NEELIX: Set the transporter for ten thousand amu's, not a particle
more. The containment field is standing by. <br>
PARIS: We're in range. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Energising. <br>(Energy flares from the pillar of gas in the nebula. One hits the shuttlecraft.)<br>CHAKOTAY: What happened? <br>
PARIS: The transporter beam ignited the protomatter. Shields are weakening.
<br>
CHAKOTAY: Disengage transport. <br>
PARIS: Shields are down.<br>(Neelix' cylinder is filled with glowing green.) <br>
NEELIX: I've got the sample, Commander, and it's stable. <br>(An
energy blast strikes Neelix in the chest, throwing him backwards. Paris
goes to him while Chakotay flies them out of danger.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: We're clear of the protomatter. How's Neelix? <br>
PARIS: He's dead. No heart beat, no synaptic response, extensive cell
damage to his brain. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Try a cortical stimulator. <br>
PARIS: It won't work. His neural pathways were disrupted by the
protomatter. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Set the stimulator for an autonomic bypass. At least we can
get his vitals going. <br>
PARIS: It's too late for that. The damage was too severe. <br>(Bang!)<br>
CHAKOTAY: We're running into more protomatter. I need your help. </font></p>

Captain, I'm detecting the shuttle. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH: I
ran a complete postmortem analysis. There was nothing you could have
done. <br>
PARIS: I knew we were too close to the protomatter. I should have said
something. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Nobody could have predicted this, Tom. <br>
EMH: How shall I proceed? <br>
JANEWAY: The Talaxians mourn their dead for a full week, in a specific
burial ceremony. And that's just what we're going to do. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'll inform the crew. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll check Neelix's personal database, see what I can find out
about the ceremony. We'll have it in the mess hall. Somehow that feels
appropriate. <br>(Seven enters.)<br>
SEVEN: Neelix is dead? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm afraid so. <br>
SEVEN: His neural pathways, are they intact? <br>
EMH: Yes, but there's no metabolic activity. <br>
SEVEN: How long has he been dead? <br>
JANEWAY: Seven, I understand <br>
SEVEN: How long? <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's been eighteen hours. <br>
SEVEN: Then it's not too late to reactivate him. <br>
PARIS: What are you saying? You can bring Neelix back to life? <br>
SEVEN: That's precisely what I'm saying. The Borg have assimilated
species with far greater medical knowledge than your own. We are
capable of reactivating drones as much as seventy three hours after
what you would call death. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Neelix wasn't a Borg drone. <br>
SEVEN: We will adapt. <br>
EMH: What does this procedure involve? <br>
SEVEN: Nanoprobes are used to reverse cellular necrosis, while the
cerebral cortex is stimulated with a neuroelectric isopulse. <br>
EMH: But there's nothing left to stimulate. His brain functions are
gone. <br>
SEVEN: By your narrow definition, perhaps, but not by mine. You will
extract seventy micrograms of nanoprobes from my bloodstream. I will
modify them to match his Talaxian physiology. His function in this crew
is diverse. If you wish to salvage him we must proceed immediately. <br>
PARIS: I say we let her try. <br>
JANEWAY: Hold on a minute, Tom, please. No one's ever been resuscitated
after being dead for eighteen hours. If this procedure does work, what
are the chances that Neelix would come out of it unaffected? <br>
EMH: She's right. The damage to his cerebral cortex was severe. <br>
SEVEN: The nanoprobes will compensate for any cellular degradation.
Captain, a decision has to be made quickly. <br>
JANEWAY: Doctor, give Seven whatever assistance she needs. Proceed. <br>
EMH: Captain <br>
JANEWAY: Do it. If there's a chance we can revive Neelix, we're got to
take it. Keep me informed. <br>(Later -)<br>SEVEN:
The nanoprobes are ready. We should begin. <br>
EMH: Hold on. I want to check his blood viscosity. <br>
SEVEN: The cadaver has been sufficiently prepared. <br>
EMH: And they say I have a lousy bedside manner. <br>(Seven injects Neelix with the nanoprobes.)<br>
SEVEN: Set neuroelectric isopulses for one second intervals. <br>
EMH: Ready. <br>
SEVEN: Now. <br>(Neelix jerks. Biomedical scan 0208 shows the results.)<br>SEVEN: Neural activity at nine percent, ten percent, twelve
percent. <br>
EMH: This is incredible. His intracerebral blood pressure, his synaptic
responses, they're all returning to normal. <br>
SEVEN: The alveoli in his lung are regenerating. They should be
functional <br>(Neelix takes a breath.)<br>SEVEN: Now. Neural activity at fifty two percent and rising. <br>(Neelix starts to fit.)<br>
EMH: His neurotransmitter levels are rising too fast. <br>
SEVEN: We must stabilise his motor neurones. <br>
EMH: I'm going to try reducing his acetocholine levels. It might be
enough to<br>
NEELIX: Doctor. <br>(Neelix has sat up.)<br>
EMH: Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: What happened. What happened? Why am, why am I here? <br>(The EMH makes Neelix lie down again. Seven looks smug. And later -)<br>NEELIX:
Dead? <br>
EMH: For eighteen hours, forty nine minutes, thirteen seconds.
Congratulations, Mister Neelix. You've just set a new world record. <br>
NEELIX: That's impossible. You mean I lost consciousness. I was, I was in a
coma. <br>
SEVEN: No. You were dead. <br>
NEELIX: I'm stunned. I'm amazed. I'm grateful. Thank you, Doctor. <br>
JANEWAY: Actually, you can thank Seven of Nine. The procedure was her
idea. <br>
NEELIX: Yours? <br>
SEVEN: The Borg have assimilated the technique from species one four
nine. I simply modified it. But you are welcome. <br>
NEELIX: Am I good as new? <br>
EMH: That remains to be seen. There's no way to tell if your body will
successfully take over the functions the nanoprobes are serving. <br>
NEELIX: Nanoprobes? <br>
JANEWAY: It was necessary, to repair the necrotised tissue. <br>
EMH: Until I'm certain the damaged tissue can function independently,
you'll have to be injected with nanoprobes on a daily basis. <br>
NEELIX: Well, as long as I don't start assimilating the crew or
sprouting Borg implants, I'm sure I can live with it. <br>
EMH: I'm releasing you to your quarters. Your body's been through quite
a shock, so try to get some rest. Report to Sickbay tomorrow at oh eight
hundred hours for your next injection. </font></p>

The shuttle mission, was it a success? Did we get the protomatter? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm afraid not. The sample you collected destabilised before
it got back to Voyager. <br>
NEELIX: The containment field needs to be reinforced next time. <br>
JANEWAY: If there is a next time. I've asked Chakotay to find out
exactly what caused the accident, and unless we can take additional
precautions I'm not sending another team into that nebula. <br>
NEELIX: I could help with that investigation. <br>
JANEWAY: No. You are taking some time off, and that's an order. <br>
NEELIX: No, Captain, please. I don't need any special treatment. <br>
JANEWAY: Neelix, you've just returned from the dead. Go easy on
yourself. <br>
NEELIX: Yes, I suppose you're right. Oh, but you can't ask me to cancel
the first night of Prixin. The celebration is in three days. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, I almost forgot. <br>
NEELIX: I've been aging fruit compote in moolt nectar for weeks now. I
can't just let it go to waste. <br>
JANEWAY: Only if you feel up to it. Could you not ferment those
compotes so long this time, because last year I got a little light-headed.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> SEVEN:
Human attitudes toward death are perplexing. <br>
TUVOK: How so? <br>
SEVEN: Too much importance is placed on it. There seem to be countless
rituals and cultural beliefs designed to alleviate their fear of a
simple biological truth. All organisms eventually perish. <br>
TUVOK: I take it the Borg have no fear of that biological truth. <br>
SEVEN: None. When a drone is damaged beyond repair, it is discarded. But
it's memories continue to exist in the Collective consciousness. To use
a human term, the Borg are immortal. <br>
TUVOK: You are no longer part of the Collective. You are mortal now
like the rest of us. Does that disturb you? <br>
SEVEN: My connection to the Borg has been severed, but the Collective
still possesses my recollections, my experiences. In a sense, I will
always exist. <br>

NEELIX: I died, and there was nothing. There was no one there. No
Forest. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Forest? <br>
NEELIX: The Great Forest. The afterlife. I was taught that when I died
my ancestors would be there, waiting for me by the Guiding Tree. My
sisters, my mother and father, my cousings. Everyone who was killed in the war. I
took great comfort in knowing that we'd all be together again one day. But
it's not true. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe we pulled you back before any of that could happen. <br>
NEELIX: No. I was dead for eighteen hours. I should have experienced
something, should remember something. It's just a story, a myth. There
is no Guiding Tree. No gathering of the ancestors. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You can't be certain of that. Don't throw away a lifetime of
faith because of one anomalous incident. Death is still the greatest
mystery there is. <br>

requested that I commence the celebration with the traditional
salutation. We do not stand alone. We are in the arms of family.
Father, mother, sister, brother. Father's father, father's mother,
father's brother, mother's brother. Suffice to say, the list is
extensive. We gather on this day to extol the warmth and joy of those
unshakable bonds. Without them, we could not call ourselves complete.
On this day, we are thankful to be together. We do not stand alone. <br>

and we were all happy. <br>
NEELIX: Sounds like a nice dream. <br>
NAOMI: It was beautiful. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Neelix is clearing up after the party. Seven enters.)<br>SEVEN:
The Doctor asked me to run a haemotological scan. <br>
NEELIX: Why? <br>
SEVEN: To regulate the dosage of nanoprobes for your next injection. <br>
NEELIX: Go ahead. How much longer will I be needing these injections? <br>
SEVEN: Till your damaged cells can function on their own. <br>
NEELIX: I don't really like the idea of Borg technology swimming around
inside me. <br>
SEVEN: That is irrelevant. You need the nanoprobes to live. <br>
NEELIX: Live? Oh, is that what I am doing right now? Living? I'm
beginning to wonder. <br>
SEVEN: By most definitions you are alive. <br>
NEELIX: Well, part of me isn't alive. <br>
SEVEN: Which part are you referring to? <br>
NEELIX: I don't know, but something is missing. I don't feel like
Neelix anymore. Maybe Neelix is gone? Maybe he died, and I'm all that's
left. <br>
SEVEN: Stop moving and allow me to complete the scan. <br>
NEELIX: I didn't ask to be bought back! <br>
SEVEN: You were dead at the time. <br>
NEELIX: Well, what right did you have to violate me? You Borg think you
can fix anything but you didn't fix me! <br>
SEVEN: There was no alternative. <br>
NEELIX: Get out. Just leave me alone! I said get out! <br>
SEVEN: I would be negligent in my duties if I did that. <br>
NEELIX: I don't care about your duties. I don't care <br>(Neelix gasps, and gropes his way to a seat.)<br>NEELIX: What's, what's
happening to me? <br>
SEVEN: Your cells are returning to a necrotic state. We must get you to Sickbay. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
His tissue began rejecting the nanoprobes, causing spontaneous necrosis
throughout his body. <br>
SEVEN: We modified the nanoprobes to compensate and it appears to be
working. Neelix is stable, for now.<br>
JANEWAY: How do we know this won't happen again? <br>
EMH: We don't. I've designed a monitor for Neelix to wear that will
alert us at the first sign of necrosis, and we'll continue with the
daily injections. Beyond that, I'm afraid it's a matter of maintenance.
He may have to live with this condition for the rest of his life. He
wants to speak with you, Commander. <br>(Chakotay goes to Neelix' bedside.)<br>
NEELIX: Commander, you said if I ever needed anything? You once told me
your people have technology that can induce a deep meditation, an
altered state of consciousness. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The akoonah. <br>
NEELIX: That this device allows you to look inside yourself, ask
questions that you might otherwise be afraid to ask. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's right. <br>
NEELIX: That's what I need. I need to look inside myself, figure out
what's happening to me. I need answers. Will you help me, Commander? <br>
CHAKOTAY: All right. But I want you to understand, the vision quest
isn't a quick fix. It'll take time to interpret the images, and there's
no guarantee you'll find what you're looking for. <br>
NEELIX: I understand. What should I do to prepare? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You'll need a medicine bundle. Items that define you. Things
that will ground you, allow you to take the journey into yourself. <br>
NEELIX: I'll get ready. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Neelix's quarters]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(A pendant of beads is placed on the skin.)<br>NEELIX:
This belonged to my sister, Alixia. She made it during her expedition
to the dunes of Talmouth. A flower from Kes' garden. And last but not
least, the Guiding Tree. It stands at the centre of Talaxian afterlife,
deep inside the Great Forest. It's there to help us find our way when
we first arrive. At least, that's what I used to believe. Not a very
impressive medicine bundle, is it? <br>
CHAKOTAY: It'll do fine. Now place your hand on the akoonah. <br>
NEELIX: Am I doing this right? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Try to relax. Clear your mind of everything but the objects
before you. Focus on them. Nothing else exists. A-koo-chee-moya. We are
far from the sacred places of our grandfathers. We are far from the
bones of our people. We come here seeking guidance. It's time, Neelix.
Try to leave this room, this ship, and go to a place where you were the
most peaceful and content you have ever been. That's where your journey
will begin. </font></p>

Neelix. Good to have you back. <br>
NEELIX: it's good to be back, Lieutenant. <br>(Neelix sees a Talaxian woman talking to Janeway.)<br>NEELIX: Alixia? Alixia, it's me,
Neelix. Over here. (But his way is blocked by other people. When he reaches Janeway, she is alone.)<br>NEELIX: Captain! My sister, she was just standing here
talking to you. <br>
JANEWAY: The dead girl. Oh yes, very charming. I can see the family
resemblance. <br>
NEELIX: Alixia! <br>(Alixia leaves the mess hall. Neelix tries to follow her, but is stopped by Seven.)<br>

the sunlight, and everyone who ever loved you. <br>
NEELIX: When I died, I looked for you, but you weren't there. Why
weren't you there? <br>
ALIXIA: Because it's all a lie. <br>
NEELIX: What do you mean? <br>
ALIXIA: You've wasted your entire life believing lies. The Great
Forest? The afterlife? It's all created out of your fear of death. None
of it's real. <br>
NEELIX: If that's true, what's the point of living? <br>
ALIXIA: There isn't any. That's what you're finally starting to
realise. (Naomi's voice) I'm afraid to go to sleep. tell me about the
Great Forest, Neelix. Tell me about the trees, and the grass, and all
the people who loved you! <br>
NEELIX: Why are you saying these things? <br>
ALIXIA [Naomi's voice]: Scared you! <br>(Alixia crumbles to dust. The sky darkens. Neelix walks to a stone slab and pulls the sheet back to reveal&nbsp;his dead self.)<br>

should have brought you back. It was a mistake, and you know it. Now

SEVEN: No apology is necessary. <br>
NEELIX: No, no, please. My behaviour was uncalled for. I didn't mean the
things I said. I wasn't myself. But I feel much better now. Commander
Chakotay has helped me to understand a few things. I want you to know
that I don't blame you for bringing me back. To life, I mean. In fact,
what you did was very thoughtful. <br>
SEVEN: I would have done the same for any member of this crew. <br>
NEELIX: Yes, I'm sure you would have. <br>
SEVEN: Is there something else? <br>
NEELIX: No. Yes. Seven, I think you've made a wonderful addition to
this crew. I know it's been difficult for you making the transition
from Borg back to human. Or half human. Or whatever it is you've become.
Actually, you're just plain Seven to me. <br>
SEVEN: Your point, Mister Neelix? <br>
NEELIX: I guess I just want to say. You're surrounded by people who
care about you, and whether you know it or not Voyager is going to be a
very good home to you. It certainly was to me. <br>

NEELIX: I'm sorry I had to cancel our little chat, but I was needed in
the mess hall. I've been so busy the last few days, I've let things slip
around here. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You're not holding up your end of the bargain. <br>
NEELIX: What do you mean? <br>

Forest. I feel a sense of peace I've never felt in my entire life. It
worked. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You've only lived with the visions for a couple of days.
That's not enough time to draw any conclusions. You've got to reflect
on the images, examine them. Allow them to stay alive in your mind. A
vision quest isn't just a dream you dismiss after your first cup of
coffee. <br>
NEELIX: I understand. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Good. I get off duty at fourteen hundred hours. Meet me in my

And finally, Mister Tuvok. I'm grateful for the opportunity I had to
win your respect. Your strength and your wisdom were an inspiration to
me, and I can only hope that your memory of me will serve to inspire
you in some way. It was an honour to spend my last years on Voyager,

NEELIX: No closer! I've created a site to site transport. No one can
override the signal. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You told me you were at peace. <br>
NEELIX: I will be, as soon as I tap this control. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What really happened in your vision quest? What did you see? <br>
NEELIX: My sister, the crew, myself. They all told me the same thing.
There's no point in living. And I agree with them. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm sure those were powerful images, but there are many ways
to interpret them. You may be coming face to face with your own fear of
death. Or the manifestation of your emotional crisis. Your deepest
beliefs have been thrown into doubt. It's only natural the vision quest
would reflect that. <br>
NEELIX: Eleven years ago, I saw my world in ruins, my family murdered.
All that's kept me going is knowing that one day we'd be together
again. That I'd see them again. But it's not true. And I can't live
without that hope. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I understand that this can change how you look at things, but
it can also lead to an even stronger faith. You don't know. You're not
there yet. <br>

CHAKOTAY: Answer her! <br>
WILDMAN [OC]: Neelix, please respond. <br>
NEELIX: No. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You're being called back to your life again, Neelix. Don't
turn your back on it. We're your family now. <br>
NEELIX: It's not enough. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It is for us. His function on this crew is diverse. That's
what Seven of Nine said about you. Even our Borg understands how
important you are on this ship. It's not just the duties you perform,
it's the way you make people feel when you're around. <br>
NEELIX: That Neelix is gone. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't think he is. <br>(Wildman enters.)<br>
WILDMAN: Why didn't you answer me? I had to have the computer track you
down. Naomi thought she saw a monster in the replicator. Neelix, what's
going on? <br>
NEELIX: I'm trying to decide some things. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That little girl needs you, Neelix. Monsters in the
replicator? Who else on this ship can handle that? <br>(Neelix thinks about it, then turns off his tricorder and hands it to Chakotay.) <br>
