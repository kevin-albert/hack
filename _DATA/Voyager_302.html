50203.1. We're three days away from Enara Prime, home of the passengers
we picked up from a colony in the Fima system. Our high warp capability
has greatly reduced the time it normally takes them to make the journey
home. In return, the Enarans have shared their energy conservation
technology with us and, perhaps more importantly, their friendship. </font>

is talking with a female Enaran.) <br>
TORRES: You've never been there? <br>
JESSEN: Well, the trip back to the homeland usually takes so long. I
don't to see it that badly. I've spent my whole life in the Fima
colony, and I've always considered it my home. <br>
(An old woman approaches them.) <br>
MIRELL: You'll change your mind when you see the Danius cliffs at dawn.
<br>
JESSEN: Yes, I've heard they're beautiful. <br>
MIRELL: You'll know what beautiful truly means when you stand on the
cliffs on a rainy morning and watch the raindrops turn to mist when
they hit the molten sea. <br>
TORRES: That sounds wonderful. <br>
JESSEN: It looks like our new components are still slightly out of sync
with your EPS system. <br>
TORRES: I can't isolate it. We'll have to check through all of them. <br>
JESSEN: Maybe Harry could give us a hand? <br>
TORRES: Well, I'm sure he would if you asked him. Harry, you got a
minute? <br>
KIM: Sure. <br>
JESSEN: Could you help us check the modified power relays? There's a
minor flow problem. <br>
KIM: I'd be happy to help. <br>
TORRES: Good. Then we'll get started first thing in the morning. <br>
KIM: Well, if we're done for the night, maybe we could go get something
to eat. <br>
MIRELL: Thank you, but I'll be headed back to bed. I'm sure you young
people will manage without me. Goodnight. <br>
JESSEN: Goodnight. <br>
KIM: So, I guess it'll just be the three of us. <br>
TORRES: Actually, getting some rest sounded like a pretty good idea.
Why don't you go on without me. <br>
(Kim and Jessen leave.) <br>
TORRES: No, really, I insist. </font></p>

TORRES: What. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Your duty shift started twenty minutes ago. I tried to reach
you on the comm. but you didn't answer. <br>
TORRES: I guess, I guess I must have slept right through it. Sorry. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Are you feeling all right? <br>
TORRES: Yes, of course. I'll be there in a minute. </font></p>

CHAKOTAY: This is the second morning you've been late. <br>
TORRES: I'll make up the time. It won't happen again. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm not concerned about the duty schedule, B'Elanna. If
there's something wrong <br>
TORRES: I'm fine. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Ah, you mean fine like when you insisted on finishing the
hoverball championship with a broken ankle? <br>
TORRES: I mean there's nothing wrong. I was only late because I've been
having these dreams. They're very intense, that's all. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
CHAKOTAY: Intensely bad? <br>
TORRES: No, just the opposite. <br>
CHAKOTAY: So they're enjoyable. Stimulating. <br>
TORRES: They are the most sensual dreams I've ever had in my life. And
they feel absolutely real. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't suppose you've been dreaming about anyone in
particular? <br>
TORRES: Nobody you know. Actually, he's nobody I know, either. He's
Enaran. <br>
CHAKOTAY: One of our passengers? <br>
TORRES: No. No. In the dreams, I know him. More than that, I'm in love
with him. Oh, but it's not really me in the dream, it's somebody else
entirely. In a way, it's liberating. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm sure. So I assume I won't have to write up a report on
your chronic oversleeping? <br>
TORRES: If you say a word about this to anyone <br>
CHAKOTAY: I know. You'll rip my heart out and eat it raw. Your secret's
safe with me. </font></p>

smart casual wear, coming out of the turbolift.) <br>
KIM: So what exactly is this big surprise? <br>
PARIS: All I know is that Neelix has been working on it all afternoon.
He wouldn't even let me in there to get a snack. </font></p>

place has been transformed. The tables and chairs are gone, replaced
with cushions and drapes.) <br>
NEELIX: Welcome to Enara! <br>
PARIS: It's very colourful. <br>
NEELIX: Specifically the colours of the Enaran flag. The decor, the
menu, the music, all authentically Enaran. <br>
KIM: What happened to the tables and chairs? <br>
NEELIX: Enarans don't use them. After a big meal, you can just lie back
and take a nap. Very practical. <br>
PARIS: It's a little cold in here, isn't it? <br>
NEELIX: Perhaps a bit chillier than you're used to, but just about
perfect for <br>
PARIS: The Enarans. I got it. <br>
NEELIX: You must try some of these delightful algae puffs. They're
fresh from the oven. <br>
JESSEN: Harry. <br>
KIM: Maybe later. <br>
(Kim goes to sit next to Jessen. They are all listening to a man
running his fingers over a large hemisphere in a piece of carved wood,
similar in size and shape to a ukulele.) <br>
JANEWAY: That was wonderful. What a lovely piece of music. <br>
BREL: You should thank Jora Mirell. She composed it. <br>
MIRELL: I still think you're rushing the harmonics in the second
movement. <br>
JANEWAY: I love music. I've always regretted that I never learnt to
play an instrument. <br>
BREL: I'd be glad to help you if you like. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd like it very much. I'm sure I could find time for a few
lessons. <br>
(Janeway takes the instrument and runs her fingers over the dome,
producing a tune. She doesn't know that Jor Brel is holding his hand
out flat just behind her back. Suddenly, Janeway gasps and stops.) <br>
TUVOK: Captain! <br>
JANEWAY: I'm all right. <br>
BREL: I did understand you correctly, that you wanted to share my
knowledge of music? <br>
JANEWAY: I didn't realise you were offering to share it so directly.
The sensation was a little overwhelming. <br>
BREL: I am terribly sorry, Captain. I assumed since you knew about our
telepathic abilities, I. I never would have dreamed of making a
connection without your consent. <br>
JANEWAY: You intended to give me a gift, and it was wonderful. <br>
TUVOK: Your abilities allow you to transfer knowledge from your own
mind to another's? <br>
BREL: Not precisely. We're able to share our experiences through a
telepathic link. <br>
JANEWAY: I remembered lessons, and hours of practice. Were those all
your experiences? <br>
TUVOK: Intriguing. <br>
JANEWAY: Remarkable. <br>
(Over by the counter, Chakotay has picked up a pair of small metal
balls from a bowl.) <br>
NEELIX: You take a couple of these, roll them around like this, and
voila! Your hands are clean and disinfected. The Enarans are very
hygienic. I haven't seen Lieutenant Torres around here tonight. I
suppose she's putting in another late night in Engineering. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Actually, I think she might have gone to bed early tonight. </font></p>

(Korenna is getting a lecture from her father.) <br>
JARETH: I'm not one to dictate who your friends are, but I'm sure you
can see as clearly as I can that some friends are less suitable than
others. <br>
TORRES: Like Dathan? <br>
JARETH: Yes. You promised you wouldn't see him anymore and then I heard
you were talking to him again the other day. <br>
TORRES: He came up to me on the street. I couldn't help it. <br>
JARETH: Korenna, don't you see I am thinking of him as well as you? Now
you only encourage him this way and that isn't very fair, is it? <br>
TORRES: What isn't fair is that you treat him like everybody else. He's
different. If you'd just talk to him you'd understand that. <br>
JARETH: You know, one of the things I love about you most is your
compassion for others. But you're still young, and you don't realise
that there are some people who might take advantage of that compassion.
Now, I want you to promise me if he comes up to you again you'll just
walk away. That should be clear enough. <br>
TORRES: I'm sure. <br>
JARETH: And finish your tarin juice. It's good for you. <br>
(Torres/Korenna takes a mouthful of the blue liquid and he leaves.) <br>
TORRES: He's gone. <br>
(Dathan comes out from behind the bathroom curtain.) <br>
DATHAN: I should go. <br>
TORRES: He's leaving for work soon. It's safer to wait. <br>
DATHAN: You know, this will only encourage me. <br>
TORRES: I hope so! <br>
(Dathan nuzzles her neck, then Torres becomes alarmed and pushes him
away. Dathan's face is burnt. Torres wakes up in fright.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
We've completed the modifications on the primary EPS conduits. I have a
crew starting on the backup systems. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Can you get it done before we drop off the Enarans? <br>
TORRES: Yes. We'll have to pull some longer shifts, but two more days
should do it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Is there something else on your mind? <br>
TORRES: Those dreams I've been having, they're getting kind of strange.
<br>
CHAKOTAY: In what way? <br>
TORRES: Last night, in the middle of the dream, I was kissing him, my
lover, and suddenly he was dead, burned. <br>
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna<br>
TORRES: But there's more going on than just a love affair. I'm having a
relationship with this man, but my father doesn't approve, so we have
to sneak around. It's like each new dream advances the story. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It sounds like a holonovel. <br>
TORRES: It feels like it's actually happening! Physically, emotionally,
it's no different from real life. I've never had dreams like this
before. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It can't be a coincidence that this is going on while we have
a group of telepaths on board. <br>
TORRES: Exactly. I want to find out more about what these Enarans can
do. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Why don't you ask your friend in Engineering. <br>
TORRES: I'm going to. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'll talk to the Captain. She should know anything that might
involve our guests. <br>
TORRES: Right. <br>

is at a podium, addressing a crowd of young people, including Korenna.)
<br>
JARETH: Once I stood where you are during the early days of
interstellar exploration. It was an important leap forward for our
people and I was proud to be part of it. Today, with the advent of
terraforming, we stand ready to take another leap forward into an era
of expansion and colonisation. You will show us the way. There are some
who resist progress. Do not let the voices of fear and ignorance
discourage you. Claim your rightful place as leaders of a new era. The
future of Enara is in your hands. (applause) Now today we honour a
group of young people who represent our best hope for that future. It
is a great pleasure to give this first award to my own daughter,
Korenna. <br>
(She steps forward to have the medallion placed around her neck.) <br>
JARETH: I'm so very proud of you. <br>
(She meets Dathan in a shady colonnade at the side of the square.) <br>
DATHAN: It looks good on you. <br>
TORRES: What are you doing here? <br>
DATHAN: Today's important for you and I wanted to be here. <br>
TORRES: I'm glad you came. I know this award will help me get into the
District Education Centre. I could be a junior instructor in less than
a year. <br>
DATHAN: I'm really happy for you. <br>
TORRES: Maybe you could take the entrance examination too. <br>
DATHAN: It's impossible. I can't go to the Centre. <br>
TORRES: Nothing is impossible if you want it badly enough. I want us to
be together. <br>
DATHAN: I love you, Korenna. It's just so frustrating. I can't stand
being away from you all the time. <br>
TORRES: Oh, I know. <br>
DATHAN: Oh, I wish I could hold you right now.<br>
TORRES: What would you do if you could? <br>
DATHAN: I'll show you. <br>

DATHAN: I'll see you tonight. <br>
TORRES: No, no. There's going to be a big dinner with my father's
friends. <br>
DATHAN: Tomorrow night then. <br>
TORRES: Tomorrow. <br>
(Dathan leaves her to join a line of Enarans walking past guards, and
having their IDs scanned. The bell must be a curfew for the lower
orders.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (The
EMH shines a light in Torres' eye, and she sits up.) <br>
EMH: Good to see you're awake, Lieutenant. <br>
TORRES: What happened? <br>
KES: I found you unconscious in the corridor near Engineering. <br>
TORRES: I was dreaming again. <br>
EMH: Not according to your cortical theta wave readings. The pattern
clearly indicated that you were experiencing memories. Specifically,
implanted memories. <br>
TORRES: Implanted? By the Enarans? <br>
EMH: There's strong evidence of telepathic activity in your frontal
lobe. <br>
JANEWAY: My experience with the Enaran's telepathy seems to be very
different from yours. Jor Brel was standing near me when I received his
memories. Where there any Enarans near you when you had your dreams? <br>
TORRES: No, I was alone every time. <br>
JANEWAY: You've also been asleep or unconscious every time. The shared
memories feel like vivid dreams to you. <br>
EMH: In the Lieutenant's case, the memories seem to have been placed in
her unconscious. They're only emerging when her conscious mind is
inactive. <br>
KES: Why did she pass out? <br>
EMH: The synaptic patterns of the implanted memories are not quite
compatible with her neural pathways. There's been some minor cortical
damage which I've corrected. <br>
JANEWAY: Can you prevent further damage? <br>
EMH: This inhibitor will control her theta wave activity. That should
suppress the memories. <br>
TORRES: I won't have any more of the dreams? <br>
EMH: That's the idea. <br>
(Torres recoils from the inhibitor.) <br>
KES: What's wrong? <br>
TORRES: If the dreams stop, I'll never know what happens to these
people. This woman, Korenna, I feel what she feels, and right now she
is torn and confused about her loyalties and I don't know what I'm,
she's going to do. <br>
EMH: I don't think satisfying your curiosity is worth risking brain
damage, Lieutenant. <br>
(The EMH fits the inhibitor behind Torres' left ear.) <br>
JANEWAY: I'm giving you the next two days off duty. Use them to rest.
I'll speak with Brel and find out what's happening to you. <br>
TORRES: I'd like to come with you, Captain. I'd rest a lot better if I
had some answers. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Ready
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> BREL: I
find it impossible that any of us could be doing this purposely. <br>
TUVOK: You do possess the ability to share your experiences without
mutual consent. <br>
BREL: Yes, but it just isn't done. I know that we had a
misunderstanding before, Captain, but I assure you we have strict
ethics. <br>
JANEWAY: We're not suggesting otherwise. We're only trying to find out
how this is happening. <br>
BREL: Well, I have heard of instances where members of some alien races
have been affected by the slight telepathic field we generate, but
nothing as intense as what your Lieutenant has described. <br>
JANEWAY: And according to our doctor, they're memories. <br>
BREL: That's possible. She may be picking up stray thoughts and
memories from every Enaran on the ship. Must be terribly confusing.
Perhaps that's why her mind has organised it into a kind of narrative. <br>
TORRES: Are you saying that I'm making this all up? <br>
BREL: No, no, no. Some elements may very well have come from our actual
experiences. I confess I may have crawled into a bedroom window or two
in my youth. You mentioned a citizenship award. There are several past
recipients in our group. We may be each contributing some small details
to your story. <br>
TORRES: Nothing really happened the way I remember it? <br>
BREL: It's highly unlikely. <br>
JANEWAY: We appreciate your help, Jor Brel. <br>
BREL: I wish there was something more that I could do. I truly regret
any ill effects that our presence here has caused you. <br>
JANEWAY: Well fortunately those effects are under control now. The
doctor was able to suppress the memories. <br>
BREL: I'm very glad to hear that. <br>
(Jor Brel leaves.) <br>
TUVOK: His explanation is plausible. <br>
JANEWAY: B'Elanna. <br>
TORRES: I don't know. Those dreams are so real. Maybe he's right. <br>
JANEWAY: The Enarans haven't shown any hint of subterfuge, any hidden
agenda. They've been nothing but straight forward and honest. You're in
no immediate danger, and they'll be gone in another day. The situation
will resolve itself. <br>
TUVOK: And yet you fully intend to continue investigating. <br>
JANEWAY: I wonder how long it's been since I did anything that
surprised you? <br>
TUVOK: I share your concern, Captain. We haven't ruled out the
possibility that this may be a deliberate act. <br>
JANEWAY: I want to talk to more of the Enarans, see what they have to
say. <br>
TORRES: I'll talk to Jessen and Mirell. They've been working with me in
Engineering. <br>
JANEWAY: You've done enough already, B'Elanna. I want you to get some
rest. <br>
TORRES: But <br>
JANEWAY: You need to get away from this. We'll take it from here. </font></p>

<br>
TORRES: This is all voluntary, isn't it? They want to be resettled. <br>
JARETH: Of course. Although it's impossible to understand what these
Regressives want. They simply don't think like we do. How do we relate
to people who refuse all but the most primitive technology? Who live
their lives without a communications interlink or microfusion
generators? <br>
TORRES: If that's the way they want to live, why can't they? <br>
JARETH: Well, they can. That's why we're helping them to resettle. So
that they can be completely comfortable practicing a way of life that
they've chosen. <br>
TORRES: They could do that here, in their village. <br>
JARETH: Well, you wouldn't say that if you'd ever been inside that
place. Do you realise they won't even use radioseptics to sterilise
their homes or their hands before they eat? It's a miracle they haven't
started a plague by now. <br>
TORRES: Then it's dangerous to have them living here. <br>
JARETH: Yes, it is, and we've been tolerant for a very long time, but I
think by now even they realise that they'd be better off living
somewhere else. <br>
TORRES: But some of them want to stay here. <br>

they know it's best for them, and once they see their friends and

Korenna. Don't be a part of it any more. <br>
TORRES: It's just a resettlement. <br>
DATHAN: It's more than that. My uncle and his family were resettled two
months ago and we haven't heard from them since. Nobody I know has had
any contact with this new colony we're supposed to be going to. <br>
TORRES: There could be a perfectly good reason for that. <br>
DATHAN: There are stories. I've heard that the transports don't really
go anywhere, that the passengers just get vaporised in some kind of
thermal sweep. Korenna, thousands of us have gone already. We're being
slaughtered. <br>
TORRES: It's ridiculous! No one is being killed. My father told me
about <br>
DATHAN: Your father is lying to you. I'm sorry, but you have got to
make a choice. You can't go on trying to believe in both of us anymore.
Either he is right and you should never see me again, or I'm right and
he is part of a terrible crime. <br>
TORRES: No, my father is a good man. <br>
DATHAN: I can show you how we're rounded up for these voluntary
resettlements, how the soldiers treat Regressives who won't go quietly.
I know it is hard to face, but you have to. It is too important. Now,
let me show you. <br>
TORRES: No, I <br>
JARETH [OC]: Korenna! <br>
(She hides Dathan in the bathroom.) <br>
TORRES: Come in. I was just practising. <br>
JARETH: I've always said you have the talent to play professionally.
How are you feeling? <br>
TORRES: I've been better. <br>
JARETH: Well, don't think about it any more. That Regressive was
completely irrational. He attacked you for no reason. <br>
TORRES: Maybe he thought he had a reason. Maybe he was afraid. <br>
JARETH: I know there are some very disturbing rumours coming from these
people. You may have heard them from that boy. You know, the thing that
is so insidious about these Regressives is that they pretend to be
passive, not harming anyone, and all the while they're spreading their
lies, trying to make you believe these awful things. <br>
TORRES: Why would they do that? <br>
JARETH: They have some twisted ideas about resisting progress, which
they think gives them the right to hold us back in any way that they
can. They're trying to undermine us, to cause dissent and doubt. Just
look at how they've affected you. <br>
TORRES: But, what they're saying is so horrible. <br>
JARETH: Yes, but it isn't very plausible. Korenna, think. A secret
conspiracy against their people? Organised murder on such an enormous
scale? Do you really believe that your family and friends are capable
of that? <br>
TORRES: No. <br>
JARETH: Of course not. Now I know how hard it is for you to accept that
anyone, even Regressives, could lie about something like that, but it
is all part of their manipulation. These people have no conscience.
They'll say anything to get what they want. Like that boy Dathan. Has
he told you he's in love with you? He's not. It's his way of gaining
your sympathy. And not only yours. I've seen him talking to quite a
number of young women. Has he been asking you to trust him? He's
poisoning you against your own people, even your own family. That's
very cruel. No wonder you've been confused. But now you understand what
these people are really like. <br>
(In tears, Korenna looks towards her bathroom. Jareth follows her gaze,
gets up and pulls the curtains aside.) <br>
JARETH: You! <br>
DATHAN [OC]: No! No! No! <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Dathan
and the man who hit Korenna are fastened to posts.) <br>
JARETH: These criminals represent a growing threat to Enaran society.
As responsible citizens we must fight back. With their punishment we
send a clear signal to all Regressives. We will protect ourselves and
our ideals from their destructive influence by whatever means
necessary. <br>
(At a signal from Jareth, the posts that the men are fastened to glow
purple. The crowd bay for their blood as they slump forward, burned.
Korenna finally joins in.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> CHILD:
Why did they all move away? <br>
TORRES: Because they didn't want to live with the rest of us anymore. <br>
CHILD: Why? <br>
TORRES: The Regressive people had very strange ideas about how to live.
They didn't want to learn new things or use any of the new technology
that we tried to share with them. They decided to live somewhere else
on their own and we let them go. But they couldn't take very good care
of themselves. They fought with each other, they spread all kinds of
diseases. <br>
CHILD: And they all died? <br>
TORRES: They destroyed themselves. It was very sad. But we can learn
from their mistakes. That's why we keep this gate here, to remind us
never to be stubborn and backward like they were. <br>
CHILD: We'll remember. <br>
TORRES: I know you will. <br>

BREL: I'd like to indulge in a new custom I've learnt. It's called
making a toast. Captain Janeway and her gracious crew. We are very
grateful to you for bringing us home. You will always have friends
here. <br>
(Torres enters.) <br>
TORRES: Murderers! <br>
JANEWAY: Lieutenant. <br>
TORRES: You tried to hide what you did, but I know. I saw everything.
The Regressives, the executions, wiping out an entire population and
then blaming them for it. <br>
BREL: This is most uncomfortable, Captain. Perhaps a more private
discussion would be <br>
TORRES: No, that's what you've been doing all along. Hiding the truth.
Hoping it would just die away quietly. Please, this has to come out. <br>
JANEWAY: I think it's time we all understood what's been happening
here. <br>
TORRES: My dreams. They are real memories from Jora Mirell. When she,
when all of them were younger, there was a group of people they called
Regressives. They just wanted to lead a different kind of life. But,
but they don't exist anymore, do they? You exterminated them. <br>
BREL: These accusations are completely untrue. <br>
TORRES: You've spent you whole life covering it up, but then you
realised that someone was passing the memories on to me, so you, you
used me to figure out who it was and then you killed her. But you know,
you were too late. Because Korenna gave me the last of her memories
before she died. <br>
BREL: Korenna Mirell is dead? <br>
CHAKOTAY: And you have evidence that she was murdered? <br>
TORRES: No. They made it look like it was natural causes. <br>
TUVOK: You should know, Lieutenant, that I spoke with Jora Mirell
yesterday. I asked her specifically about the memories you had
experienced. She claimed not to know anything about them. <br>
TORRES: Of course she would say that. She was afraid for her life. <br>
JESSEN: No, you lying. The Enarans would never do anything like what
you're saying. It's unthinkable. <br>
TORRES: It is the truth. I know that you don't want to believe it. In
fact, they're counting on that. They always have. <br>
KIM: I know B'Elanna and I trust her. It can't hurt to listen. <br>
BREL: Nobody thinks you're lying, Lieutenant. The poor woman has been
ill for a long time. Her memories may be distorted or perhaps your
perception of them was coloured by elements from your culture. <br>
TORRES: No. I know that it's easier for you to believe that I'm crazy
or hallucinating, but this woman shared her life, her whole identity
with me. I was with her every step of the way as she convinced herself
that what she did, betraying the man she loved, playing her part in a
massacre, that it was all somehow for the good of Enaran society. She
showed me everything. No apologies, no request for forgiveness, just
the truth. At least she had the conscience to stand up and realise what
she'd done wrong, which is more than I can say for you. <br>
BREL: I think it best that we now prepare for our departure, Captain.
If you don't mind, I'd like to go to your sickbay to attend Jora
Mirell. <br>
(Jor Brel leaves. Janeway speaks to Torres.) <br>
JANEWAY: I'm going to talk to the Doctor. I want to see you in my Ready
room in one hour. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Ready
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
I know that I could have found a better way to handle the situation
than just charging into the mess hall like that. I was just too angry
to think straight. Not the first time that's happened, I know, but if
you had seen what I saw <br>
JANEWAY: I might have done exactly the same thing. <br>
TORRES: You believe me. <br>
JANEWAY: I believe that the memories you experienced were real. <br>
TORRES: Then we've got to do something about it. We have to make this
public. <br>
JANEWAY: You tried that today, They didn't want to listen. <br>
TORRES: Then we have to find proof. Let me go down to the planet. There
must be some evidence left of what really happened. Maybe there are
other people like Korenna who might be willing to tell the truth. <br>
JANEWAY: Whatever the Enarans have done, it's not our place to bring
them to justice. If they've chosen to conceal part of their history
from their own descendants, that's their decision, whether we approve
of it or not. <br>
TORRES: It's not just a matter of history. This could happen again if
no one knows it happened before. <br>
JANEWAY: We simply have no right to get involved. <br>
TORRES: Jora Mirell was murdered on board this ship, which gives us a
reason to investigate. Maybe, if we can expose the reason why she was
killed, the Enarans will start to ask questions. <br>
JANEWAY: I've gotten a full report from the Doctor. He specifically
looked for evidence to support your accusations. He didn't find any. <br>
TORRES: They could have used their telepathy somehow, in some way that
the Doctor couldn't detect. <br>
JANEWAY: We have no basis for a murder investigation. I've released her
body to the Enarans. <br>
TORRES: So that's it? We just go on our merry way and nobody ever has
to take any kind of responsibility? <br>
JANEWAY: I've cancelled our trade negotiations as well as shore leave.
We'll leave orbit as soon as the Enarans are off the ship. B'Elanna, I
believe the Enaran engineers are collecting the last of their equipment
right now. If there's anything more you'd like to say to any of them? <br>
TORRES: Thank you. Thank you, Captain. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (A
guard is watching the Enarans.) <br>
TORRES: I'm relieving you. Can we talk for a minute? <br>
JESSEN: I have nothing to say to you. <br>
TORRES: Then just listen. Like Harry said, it couldn't hurt to do that.
<br>
JESSEN: I'm leaving soon. <br>
TORRES: I know you have no reason to believe what I've said about your
people. All you have is my word against everything you've ever been
taught. <br>
JESSEN: That's right. <br>
TORRES: So prove me wrong. Go down to Enara and find the colony where
the Regressives were supposed to live. Talk to people. Ask questions.
Learn the truth for yourself. Let me tell you about my experiences,
maybe that will give you some place to start. I wish I had your
abilities. I could just show you. <br>
JESSEN: You would do that? Share your experiences openly? <br>
TORRES: Of course. Then you'd know I'm telling you the truth. <br>
JESSEN: I can make the connection between us. <br>
