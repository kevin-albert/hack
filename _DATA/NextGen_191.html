an uncharted binary star system, where we may have located the USS

around them. Others were found in the corridors where they'd obviously
had hand to hand combat. It's going to take some time to analyse and

appalling. There was no outside source, no alien presence. All thirty
four of them appear to have killed each other. <br>
PICARD: What could have caused such an event? Drugs? A virus? Poison? <br>
CRUSHER: Toxicological tests showed no unusual substances in their
systems, and they all appear to be in good health. But for whatever
reason, they seemed to turn against each other, using phasers and
knives and bare hands. I'd like you to see this, Captain. It's from the
logs of the Brittain. Captain Zaheva's mental condition deteriorated
steadily once they'd became stranded. She began talking of plots and
mutinies. This was the last entry log, made after they had been adrift
for over three weeks. <br>

They got to the engines. They don't work anymore. Had to eliminate

Brittain and the Enterprise, as well as the data from the last series
of probes, I conclude that we have become trapped in a massive rupture
in space, into which energy is absorbed. <br>
PICARD: You mean a Tyken's rift. <br>
CRUSHER: A what? <br>
DATA: A rare anomaly named after Bela Tyken, the Melthusian captain who
first encountered it. <br>
LAFORGE: Tyken's rift. That would explain why we don't have engine
power. <br>
DATA: The ship's energy is being drained into the fissure before we can
utilise it. <br>
(Worf enters) <br>
WORF: I was detained. <br>
DATA: When Tyken was trapped in the rift, his analysis determined that
a massive energy release might overload and dislocate the anomaly.
Fortunately, his cargo included anicium and yurium, which he used to
detonate the explosion. He then escaped through the ruptured centre of
the rift. <br>
LAFORGE: But we aren't carrying anything that could produce that kind
of explosion. Not even our photon torpedoes would be enough. <br>
RIKER: Couldn't we replicate the elements that Tyken used? <br>
DATA: No, sir. We no longer have the power to reproduce complex
elements in the replicator. We must find a way to generate a violent
energy release without using conventional means. <br>
CRUSHER: Data, in Tyken's experience did the crew exhibit behavioural
changes? <br>
DATA: No. There were no reports of unusual conduct among the crew. <br>

the. <br>

CRUSHER: Right. And I've also done some scans on a random cross-section
from our crew. They both have the same results, a unique chemical
imbalance. <br>
PICARD: Caused by? <br>
CRUSHER: Dream deprivation. Every night when we enter into sleep. <br>
DATA: I believe the Doctor means is that humans enter what is known as
REM sleep. Rapid eye movement. It is the level of
brain wave activity at which one dreams. <br>
CRUSHER: We have to dream in order to survive. If we don't reach REM
sleep, we don't dream, we begin to lose our cognitive abilities, we
find it hard to concentrate. We forget how to do the most ordinary
task. Then we become irritable, paranoid. Some people experience
hallucinations. <br>

Troi reported nightmares. <br>

is an inevitable conclusion to this pattern, and if I can't find a way
to stop it, we will all go insane.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Acting Captain's log, stardate 44642.1. I have
assumed command of the Enterprise at the request of Captain Picard. Our
situation is deteriorating. Many of the crew are unable to function and
our life support systems are beginning to falter.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TROI [OC]: Once before you said double. What did
you mean? What is double? <br>
HAGAN [OC]: Mates, too bright. Twin. Cannot leave the twin. One moon
circling. <br>
TROI [OC]: What do you mean? you can't leave? <br>
HAGAN [OC]: No, no, please. Can't. <br>
TROI [OC]: You want to leave. Why can't you? <br>
HAGAN [OC]: Can't go. Help. One moon circling. Eyes, that's it. Eyes in
the dark. <br>
TROI: Eyes in the dark. That's what the voice said in my dream. Is that
where you heard it? In a dream? Over and over? Beverly, I know what it
is. I know what's happening. <br>
CRUSHER: What? <br>
TROI: My nightmare. It's not a dream. It's not a dream at all. It's a
message. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ready room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TROI: REM sleep occurs at a different frequency for
Betazoids than other humanoids. I believe the beings are using that
frequency to communicate telepathically. <br>
DATA: It is possible that this telepathic communication is creating
interference in the REM sleep of other species. That would explain why
the rest of our crew is not dreaming. <br>
PICARD: Counsellor, what are these beings trying to tell us? <br>
TROI: They're calling for help. I think they're trapped just like we
are. Eyes in the dark could mean this twin star system. <br>
DATA: Your hypothesis is certainly plausible. There may be another ship
on the other side of the fissure, where we cannot detect it. <br>
CRUSHER: Is there a way we could block their signals? <br>
DATA: There is no technology to block telepathic transmissions, Doctor.
<br>
TROI: Maybe communication through dreams can work both ways. I could
try to get them to stop. <br>
DATA: Perhaps we can accomplish more than that. If there is another
ship, and we can reach them, we might be able to coordinate our efforts
to free ourselves. <br>
TROI: It is conceivable. When working with patients with debilitating
nightmares, I've often used a
therapeutic treatment called directed dreaming. Dreamers can learn to
control of their dreams, retain a conscious memory even while in REM
sleep. I could remember a short message and deliver it to them. <br>
PICARD: If it were possible, what would you say?

DATA: Working together with the aliens, we must discover a means by
which we an produce an explosion more intense than either one of us
could achieve alone. <br>
TROI: What is it you're looking for? <br>
DATA: These are the elements we have available. Some of them could be
used in the creation of an explosive reaction. If we could communicate
this inventory to the other ship, perhaps they would be able to <br>
TROI: No, Data, no. This is too complex. This has to be a simple, clear
message. <br>
DATA: I am uncertain if a simple transmission will be adequate. <br>
TROI: Stop. Go back. Further back. There. Stop. One moon circles. <br>
DATA: Yes, Counsellor. One electron circles one proton. This is a
hydrogen atom. <br>
TROI: One moon circles. That's what they've been telling me over and
over. <br>
DATA: Perhaps the aliens are thinking as we are, to collaborate in
producing an explosion. If hydrogen is combined with another element,
calendenium for example, it is extremely volatile. But would the
message mean they have hydrogen or they want hydrogen? <br>
TROI: Well, if it's a distress call, I think they'd be asking for what
they need, not what they already have. <br>
DATA: Then the proper course of action would be to release hydrogen
into the rift, and hope that they have a substance that will detonate
it. <br>
TROI: How do I tell them what to do? <br>
DATA: If you are correct, Counsellor, I believe they have already told
us what to do and are waiting for us to do it. When we are ready, the
only message you should attempt to convey is, now.
