</i>EMH: Questa o quella per me pari sono a quant'altre d'intorno mi vedo, del mio core
l'impero non cedo meglio ad una che ad altre belta. La costoro
avvenenza e qual dono di che ilfato ne infiora la vita. S'oggi questa
mi torna gradita, forse un'altra, forse un'altra. <br>(During this vigorous recital, Janeway enters from the aft compartment with a face like thunder. He feels the vibes and stops.)<br>EMH: Captain. Computer,
pause music. I didn't wake you, did I? <br>
JANEWAY: That's all right, Doctor. Fifteen minutes of sleep is really
all I need. Coffee, black. Maybe you should pay a little more attention
to flying and a little less to singing. <br>
EMH: As a hologram, I can handle a variety of tasks at once. In
addition to piloting the Flyer, I'm writing a paper on the
physiological stresses of long duration space flight, and taking
holo-images of this
Mutara class nebula. <br>
JANEWAY: With a hologram on board, who needs a crew? <br>
EMH: I'd never admit this to anyone else, but there was a time when I
would have given anything to be flesh and blood. But I've come to
realise that being a hologram is far superior. <br>
JANEWAY: Really? <br>
EMH: No offence. I'll always enjoy the company of organics. In fact,
I'm delighted you were able to attend this medical symposium with me.
It's been a pleasure spending time with you. Actually, I was hoping we
might do this sort of thing more often. <br>(Shudder, beep.)<br>EMH: Hmm. We're passing through a
subspace eddy. <br>
JANEWAY: It could be the wake of another ship. <br>
EMH: No, there's nothing on sensors. It's probably just the gravimetric
shear from the nebula. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe I should take the controls. <br>
EMH: Sit down and relax, Captain. You've got a hologram at the helm. </font></p>

PARIS [OC]: Paris to Torres. <br>
TORRES: Go ahead. <br>
PARIS [OC]: Can you pull yourself away from engineering for a few
minutes? I've got a shuttle down here with faulty deflector array. <br>

TORRES: Oh, you replicated potato salad. <br>
PARIS: With extra paprika, just the way you like it. <br>
TORRES: This is so sweet. But I can't. <br>
PARIS: Sure you can. I've already cleared it with Chakotay. <br>
TORRES: I told the captain I'd have the dilithium matrix recalibrated
before she got back. <br>
PARIS: You know, this might be our last chance to be alone for the next
eighteen years. <br>(In between kisses.)<br>

Report. <br>
AYALA: There's some kind of pulse being directed at our transceiver
array. It's coming from the Delta Flyer. <br>
KIM: Hail them. <br>
AYALA: No response. <br>
KIM: Looks like they've encoded the pulse with a comm. signal. <br>(He puts the signal on the viewscreen.)<br>KIM: Captain.<br>
JANEWAY [on viewscreen]: Sorry about the image, Ensign. Our comm.
system's been damaged. The only way I could send you a signal was
through the main deflector. <br>
KIM: Are you and the Doctor all right? <br>
JANEWAY [on viewscreen]: We're fine. Tell Commander Chakotay to meet me
in my ready room as soon as we've docked. Janeway out. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Ready
room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CHAKOTAY:
Harry tells me the Flyer took some damage.<br>
JANEWAY: That's an understatement. We almost didn't make it back in one
piece. They're called the R'Kaal. Their technology is decades ahead of
ours. Transphasic warp drive, multi-spectral cloaking systems. They
could destroy this ship before our sensors knew they were there. <br>
CHAKOTAY: They sound like people we should avoid. <br>
JANEWAY: I wish that were possible. They control thousands of parsecs
from here to the edge of the Beta Quadrant. They're ecological
extremists. They believe conventional warp engines damage subspace, so
they've outlawed warp travel through their territory. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Then we should reverse course and find a way around. <br>
JANEWAY: That's the problem. We've already been in their space for
three weeks without knowing it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You'd think they'd mark their borders a little more clearly.<br>
JANEWAY: As punishment, their law demands that our ship be dismantled. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Obviously we're not going to let that happen.<br>
JANEWAY: I spent three hours explaining our situation to their Supreme
Archon, a thoroughly unpleasant man. I convinced him to spare Voyager,
but at a price. We're going to rendezvous with their armada and
surrender our warp core at a class M planet where they've agreed to let
us settle. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Settle? <br>
JANEWAY: I didn't make this decision lightly, Chakotay. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We have to bring the senior staff in on this. We can find a
way to evade their ships, or adapt our sensors to their cloaking
technology. <br>
JANEWAY: We could try that, and we might make it past their armada, but
we could lose a lot of people in the process. Maybe the entire ship. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Kathryn, there's got to be another way. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm tired, Chakotay. Tired of casualty reports, of continually
risking my people on the slim chance that we'll make it home in one
piece. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We've found our way out of worse situations. <br>
JANEWAY: Set a course.<br>
CHAKOTAY: What am I supposed to tell the crew? <br>
JANEWAY: For now, I'd like to keep this between us. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's not like you to keep your people in the dark<br>
JANEWAY: I'll make an announcement when the time is right. Dismissed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TORRES:
Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry to interrupt, but I could use your input on a
hypothetical scenario. <br>
TORRES: Of course. <br>
JANEWAY: If we were to eject the core, could it be towed safely at warp?<br>
TORRES: In theory. But a tractor beam might destabilise the containment
field. You'd be risking a breach. <br>
JANEWAY: Could you compensate for that? <br>
TORRES: You could configure the tractor emitters to generate a
resonance pulse. That should stabilise the field. <br>
JANEWAY: Can you make those modifications to the Delta Flyer's tractor
emitters? <br>
TORRES: I suppose. <br>
JANEWAY: How long would it take? <br>
TORRES: Er, a few hours. <br>
JANEWAY: Get started. <br>
TORRES: I thought this was a hypothetical scenario. <br>
JANEWAY: We should be prepared, just in case.<br>
TORRES: In case of what? <br>
JANEWAY: Let me know as soon as you're finished. <br>(Janeway leaves.)<br>
TORRES: Torres to Chakotay. <br>

B'Elanna tells me you ordered some modifications to the Flyer.<br>
JANEWAY: That's right. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe I misunderstood. I thought the plan was to hand over
the core when we reached the planet. Are we taking it somewhere else? <br>(Janeway looks down to her right and whispers.)<br>
JANEWAY: I heard you the first time. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: You've already made your concerns clear, Commander, but
there's been a slight change of plans. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Were you going to tell me? Kathryn, what's going on? <br>
JANEWAY: I don't feel well. I've got a headache. I'm going to my
quarters and I'd prefer not to be disturbed. You have the bridge. <br>(As she passes Tuvok.)<br>JANEWAY: Not

CHAKOTAY: Report to Sickbay immediately. <br>
(The EMH beams in.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Something wrong with the turbolifts? <br>
EMH: You did say immediately. How can I help you? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm concerned about the Captain. She doesn't seem to be
feeling well. <br>
EMH: What's wrong? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm not sure. She went to her quarters with a headache. <br>
EMH: I'll bring her an analgesic.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I was wondering if this could be related to your encounter
with the aliens. <br>
EMH: You think they harmed her?<br>
CHAKOTAY: You tell me. What did they do to her? <br>
EMH: I'm not sure, exactly. The aliens took my programme offline as
soon as they boarded the Flyer. The captain reactivated me a few hours
later and told me she'd been interrogated. Naturally, I examined her to
make sure she was all right. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Did you find anything unusual? <br>
EMH: I suppose I'm violating doctor-patient confidentiality by telling
you this but, she was fine. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'd like you to give her a more thorough examination. <br>
EMH: Gladly. But you know how she feels about physicals. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You can be very persuasive, Doctor. Contact me as soon as
you're done. <br>

Golorian trading vessel bearing one five six mark four. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If there were a fleet of cloaked ships in the vicinity, could
you devise a way to detect them? <br>
SEVEN: A cloaked fleet would generate significant subspace distortions.
Why do you ask? <br>
KIM [OC]: Commander, we're receiving a transmission. <br>

the core until we get there. <br>
LOTH [on screen]: If we don't receive the core within ten hours, my

Really, Chakotay. Sending the Doctor to check up on me. <br>

JANEWAY: Then why didn't you come to me directly? I thought we trusted
each other. <br>
CHAKOTAY: So did I. Something happened on that away mission that you're
not telling me. <br>
JANEWAY: I've told you everything you need to know. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You've consulted me on every major decision over the last
seven years, except this one. Why? <br>
JANEWAY: There are some decisions a captain has to make on her own. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I understand that, but every instinct tells me what you're
doing is wrong. Don't you remember what happened on Lesik Prime? <br>
JANEWAY: I don't see how that's relevant. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I think you do. Fifteen years ago, you were the lieutenant
who was kept in the dark. If you hadn't questioned your captain's
orders, the entire away team would have been lost. <br>
JANEWAY: This situation's entirely different. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You never told me that story. I made it up. Chakotay to Tuvok.<br>
