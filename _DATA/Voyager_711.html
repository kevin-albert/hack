<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Starship Voyager. We're
responding to your distress call. <br>
YEDIQ [OC]: A ruptured conduit is flooding my ship with plasma
radiation. We request immediate transport. <br>
KIM: I'm detecting eleven life signs. Two are weak. <br>
JANEWAY: Transport the injured to Sickbay and the rest to Cargo Bay
one. I want security teams at both locations.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Cargo
Bay one]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Nine people are beamed in, three in
dark overalls, six in light overalls. Tuvok and his team enters. The
leader of the dark overalls discovers his hands are empty.)<br>YEDIQ:
Our weapons! <br>
TUVOK: They'll be returned to you when you leave. <br>
YEDIQ: These are dangerous criminals. They have to be secured. <br>
TUVOK: We'll do our best to accommodate you. <br>
YEDIQ: I had eight men in custody. Where are the other two?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH:
We're not going to hurt you. <br>(One of them has a laser scalpel to Seven's throat.)<br>
IKO:&nbsp;Stay away or I'll kill her! <br>
EMH: I'm sure we can resolve this without resorting to violence. What
is it you want? <br>
IKO: A ship, some food. <br>
EMH: I might be able to arrange that, but you'll have to release her
first. <br>
IKO: I'm not a fool. <br>(Tuvok and Yediq enter.) <br>IKO: You know I'll do it. Tell
them. <br>
YEDIQ: You're not getting off this ship. <br>
TUVOK: If you release her, I promise you won't be harmed. <br>
IKO: Not until I get a ship. <br>
YEDIQ: We don't negotiate with criminals. <br>
EMH: Who are you? <br>
YEDIQ: Warden Yediq of the Nygean Detention Force. This man is my
prisoner. <br>
EMH: If that were true, he wouldn't be holding my friend hostage.
<br>(Seven elbows Iko in the stomach and is free, so he grabs the EMH&nbsp;instead.) <br>
IKO: Get back! <br>
EMH: I'm a hologram. I can't be harmed. <br>(Tuvok fires his phaser through the EMH and stuns Iko.) <br>EMH: I think you proved my point.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Ready
room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">YEDIQ:
We're lucky you came along, Captain. Ten more minutes and none of use
would have survived the plasma leak. <br>
TUVOK: Your vessel was equipped with escape pods. Why didn't you use
them? <br>
YEDIQ: I couldn't risk letting any of the prisoners get away. As you've
seen, they're extremely dangerous. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Where are you taking them? <br>
YEDIQ: Back to our homeworld. They're due to be executed. <br>
TUVOK: What were their crimes? <br>
YEDIQ: All eight are murderers. Three are multiple offenders. We're
just thirteen light years from our system. I'd appreciate it if you'd
take us back there. <br>
JANEWAY: Actually, we were headed in the opposite direction. <br>
YEDIQ: I could arrange for one of our ships to rendezvous with Voyager.
It'll take several days. My prisoners will have to be strictly
monitored. <br>
JANEWAY: Commander Tuvok will help you make arrangements. <br>(Tuvok and
Yediq leave.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Some of the crew may not be comfortable helping to deliver
eight men to their deaths. <br>
JANEWAY: I can't say I like it either, but we have a Prime Directive to
follow. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH:
Thirty more seconds and I could have resolved the situation peacefully.
Instead, you and Tuvok the Kid had to take matters into your own hands.
<br>(The EMH flickers.) <br>
SEVEN: You're damaged. <br>
EMH: Commander Tuvok's friendly fire must have caused a feedback surge
in my emitters. <br>
SEVEN: I'll help you repair it. <br>(Janeway enters.)<br>
JANEWAY: How are you? <br>
SEVEN: Fine, Captain. <br>
IKO: You. This your ship? <br>
JANEWAY: Yes. <br>
IKO: Then let me out. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm afraid I can't do that. <br>(Iko
and the other injured prisoner are behind the surgical bay forcefield.
He proves it by pushing against it as long as he can.)<br>
IKO: If you don't, I'll kill you all. <br>
JANEWAY: Janeway to Tuvok. Are the prisoners' accommodations ready? <br>
TUVOK [OC]: Affirmative, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Then by all means, initiate transport. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Cargo
Bay one]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Iko and his companion are transported into mesh cages.)<br>YEDIQ:
You're sure these will hold them? <br>
TUVOK: The force fields are impenetrable, as are the tritanium
bulkheads. In addition to your staff, two Voyager security officers
will remain here at all times. Two more will be posted at the entrance
to the cargo bay. <br>
YEDIQ: What about our weapons? <br>
TUVOK: You'll be allowed to carry them in this area only. If you leave
the cargo bay, you'll be asked to surrender them. <br>
YEDIQ: What's this? <br>(Neelix is pushing a trolley.)<br>
NEELIX: Dinner. Since you can't bring the prisoners to the mess hall, I've
brought the mess hall to them. <br>
YEDIQ: What is it? <br>
NEELIX: Talaxian spice stew served over leola rice pilaf. It's an old
family recipe. <br>
YEDIQ: Take it back. <br>
NEELIX: Too spicy? <br>
YEDIQ: These men don't deserve such an elaborate meal. Take it back. <br>
NEELIX: Federation guidelines are quite clear about the treatment of
prisoners. <br>
TUVOK: He is correct. <br>
NEELIX: I can quote the protocols if you like. <br>(Yediq confiscates the forks.)<br>
YEDIQ: My men will assist you. <br>(Neelix serves some stew into a bowl. A hole is created in a forcefield for him to pass it through to the first prisoner.)<br>
JOLEG: Thanks for standing up to Yediq. <br>
NEELIX: Just doing my job. <br>
JOLEG: Still, it was kind. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
This would be easier if you would remain stationary. <br>
EMH: It doesn't feel right. <br>
SEVEN: You may experience unusual sensations while your matrix
realigns. <br>
EMH: I was referring to the arrangement the captain's made with the
Nygeans. No matter how terrible the crimes these men committed, it
seems wrong to hand them over to be executed. This is a Federation
Starship, not the Barge of the Dead. <br>
SEVEN: Would you have preferred the captain release them? <br>
EMH: Of course not. They're dangerous men. <br>
SEVEN: Executing them ensures they'll never pose a threat to anyone
again. <br>
EMH: So would life sentences, the operative word being life. <br>
SEVEN: Confining them for life requires significant resources. The
Nygeans may not think it worthwhile. <br>
EMH: What about rehabilitation? Given the chance, some of these men
might become productive members of society one day. <br>
SEVEN: Their victims won't have the same opportunity. <br>
EMH: And that justifies taking their lives? An eye for an eye? It's not
justice, it's revenge. Quite frankly, I'm surprised you're not troubled
by such a barbaric system. <br>
SEVEN: I'm simply being objective. You often encourage me to see both
sides of an argument. <br>
EMH: Well, this is one occasion when my programming won't allow me to
be objective. Killing is wrong, no matter who's doing it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Cargo
Bay one]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Iko throws his empty bowl across his cell.)<br>JOLEG:
Still hungry? I can hear your stomach from here. This must be the first
time in a month you couldn't steal poor Egrid's meal. <br>(He rattles his cage.) <br>JOLEG: Good, isn't it? <br>(Iko throws his bowl at the forcefield. Yediq and a guard come down the row.)<br>
YEDIQ: Is there a problem? <br>
JOLEG: Iko was just telling me he didn't get enough to eat. <br>
YEDIQ: I see. Cause another disturbance, and I'll see to it you're not
fed the rest of this journey. Do you understand? <br>
IKO: Boche and Ledara. <br>
YEDIQ: What did you say? <br>
IKO: Your children. <br>
YEDIQ: How did you know that? <br>
IKO: Are you sure they're safe? <br>
YEDIQ: Some people don't understand why we deal so harshly with men
like you. It's because you never learn. <br>
(Three Nygean guards enter Iko's cell and beat him up with their weapons. Two Starfleet guards come running.) <br>ANDREWS: Stand down. Stand down! <br>
YEDIQ: He needs to be disciplined. <br>ANDREWS: Lower your weapons and step away.<br>(Yediq nods and his men obey after a last kick. Iko lies bleeding and unconscious on the deck.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Ready
room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">YEDIQ:
Our response was justified. <br>
JANEWAY: How do you justify beating a defenceless man? <br>
YEDIQ: Violence is the only thing he understands. <br>
JANEWAY: You seem to have a pretty good grasp of it yourself. <br>
YEDIQ: Do not presume to tell me how to handle my prisoners, Captain.
You don't know Iko like I do. He killed a young father for no reason.
Before that, he committed dozens of violent crimes. He spent his entire
life hurting people. <br>
JANEWAY: That doesn't excuse what you did to him. Until your transport
vessel gets here, you and your men won't be allowed in the cargo bay.
You're in charge of the prisoners. <br>
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. <br>
YEDIQ: They're my responsibility. <br>
JANEWAY: Not as long as you're aboard my ship. I won't risk any more
violence. <br>
YEDIQ: The only risk will be to your crew. Commander Tuvok isn't
qualified to guard prisoners this dangerous. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok has been a Starfleet Security officer for a very long
time. Believe me, he's qualified. <br>
YEDIQ: I hope you're right. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Iko has been transported for treatment. Seven enters.)<br>EMH: You
remember Mister Iko. <br>
SEVEN: Vividly. <br>
EMH: The Nygeans decided to make an example of him. <br>
SEVEN: Did you call me here to make a point about Nygean barbarity? <br>
EMH: I called you here because I need your help to save his life. He
sustained a severe blow to the head which has caused severe oedema in
his parietal lobe. It's blocking vital neurotransmitters. I'd like to
programme some of your nanoprobes to bypass the oedema. <br>
SEVEN: I'll comply. <br>
EMH: I sense a but coming. <br>
SEVEN: It seems inefficient to save the life of someone who's about to
be executed. <br>
EMH: If the Nygeans insist on killing him, there isn't much I can do
about it. But I won't let them do it on Voyager. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Cargo
Bay one]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Neelix is serving the next meal.)<br>JOLEG: I
didn't expect to see you back so soon. Ordinarily, we're lucky to get
one meal a day. <br>
NEELIX: That's terrible. <br>
JOLEG: Yediq likes to keep us hungry. <br>
PRISONER [OC]: Less talk. We're hungry. <br>
JOLEG: You're wondering why I'm here. <br>
NEELIX: Excuse me? <br>
JOLEG: You're wondering what I did to end up with men like them. <br>
NEELIX: You killed someone. <br>
JOLEG: That's right. <br>(Neelix hands Joleg his meal.)<br>
NEELIX: Why? <br>
JOLEG: Because I'm Benkaran. <br>
NEELIX: What does that have to do with it? <br>
JOLEG: It's common knowledge that all Benkarans are criminals. So when
I was found in the vicinity of a murder, I was immediately arrested. <br>
NEELIX: Are you saying you didn't do it? <br>
JOLEG: I told you, I'm Benkaran. What I say doesn't matter. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The EMH wakes Iko.)<br>EMH: You
suffered severe neurological trauma, but I believe we've repaired the
damage. <br>
IKO: Thank you. <br>
EMH: Don't thank me, thank Seven of Nine. She donated the nanoprobes
that saved your life. <br>
IKO: Oh, my head. <br>
EMH: The pain is normal. I'll prepare an analgesic. <br>(The EMH walks through the forcefield.)<br>
IKO: You're not afraid of me. <br>
SEVEN: There's no reason to fear someone in your condition. <br>
IKO: You were never afraid of me. Not even when I tried to kill you.
It's nice to look into someone's eyes and not see fear.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS
[OC]: You have to be a criminal to get something to eat around here? <br>(Neelix is reading a PADD while tending a pot.)<br>
NEELIX: Sorry. Dinner will be ready in fifteen minutes. <br>(Torres slides the shutters apart.)<br>
TORRES:&nbsp;You said that fifteen minutes ago. <br>
NEELIX: Did you know the Nygeans govern a sector of space occupied by
several different humanoid species? <br>
PARIS: If we say yes, will you feed us? <br>
NEELIX: One of those species is the Benkarans. They occupy just ten
percent of Nygean space, but take up nearly eighty percent of the space
in Nygean prisons. <br>
PARIS: Maybe they commit more crimes. <br>
NEELIX: Not according to Joleg, one of the prisoners. <br>
TORRES: You think he was given a harsher sentence because of his
species? <br>
NEELIX: According to this, Benkarans are ten times more likely to be
executed for their crimes than Nygeans. <br>
TORRES: Where'd you get that? <br>
NEELIX: I contacted the Nygean government. Told them I was interested
in a cultural exchange. Among other things, they let me access data on
their criminal justice system. It all supports what Joleg told me. <br>
PARIS: Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: I know what you're thinking. <br>
PARIS: That you're the softest touch in the Delta Quadrant. <br>
NEELIX: These are the transcripts from Joleg's trial. He was convicted
on circumstantial evidence. <br>
PARIS: Let me guess. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time? <br>
NEELIX: Apparently. <br>
PARIS: Neelix, when I was in the Federation penal colony, everybody had
a story. I never put much stock in them. Neither should you. <br>
NEELIX: How many of those people were sentenced to die? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">IKO: I
still don't understand. Why weren't you hurt? <br>
EMH: Because my matrix is photonic. I'm made of light. <br>
SEVEN: You wanted to see me? <br>
EMH: I'll be with you in just a moment. <br>
IKO: You don't feel pain? <br>
EMH: Well, I suppose my pride has been wounded on occasion. <br>
IKO: I wish I was made of light. <br>
EMH: Try to rest. <br>(He walks through security forcefield.) <br>EMH: Mister Iko
responded so well to the first dose of nanoprobes, I thought a second
might improve his condition further. It'll only take a moment to
extract them. <br>
SEVEN: You and Mister Iko seem to be getting along well. <br>
EMH: It's the strangest thing. When he first arrived he was crude,
abusive. Now he's a model patient. Grateful, considerate. <br>
SEVEN: He's obviously an unstable individual. Inconsistent behaviour is
hardly surprising. <br>
EMH: Still, if it weren't for the security detail, I'd forget he was a
criminal. <br>
SEVEN: It's possible he's trying to manipulate you. <br>
IKO: Doctor? <br>
EMH: What's the matter? <br>
IKO: My stomach. <br>
EMH: I'm not detecting anything. <br>
IKO: I, I can't. <br>
EMH: What's wrong? <br>
IKO: I can't stop thinking about the man I killed. <br>
SEVEN: That's not surprising. You're experiencing guilt. <br>
IKO: Is that why I'm feeling sick? <br>
EMH: Nausea could be a symptom of guilt. <br>
IKO: I've never felt guilty before. <br>
SEVEN: You've committed many crimes. <br>
IKO: None of them made me feel like this. Why did you do this to me? <br>
SEVEN: We're not responsible for your guilt. <br>
IKO: I didn't feel this way until you put those nanoprobes in me. You
knew this would happen, didn't you? This is some kind of punishment.
Take the nanoprobes out. <br>
EMH: You could die. <br>
IKO: Please. I don't want to feel this way anymore.&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Medical lab]<br></b></font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN: You don't honestly believe we're responsible for his condition. <br>

SEVEN: Guilt, for example. <br>

SEVEN: What? <br>
EMH: It's my most recent scan. The neurotransmitters have established
new pathways throughout his cortex. <br>
SEVEN: Wasn't that your intention? <br>
EMH: No, I was simply trying to bypass the oedema. <br>
SEVEN: Then how did this happen? <br>
EMH: I don't know. It's possible this is normal Nygean brain activity,

official. Maybe they could provide some relevant information.&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]<br></b></font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2">IKO: Seven of Nine. Stay and talk to me. <br>

there's <br>
IKO: Astrometrics? What's that? <br>
SEVEN: A laboratory where we observe stellar phenomena. <br>
IKO: When I was a child, I'd lie under the stars for hours. I'd stare at
them until I could see the shapes. <br>
SEVEN: Shapes? <br>
IKO: Faces and animals made out of stars. <br>
SEVEN: You're referring to constellations. <br>
IKO: I named them. There was Paedos the warrior, and Gezid the beast.
No matter how hard he tried Paedos could never catch Gezid. <br>
SEVEN: Because the distance between them always remained the same. <br>
IKO: You've seen them? <br>
SEVEN: Possibly. I've catalogued approximately six billion stars. <br>
IKO: Then you must have seen Onella, too. The Mother. <br>

Eleven six, green. <br>
PRISONER [OC]: What's going on over there? <br>JOLEG: Kot-kot.<br>
NEELIX: That's Kadis-kot. Congratulations. <br>PRISONER [OC]: Down here.<br>NEELIX: I've been doing some
research on the Nygean legal system. You were right about the Benkarans
receiving harsher sentences. I saw the statistics. <br>
JOLEG: The statistics won't save me. <br>
NEELIX: I noticed some people convicted of murder, even terrible
premeditated murders, weren't executed. Some aren't punished at all. But you were sentenced to death. <br>
JOLEG: That's what the family wants. <br>
NEELIX: The family? <br>
JOLEG: After you're convicted, the family of the victim sentences you. <br>
NEELIX: Well, shouldn't you be sentenced by someone less partial, like
a judge? <br>
JOLEG: Vekto valek k'vadim. It's ancient Nygean. It means Favour The
Victims. What if I stole your game board? What right would a judge have
to assign value to your loss? To him, it's just a game board, but to
you it might be a priceless family possession. And what if I murdered
your child? <br>
NEELIX: I think I get your point. <br>
JOLEG: Vekto valek k'vadim. It's the basis for the Nygean legal system.
<br>
NEELIX: What about the criminals that didn't serve any sentence at all?
<br>
JOLEG: Some people prefer restitution to revenge. If a defendant is
wealthy enough, he can negotiate a settlement with the victim's family.
<br>
NEELIX: Oh, that doesn't seem fair. <br>
JOLEG: It's perfectly fair, unless you're destitute. <br>
NEELIX: Maybe I can talk to the captain about finding a way to
compensate your victims. <br>
JOLEG: I'm grateful. But it would imply I'm guilty. I wouldn't want
that. <br>
NEELIX: There must be something I can do. <br>
JOLEG: You can transmit a letter to my brother. I'd like to let him

IKO: I hurt people. I deserve to die. <br>(The EMH comes out of the medical lab.)<br>
EMH: Seven? I found something. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Medical lab]<br></b></font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Cerebral scan 1028)<br>EMH:
This is a scan depicting a healthy Nygean brain. This node is analogous
to the human pineal gland. In addition to controlling behavioural
impulses, it regulates decision making. You might say it's the
physiological equivalent of a conscience. <br>
SEVEN: Normally, the node connects to the rest of the brain through a
series of neural pathways. <br>
EMH: Now look at this scan of Iko's node before we applied the
nanoprobes. It's detached. <br>
JANEWAY: Did that happen when he was assaulted? <br>
EMH: No, I believe it's congenital. A birth defect. <br>
SEVEN: Without the node, Iko would have been prone to violence and
sociopathic behaviour all his life. <br>
EMH: When I used Seven's nanoprobes to treat the injuries from the
assault, it seems they inadvertently repaired the defect as well. <br>
JANEWAY: You've activated his conscience. Well, that would explain why
he's suddenly experiencing guilt. <br>
EMH: There's more to it than that. I believe he's become capable of
controlling his violent impulses. <br>
JANEWAY: Capable maybe, but how do you know he will? <br>
EMH: Even the thought of violence makes him ill now. In my opinion,
he's no longer a threat to anyone. <br>

committed the murder. </font></p>

Are you suggesting we release him? <br>
EMH: Of course not. But at the very least his case should be
re-examined. <br>
YEDIQ: Because he's sorry. <br>
SEVEN: There's new medical evidence to be considered. <br>
YEDIQ: None of it changes the fact that he killed a man. <br>
SEVEN: He was suffering from a neurological defect. He couldn't control
his behaviour. <br>
EMH: If Iko had been diagnosed and treated, he never would have
committed that crime. In a matter of speaking, he's a victim of his own
biology. <br>
YEDIQ: So Iko is the victim now? <br>
JANEWAY: No one's denying that he committed a terrible crime. But as a
result of the Doctor's treatments he's undergone a fundamental change.
Killing him won't accomplish anything. <br>

SEVEN: Nor is it yours. <br>
YEDIQ: He's obviously deceiving you somehow. <br>
JANEWAY: Listen, we could debate this all day but the fact is, our
personal opinions are irrelevant. All that matters is Nygean law. <br>
TUVOK: Does Iko have a legal means of appeal at his disposal? <br>
YEDIQ: In accordance with Nygean penal code, a capital defendant has a
right to appeal his sentence to the family of his victims. <br>
JANEWAY: Then I'd like you to help Commander Tuvok draft an appeal and
submit it to the proper authorities. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">IKO:
Take back the appeal. <br>
SEVEN: You'd rather die because you think it'll relieve your pain. <br>
IKO: Death is what I deserve. You say I've changed, but I look at these
hands every day and I see them squeezing that man's throat. And I hear
the sounds he made. I'm disgusting. <br>
SEVEN: Do you think I'm disgusting? <br>
IKO: You've been nothing but kind to me. <br>
SEVEN: You asked me earlier if it hurt when my occipital implant was
installed. I told you I didn't remember. But the truth is, it was one of
the most painful experiences of my life. <br>
IKO: Why did you lie? <br>
SEVEN: It's difficult for me to talk about, because I forced others to
undergo the same procedure. <br>
IKO: Why? <br>
SEVEN: I was compelled to do so by the Borg Collective. I wasn't in
control of my actions, just as you weren't in control when you took a
life. My nanoprobes have given you control. You're a different person
now. You don't deserve to be executed. <br>(Iko pushes against the forcefield.)<br>
IKO: I want to go back to my cell. <br>
SEVEN: You're free to remain here. <br>
IKO: Am I still sick? <br>
SEVEN: No, but <br>
IKO: Then I don't want special treatment. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Cargo
Bay one]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Mealtime. Iko is back in his cell.)<br>NEELIX: I'm glad to see you're feeling better. You must be hungry. Here you go. <br>
IKO: Give it to him. <br>(A prisoner across the gangway, probably Egrid.)<br>
NEELIX: He's already had his dinner. <br>
IKO: Please. <br>
NEELIX: All right.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
You wanted to see me. <br>
JANEWAY: We just received a response from the Nygeans. The family has
refused to consider the appeal. <br>
SEVEN: But the medical evidence <br>
JANEWAY: They won't look at it. <br>
YEDIQ: The family found the request insulting. <br>
SEVEN: Your government could insist that they review it. <br>
YEDIQ: We have laws that protect victims from emotional distress. <br>
SEVEN: In that case, we should grant Iko asylum aboard Voyager. <br>
YEDIQ: You agreed to work within the confines of our legal system. <br>
SEVEN: Your system is flawed. <br>
JANEWAY: That's enough, Seven. I assure you, we'll abide by the
family's decision. Now I need a moment alone with Seven, if you don't
mind. <br>(Yediq leaves.) <br>JANEWAY: We did everything we could to help him. <br>
SEVEN: We have to do more. <br>
JANEWAY: You barely know this man. Why are you so passionate about
helping him? <br>
SEVEN: I want to give him the same opportunity you gave me. When you
severed my link to the Collective, you changed who I was. You made it
possible for me to reclaim my humanity. Because of my nanoprobes, Iko
has undergone a similar change. He should be given the chance to atone
for his crimes. <br>
JANEWAY: Atonement. Is that what this is about? <br>
SEVEN: Yes. <br>
JANEWAY: For him, or for you? <br>
SEVEN: I don't know what you mean. <br>
JANEWAY: I think part of you still feels responsible for the violent
acts you committed when you were a Borg. <br>
SEVEN: You're mistaken. <br>
JANEWAY: Am I? Maybe you believe if Iko is found not guilty, somehow
you won't be guilty either. You said it yourself. You've reclaimed
your humanity. It's time you stopped blaming yourself for the crimes of
the Collective. <br>(Whumph!) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>

CHAKOTAY: An alien vessel just dropped out of warp and opened fire. <br>(The forcefields on the cells flicker.)<br>

transport one of the prisoners. <br>

JANEWAY: Target their transporter array. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Direct hit. They're retreating. <br>

JOLEG: You have five minutes to get us a shuttle. <br>
TUVOK: Tuvok to bridge. Lock on to Yediq's signature and beam him to <br>

phaser.) <br>
YEDIQ: I knew it was a trick. I knew you hadn't changed. <br>

She's beautiful, isn't she. <br>
SEVEN: Onella the Mother. <br>
IKO: And there's Paedos, still watching over her. It was kind of
Captain Janeway to let you bring me here. <br>
SEVEN: If your appeal is successful you'll be able to go wherever you
want. <br>
IKO: I hope you're right. <br>
SEVEN: If I am, where will you go? <br>
IKO: I don't know. <br>

you stay here. <br>
IKO: I'm not a scientist. I don't think I'd be much help to anyone. <br>
SEVEN: There are other ways to be useful. I'm sure we could think of
something. <br>

turns and looks at him. Iko leaves with Yediq and the guard. After a
moment, Janeway leaves too. She returns some time later.)<br>JANEWAY:
I just finished looking over your warp core analysis. <br>

JANEWAY: I'm impressed. It usually takes a few days to finish one of
these. B'Elanna tells me you did it in twenty two hours. <br>
SEVEN: I haven't felt the need to regenerate. <br>
JANEWAY: Everyone grieves in their own way. If you want to talk, you
know where to find me. <br>
SEVEN: It's unfair. <br>
JANEWAY: I think so too, Seven. But we have to try not to judge their
system. <br>
SEVEN: That's not what I meant. Iko was executed for taking a single
life. As a drone I took thousands, but I was never punished. <br>
JANEWAY: You lost twenty years of your life to the Borg. I'd say that's
punishment enough. </font> </p>
