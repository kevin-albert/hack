TUVOK: Your serve? <br>
JANEWAY: Tennis. After nineteen years I've decided to take it up again.
I'm a little rusty. I played in a novice tournament on the holodeck. I
lost my first match in straight sets. <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps if you maintained eye contact with the ball at the apex
of its trajectory, your serve would be more effective. <br>
JANEWAY: You play tennis. <br>
TUVOK: Simple physics, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Not as simple as when I played on the High School tennis team.
What can I do for you, Tuvok? <br>

JANEWAY: Report. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Some sort of spatial rift. It opened right in front of us. <br>
JANEWAY: Analysis. <br>
KIM: It's a distortion in the space-time continuum, but it's got a
graviton matrix. It's being artificially generated. <br>
CHAKOTAY: By whom? <br>
KIM: Sensors can't get inside. The distortion field's fluctuating.
Something's coming out. <br>
TUVOK: It appears to be a small ship, approximately six metres in
length. <br>
JANEWAY: Magnify. <br>
TUVOK: Sensors are reading one occupant, human. He is holding position
at the perimeter of the rift. <br>
KIM: There's a subspace signature emanating from the ship. Captain,
it's Federation! <br>
JANEWAY: Hail them. <br>
TUVOK: No response. They appear to be charging weapons. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Shields up! Hail them again. <br>
(Whumph!) <br>
TUVOK: Shields are down. <br>
JANEWAY: Get us out of here. <br>
PARIS: Helm control is offline. <br>
KIM: He's firing some kind of sub-atomic disruptor. <br>
JANEWAY: Return fire. <br>
TUVOK: Full phasers. No effect. <br>
KIM: Voyager's molecular structure is coming apart! <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok, divert all available power to the deflector. Send out
a high energy polaron pulse. It might help to disrupt his weapon. <br>
TUVOK: Emitting deflector pulse now. <br>
KIM: It's working. <br>
TUVOK: We are being hailed. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. <br>
BRAXTON [on viewscreen]: Starship Voyager, I'm Captain Braxton of the
Federation Timeship Aeon. I've come from twenty-ninth century Earth,
five hundred years into your future. Please disengage your deflector
pulse. <br>
JANEWAY: Why are you firing at us? <br>
BRAXTON [on viewscreen]: Your vessel is responsible for a disaster in
my century. A temporal explosion that will destroy all Earth's solar
system. I've come back in time to prevent that occurrence. My mission
is your destruction. You must not resist. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm going to need some more information before I allow you to <br>
BRAXTON [on viewscreen]: Debris from your secondary hull was found in
the explosion. <br>
JANEWAY: Captain, I simply <br>
BRAXTON [on viewscreen]: No time! <br>
(Whumph!) <br>
TUVOK: He's remodulating the sub-atomic disruptor. Our deflector is
losing power, it won't hold much longer. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, if he's telling the truth <br>
JANEWAY: I won't sacrifice this crew based on a ten second
conversation. I need proof. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It doesn't look like we're going to get it. <br>
JANEWAY: Adjust our deflector to match the frequency of his weapon. Try
to overload his emitter. <br>
TUVOK: It seems to be working. His weapon is offline and his ship has
been damaged. The rift is destabilising and he's being pulled back
inside. <br>
JANEWAY: Re-establish helm control. <br>
PARIS: I'm trying, Captain, but we seem to be caught in some kind of
graviton distortion. We're being pulled in too. <br>
(The two ships fall into the rift. After some shaking and a white-out,
in which everyone loses consciousness, they awake in normal space.) <br>
JANEWAY: Status. <br>
TUVOK: Primary systems are coming back online. The weapons array and
power grid took heavy damage. <br>
KIM: The temporal rift is closed. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Where are we? <br>
(The viewscreen shows a blue planet with white clouds.) <br>
PARIS: Home. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We just cut across half the galaxy! <br>
JANEWAY: The rift must have originated here. Hail Starfleet Command. <br>
TUVOK: No response on standard frequencies. Curious. I am picking up a
multitude of narrow band EM signals. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's hear it. <br>
(A cacophony of radio stations and telephone conversations.) <br>
JANEWAY: The question isn't where we are, it's when we are. Mister Kim.
<br>
KIM: According to astrometric readings the year is 1996. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The late twentieth century. <br>
PARIS: Captain, they had surveillance satellites during this time. <br>
JANEWAY: Maintain a high orbit. And modulate the shields to scatter
their radar. We don't want to alarm the natives. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What about the time ship? Is it here too? <br>
TUVOK: There is no sign of the vessel in orbit. Scanning the planet
surface. I am picking up low frequency subspace readings emanating from
the northern hemisphere. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Subspace technology shouldn't exist for another hundred years
or so. <br>
JANEWAY: It could be our friend from the twenty ninth century. Localise
it. <br>
TUVOK: North American continent, Pacific coast. The city of Los
Angeles. <br>
JANEWAY: We've got to go down there. If it is Captain Braxton, he's the
key to all this, and at the moment his ship is the only way we have of
getting back to our own century. Chakotay, Tuvok, Paris, you're with
me. Mister Kim, you have the bridge. <br>
KIM: Yes, Ma'am! <br>
JANEWAY: As I recall, Tom, you're something of an aficionado on
twentieth century America. <br>
PARIS: That's right. <br>
JANEWAY: What will we need to pass as locals in this era? <br>
PARIS: Simple. Nice clothes, fast car and lots of money. </font></p>

would have noticed. <br>
(They walk down the ramp.) <br>
JANEWAY: The subspace readings are coming from within a one hundred
metre radius of our position, but I can't pinpoint the source. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I find it hard to believe a ship from the twenty ninth
century could have landed on this beach without being noticed. <br>
JANEWAY: We have no idea what kind of technology they might have in the
future. Maybe it's cloaked. Let's spread out. Tuvok, Paris, go check
the shoreline. Chakotay and I will search the boardwalk. <br>
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Well, Kathryn, you got us home. <br>
JANEWAY: Right place, wrong time. But it is good to be back,
nevertheless. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe I should look up a few ancestors. As I recall, one of
them was a schoolteacher in Arizona. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't know what my relatives were doing this far back in
history. <br>
GIRL ON BLADES: Coming through. Sorry. <br>
JANEWAY: For all I know, she could be my great, great, great, great
grandmother. <br>
CHAKOTAY: She does have your legs. <br>
JANEWAY: Have you ever been to southern California, Chakotay? <br>
CHAKOTAY: No. <br>
JANEWAY: After the Hermosa quake in 2047 this entire region sank under
two hundred metres of water. It became one of the world's largest coral
reefs, home to thousands of different marine species. <br>

listen to me. Voyager. Fools! <br>

BRAXTON: I was a younger man, confident in my mission. But you wouldn't
listen to me. Bo, you were too concerned with yourselves! <br>

reaction that started with Voyager! It's too late now. All things are
set in motion. The terrible explosion will occur. The end is coming!
The future's end. <br>
JANEWAY: Captain, how long have you been here in the twentieth century?
<br>

CHAKOTAY: And yet we just arrived. Why? <br>
BRAXTON: Pure chance. When you knocked my navigational system off
course there's no telling where we may have ended up. Who's been here?
Who took my pencils? Oh, always something missing. Oh, always trying to
steal things. Oh, greedy people. Post-industrial barbarians! <br>
JANEWAY: Captain, we want to help you, but you've got to give us more
information. You said that Voyager causes the explosion. <br>
BRAXTON: Yes. No. Yes. That's the paradox, my dear. A leads to B leads
to C leads to A. Juvenile minds. Oh, how can I make you understand,
huh? A. There's an explosion in the twenty ninth century. Debris from
Voyager's hull is found in evidence. I go back in time to destroy you.
B. You try to stop me, disabling my weapon which causes me to
crash-land back here in the twentieth century. C. Someone in this
century steals my timeship and launches it. They go into the future and
once there they make one critical mistake which causes a terrible
explosion that takes us all the way back to A. There's an explosion in
the twenty ninth century. The cycle of causality is complete. <br>
JANEWAY: How do you know all this? What evidence do you have that it
will be your timeship that causes the disaster? <br>
(Braxton rummages for a piece of brown paper.) <br>
BRAXTON: Ah, I've spent thirty years answering that very question. Ah,
yes, when the explosion first happened, my sensors recorded a whole
variety of chronometric data. The pulses were highly chaotic. At first
I thought it was a warp core implosion, but then I found debris from
Voyager and my theory seemed to be confirmed. It was you. But then
someone here stole my timeship and it started to dawn on me. If someone
were to fly my timeship into the future without recalibrating the
temporal matrix then that could cause the kind of explosion that I
witnessed in the twenty ninth century. <br>
JANEWAY: So it really wasn't Voyager after all. <br>
BRAXTON: No. No, no, I reconstructed all the chronometric data as best
I could remember it and it proved I was right. My ship causes the
catastrophe. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Which raises the question, who has your timeship? <br>
BRAXTON: Starling. Henry Starling, CEO Chronowerx Industries.
Philanthropist, entrepreneur, outstanding citizen. Pa! Before I crashed
in 1967 I made an emergency beam out, but he found my ship before I did
in some remote mountain range. I've been following this corrupt little
man ever since, tracking his movements. He's become too powerful. I
can't get close to him. Of course, you can't accomplish anything in
this wretched century. Nobody here listens. Do you know that once they
put me in a mental institution and filled me with primitive
pharmaceuticals. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe we can help you find Starling and your ship, and get us
back to where we belong. <br>
BRAXTON: Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you. <br>
JANEWAY: Why not? <br>
BRAXTON: Haven't you been listening? A leads to B <br>
JANEWAY: Leads to C. Yes, we heard you. Why shouldn't we try to stop
Starling? <br>
BRAXTON: Because somehow you're involved in the disaster. That's why I
found debris from Voyager's hull at the explosion. You will be
destroyed as well. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Now that we know what's going to happen, maybe we can figure
out <br>
(A police car stops and sounds its siren.) <br>
POLICEMAN: Hey, Captain, how you doing? Understand you've been putting
these signs up around the city again. <br>
BRAXTON: No. No, no, no. Not me. I would never do that. <br>

BRAXTON: Stay right where you are, quasi-Cardassian totalitarian. <br>

about the signs. Now, there've been a few people complaining. <br>
