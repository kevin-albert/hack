JACK: Why are you so upset? You wanted Sarina brought here. Well, here
she is! <br>
(Sarina is sitting quietly on a biobed.) <br>
BASHIR: I was considering bringing Sarina here for treatment when I was
ready. But I still have to modify my surgical equipment before I can
begin the procedure. <br>
JACK: Well don't worry, we'll help you. And when we're through with
Sarina, she will be just like us. <br>
BASHIR: Do you have any idea how much trouble you could get into for
impersonating Starfleet officers? <br>
PATRICK: Jack, you didn't say anything about us getting in trouble. <br>
JACK: We didn't get caught, did we? <br>
BASHIR: Didn't anybody question you? <br>

Somehow. Hello, Sarina. Remember me? <br>

you want me to convince Starfleet not to press charges, you're going to
have to give me a damn good reason. <br>
BASHIR: They wanted to bring Sarina here so that I could help her. They
meant well. <br>
SISKO: They meant well? That's the same excuse you gave me when they
were caught trying to pass military secrets to the Dominion. <br>
BASHIR: They were trying to save lives by <br>
SISKO: Doctor, I appreciate that you feel a connection to them because
you're genetically engineered yourself, but they have displayed a
consistent disregard for the rules that the rest of society lives by. <br>
BASHIR: Maybe that's because they're not allowed to live in society. <br>
SISKO: We are not here to debate Federation policy toward the
genetically enhanced. We are here to discuss what to do about these
people now that they're aboard. <br>
BASHIR: Of course. Well, with your permission, sir, I would like to
proceed with Sarina's treatment. <br>
SISKO: Well, I take it the Institute has given the approval to move
forward? <br>
BASHIR: A copy of the medical protocols I submitted. Doctor Loews,
Sarina's legal guardian, has given her consent. <br>
SISKO: It appears that this procedure's never been done before. <br>
BASHIR: There's no guarantee that it'll work, of course, but if it does
it could change everything for her. There's no reason to think that
she's suffering from the same type of behavioural disorders as Jack and
the others. Her problem is that she's trapped inside her own mind. This
could free her. There are still a few technical issues that I have to
work on, but I feel confident that I can iron them all out. <br>
SISKO: You've put in a lot of time on this, haven't you? <br>
BASHIR: I owe it to her, sir. I could have ended up the same way as
Sarina, but I was lucky. My DNA re sequencing didn't have any
unintended side effects. <br>
SISKO: All right, Doctor. I'll take care of Starfleet, you take care of
Sarina. <br>
BASHIR: Thank you, sir. <br>
SISKO: I'll arrange to have the rest of the people sent back to the
Institute. <br>
BASHIR: Actually, I was hoping you'd allow let them to stay on for a
while. <br>
SISKO: For what reason? <br>
BASHIR: Sarina's spent the last fifteen years with them. Now, assuming
the procedure works and she comes out of her isolation, I think it
would be helpful to have some familiar faces around. <br>
SISKO: Well, we'll arrange for quarters to be set up in a cargo bay. <br>
BASHIR: I appreciate it. <br>
SISKO: Just make sure they stay there. I don't want them to get out and
cause trouble like they did the last time. <br>
BASHIR: I'll see that it doesn't happen again. <br>
SISKO: I'll hold you to that. One thing more. Get them out of those

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Infirmary]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: Sarina's cerebral cortex was genetically
enhanced in order to accelerate the rate at which she can process
information. Now, the only problem is, her visual and auditory systems
can't channel the stimuli into the cortex fast enough. So because
they're out of sync, she can't focus on what's going on around her. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, is there any way to get her sensory processes up to
speed? <br>
BASHIR: I need to stimulate the growth of new synapses in the thalamus.
Which means I have to manipulate neural proteins at a subatomic level. <br>
O'BRIEN: Then you've got a problem. This is the most advanced
neurocortical probe made, and it's not nearly that accurate. <br>
BASHIR: Now you know why I asked you down here. <br>
O'BRIEN: I wish I could help you, Julian, but at resolutions that
small, quantum fluctuations are impossible to control. And I can't make
this thing any more accurate. <br>
BASHIR: How can you say that before you've even tried it? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm sorry, Julian. It can't be done. I'm sorry. <br>
BASHIR: Well sorry just isn't good enough, Miles. This is Sarina's only
chance at living a normal life. <br>
O'BRIEN: Julian, I can't break the laws of physics. Nobody can.

and lots of wires.) <br>

could clip the wings of an angel dancing on the head of a pin. If you
wanted to.

EZRI: I'm sorry. Obviously you want to punish yourself. Do you want
help? Because I'm really good at punishing myself. Let's see. If I were

getting people's hopes up. For being arrogant enough to think that I
could help Sarina even though dozens of other doctors have failed.

odd. Her norepinephrine levels are slightly elevated. <br>
EZRI: What's causing it? <br>
BASHIR: I'm not sure. <br>

drop when the new thalamic connections stabilise. <br>

SARINA: I remember you. You're Julian's best friend. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, we get on all right. <br>
BASHIR: For the most part. <br>
SARINA: Why are you pretending that it's not true? <br>
EZRI: Because they're men. And men have trouble expressing their
feelings. <br>
SARINA: You don't. <br>
KIRA: Oh, are you kidding? Odo never talks about his feelings. <br>
SARINA: He took your hand. He's showing you his feelings. <br>
ODO: Thank you. <br>
O'BRIEN: Julian, why don't you show everybody how much you love me and
order the next round. <br>
BASHIR: Hey, Broik.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Promenade - upper level]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SARINA: I liked your friends. All of them. If I had
to find someone to replace Atlas and hold up the world, it'd be Miles.
He'd do it with a smile, too. And Kira, she never doubts herself, which
is what Odo finds so fascinating because he doubts everything but her. <br>
BASHIR: What about Ezri? <br>
SARINA: The day she realises she's more than just the sum of her parts,
she's really going to be something. <br>
BASHIR: I can't believe you saw all that after just a few hours with
them. I'm going to have to start putting on my poker face. <br>
SARINA: Too late. You've already given yourself away. <br>
BASHIR: Is that right? And how would you describe me? <br>
SARINA: Compassionate. Brilliant. Lonely. <br>
BASHIR: Well, two out of three isn't bad. <br>
SARINA: Which two? <br>
BASHIR: Now that would be telling. I'm glad you liked my friends. I
know they liked you. <br>
SARINA: I felt so comfortable around them. I didn't have to worry that
someone was going to throw a tantrum, or break into tears all of a
sudden. <br>
BASHIR: They only usually do that at staff meetings. <br>
SARINA: Jack's always talking about how we're better than normal
people. He says that's why they keep us locked up. But he's wrong. He
couldn't get by in the real world. He'd get himself into too much
trouble. So would Lauren and Patrick. <br>
BASHIR: That's why they belong in the Institute. In fact, Doctor Loews
wants me to get them back there as soon as possible. <br>
SARINA: I'm not going with them, am I. <br>
BASHIR: You don't belong there. Not anymore. <br>
SARINA: Do they know? <br>
BASHIR: Not yet. <br>
SARINA: They've been like a family to me for as long as I can remember.
<br>
BASHIR: I know how much you care about them. <br>
SARINA: As difficult as they can be sometimes, I'm going to miss them.
We had our own little world, just the four of us. So, what's a
genetically enhanced girl supposed to do when she wakes up from a long
sleep? Point to one of those little specks of light out there, pack her
bag, and go make a life for herself? <br>
BASHIR: Why does she have to go anywhere at all? <br>
(And Bashir kisses Sarina.)

JACK: You have no right to do this. No right! <br>
BASHIR: Look, I know you're going to miss her, but it's the best thing
for Sarina. <br>
JACK: We did not help you so you could take her away from us! <br>
BASHIR: Stop thinking about yourself for a second, Jack, and think
about her. Face it. She doesn't belong with you anymore. <br>
JACK: Why? Because we're not normal? Because we're crazy? <br>
BASHIR: Oh, Jack. <br>
PATRICK: Couldn't you make us normal like you did for Sarina, and then
we could all stay together. <br>
LAUREN: Go on, Julian. Tell him. There's nothing you can do for us.
We're too far gone. <br>
JACK: Oh, who wants to be normal anyway? We're better than they are.
You don't see any of them trying to save the universe from collapsing,
do you? Let's get back to work.

BASHIR: Explain how you track the dependent variables. <br>
SARINA: It's really not that interesting. <br>

QUARK: Well, hasn't this been fun. Why not take a seat and top off the
evening with a lovely bottle of spring wine? <br>

tired. <br>
BASHIR: I'll tell you what. Tomorrow night why don't we have a nice
quiet dinner in my quarters. I have a week's leave coming up. I thought
we might go to Risa together, get away from all the distractions around
here, spend a little time alone. <br>

BASHIR: She's wonderful, Miles. I've never met anyone like her. She's
brilliant, sweet, everything's new to her. Being with her is so
refreshing. She takes such delight in what she's experiencing. It makes
me appreciate things I usually take for granted. <br>

O'BRIEN: Yes. Yeah. Coffee, music, stars. <br>
BASHIR: Well, don't you have anything to say? <br>
O'BRIEN: As a matter of fact, I do, Julian. I haven't seen you like
this for a long time, and I'm really happy for you. But don't you think
it's all happening a little fast? <br>
BASHIR: We're genetically engineered. We do everything fast. <br>
O'BRIEN: Julian, she's your patient. <br>
BASHIR: Not anymore. I've asked Doctor Girani to take over her care.
Miles, I don't think you understand what this means to me. All these
years I've had to hide the fact that my DNA had been resequenced. I'd
listen to people talk about the genetically engineered, saying they
were all misfits. I used to fantasise about meeting someone who was
like me, who could live a normal life. But it never happened. Until
Sarina. Don't you see? She's the woman I've been waiting for all my
life. <br>
