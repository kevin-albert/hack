LEETA: Excuse me. You're Doctor Bashir, aren't you? <br>
BASHIR: That's right. <br>
LEETA: I'm Leeta. I've been meaning to come by the Infirmary to see
you. (cough, cough.) <br>
BASHIR: Oh, dear. How long have you had that cough? <br>
LEETA: A few days now. <br>
BASHIR: May I? (puts his hand on her back) Cough for me. <br>
(Leeta forces a couple more fake coughs.) <br>
BASHIR: Hmm. <br>
LEETA: Is it serious, Doctor? <br>
BASHIR: No, but it's a good thing you came to me when you did. We need
to start your treatment immediately. (to waiter) Bring me a Fanalian
toddy, very hot. Make that two. I'm feeling a bit of a cough coming on
myself. <br>
LEETA: I'm sorry to hear that, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: No, please, call me <br>

DAX: How nice of you to put it together for me so quickly. I think I'll
go over it right now. Oh, by the way, I hear the Lexington's docking

SISKO: Hey, Jake-o! <br>
JAKE: Hey, Dad. <br>
(Sisko drops off his bag in his bedroom and comes back.) <br>
SISKO: Hey. <br>
JAKE: What is this? <br>
SISKO: I just thought it was time for a change. What do you think? <br>
JAKE: I like it. How was Bajor? <br>
SISKO: Beautiful. You should've come with me. <br>
JAKE: The re-opening of some old library isn't exactly my idea of a
good time. <br>
SISKO: This wasn't just some old library. We're talking about the most
extensive collection of Bajoran antiquities on the planet. I saw
manuscripts that date back to before the fall of the First Republic. <br>
JAKE: Great. <br>
SISKO: Here. Look at this. <br>
(Sisko shows Jake a PADD with a blueprint on it.) <br>
JAKE: What is this, some kind of ship? <br>
SISKO: According to legend, the ancient Bajorans used ships like these
to explore their star system eight hundred years ago <br>
JAKE: You mean that when humans were first sailing across the oceans,
Bajorans were already going to other planets? <br>
SISKO: Some scholars say they made it all the way to Cardassia. <br>
JAKE: That seems hard to believe. What are these? <br>
SISKO: Solar sails. These ships were propelled by light pressure. <br>
JAKE: Like a sailboat catching the wind. <br>
SISKO: Exactly. <br>
JAKE: I wonder if a ship like that could really fly? <br>
SISKO: I don't know. That's why I'm going to build one. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cargo bay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: I'm expecting a lumber shipment from Bajor
this afternoon. <br>
O'BRIEN: Okay. <br>
SISKO: Which reminds me. I'll need a sabre saw. <br>
O'BRIEN: A sabre saw? <br>
SISKO: You know, to cut wood. <br>
O'BRIEN: Why not use a laser cutter? <br>
SISKO: Oh, no. I want to use the same types of tools the Bajorans had.
This will do fine, Major. As soon as these cargo containers are out of
the way, I'll start construction. <br>
O'BRIEN: Sir, I've looked over the specifications you brought back from
Bajor. I'm not sure this design is spaceworthy, and I'm positive a ship
like this could never have made it from Bajor to Cardassia. <br>
KIRA: Now why would you say that? <br>
O'BRIEN: At sublight speeds, the trip would've taken them years, and
that's assuming ideal conditions. One unexpected ion storm in the
Denorias Belt would've torn the sails to pieces and left them stranded.
<br>
KIRA: Well, maybe they were lucky and they didn't go into any storms. <br>
O'BRIEN: I just don't see how this ship could've made the trip. They
didn't even have replicators back then. They would've had to store
their air supply and there's only enough room on board for a few weeks
worth. <br>
KIRA: Well maybe they recycled it somehow, used some kind of
photosynthetic plant. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yeah, maybe. <br>
KIRA: Oh, you sound just like a Cardassian. <br>
O'BRIEN: I beg your pardon? <br>
KIRA: They've denied the possibility of ancient contact for decades
because they cannot stand the idea of Bajor having interstellar flight
before they did. <br>
O'BRIEN: With all due respect, Major, you're beginning to sound like a
Romulan. <br>
KIRA: A Romulan? <br>
O'BRIEN: There is no piece of technology in existence they don't claim
they invented before everyone else. <br>
SISKO: Look, I don't plan to spend the next few years sailing to
Cardassia. All I want is to build one of these ships and prove that
it's spaceworthy. <br>
O'BRIEN: A computer model could do that. And why go to all that
trouble? <br>
SISKO: Why? Because it'll be fun. <br>
(After vignettes of Sisko welding, Sisko moving solar panels, pouring
over the blueprints, putting heavy components into place, testing the
iris opening for the porthole, more welding.) <br>
SISKO: Oh, yes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sisko's quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(At a meal.) <br>
SISKO: You know, I've been thinking. According to the star charts, the
most difficult part of the trip between Bajor and Cardassia would be
getting through the Denorias Belt. After that, it would be smooth
sailing the rest of the way. <br>
JAKE: Really. <br>
SISKO: Just making that part of the trip would go a long way towards
demonstrating that the Bajorans could have made the journey to
Cardassia. <br>
JAKE: Seems reasonable. <br>
SISKO: It should only take about four, five days. <br>
JAKE: That's not so long. <br>
SISKO: So? <br>
JAKE: What? <br>
SISKO: So what do you say you come with me? We'll have a great time.
The ship will be ready to go in another week. <br>
JAKE: That's when Leanne is supposed to get back from Bajor. I really
want to see her, and I don't know how long she's going to be here. <br>
SISKO: Oh, well. If you can't do it, you can't do it. <br>
JAKE: I'd like to, but it's just not good timing, you know? <br>
SISKO: Sure. I understand.

Verne would love this spaceship.)<br>
DAX: Hi. <br>
SISKO: Hello Jadzia. <br>
DAX: I brought you something to eat. <br>
SISKO: Oh, thank you. Let me just finish this welding and I'll take a
break. <br>
DAX: Benjamin, I can't believe the work you've put into this. <br>
SISKO: I'm just following the blueprints. <br>
DAX: But you didn't have to bother with detail like this to prove the
ship is spaceworthy. <br>
SISKO: Oh, I suppose not, but I want everything to be just right. It's
an exact replica, you know, except for the gravity net I installed in
the floor. Weightlessness makes me queasy. <br>
DAX: I haven't seen you like this for a long time. <br>
SISKO: Like what? <br>
DAX: So caught up in something, so excited. Not since, not since you
and Jennifer decided to have a baby. <br>
SISKO: The nursery. <br>
DAX: I don't think anyone's ever put such effort into making a room for
their child. <br>
SISKO: Well, you have to admit it turned out pretty well. <br>
DAX: Especially the starscape on the ceiling. <br>
SISKO: Jake loved that ceiling. In fact, when we moved out of the
house, he couldn't understand why we couldn't bring it with us. <br>
DAX: You're disappointed he's not going with you on this trip, aren't
you? <br>
SISKO: Oh, he has other things he'd rather be doing, friends he'd
rather be with. It's funny. A year or two ago, nothing would've stopped
him from coming with me on an adventure like this. I guess I waited too
long. <br>
DAX: You'll have other adventures, Benjamin. They'll just be different.
Believe me, I know. I've been a father a couple of times, myself. Oh, I
could tell you stories. <br>
SISKO: You already have. <br>
DAX: That's right. I have, haven't I? Then you know I'm right.

BASHIR: Absolutely. We were neck and neck right until the final exam.
Then I blew it. That's how she wound up on the Lexington, a post which
virtually everyone in our graduating class was hoping for. <br>

a trip. <br>
SISKO: Word gets around. <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: I can't believe that a man of your intelligence
would take stock in Bajoran fairy tales about ancient contact. <br>
SISKO: If you recall, you thought the Celestial Temple was a Bajoran
fairy tale, until we discovered the wormhole. <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: I suggest you reconsider your plans. Solar
vessels are very fragile, and it's a long way to the Denorias Belt at
sublight speeds. <br>
SISKO: Don't worry. I'll have emergency equipment on board. If
something goes wrong, Major Kira can have a runabout to me within an
hour. <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: An hour can be a long time, especially if you
happen to encounter something unexpected. <br>
SISKO: Like what? <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: Oh, I don't know. A Maquis ship perhaps. <br>
SISKO: Why would the Maquis have any quarrel with an unarmed ship
sailing toward the Denorias Belt. They have nothing at stake here.
Nothing to prove, or should I say, disprove. <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: Commander, I contacted you out of concern for
your safety, but you seem to be intimating that I've made some sort of
threat. <br>
SISKO: Ah. Then I'm glad I was wrong. For a moment there I thought that
you had been put in charge of the Cardassian Ministry for the
Refutation of Bajoran Fairy Tales. <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: Since I don't seem to be able to dissuade you
from undertaking this little voyage of yours, I'll wish you luck
instead. Let's hope you don't need it.

SISKO: Yes. It was designed for a zero-gravity environment. <br>
JAKE: How am I suppose to? How are you supposed to, er? <br>
SISKO: You'll get the hang of it. We'll be tacking against the light
most of the way, and then we'll run like this for about ninety minutes
or so, then come about and I'll calculate the next leg of our trip. How
about something to drink? <br>
JAKE: Yeah, sure. (Sisko throws him a plastic bag.) Don't tell me we
only have zero-gravity rations. <br>

SISKO: Exactly. Not even the hum of an engine. It's almost like being
on the deck of an old sailing ship, except the stars are not just up in
the sky, they're all around us. Imagine how the ancient Bajorans must
have felt, heading into space in a ship like this one, not knowing what
they were going to find or who they were going to meet. Jake, I know
that you really didn't want to come on this trip. I just want to say
I'm glad you're here. <br>

hers who knows someone at the school and <br>

starboard sprit is fouling one of the mainsails. <br>

SISKO: I don't think so. We're going to have to jettison the sprit.
Let's fall off a little, take some pressure off the sails. Lock that
down and give me a hand. One more turn. Lock it. Good work. I'm going
to jettison the sprit. <br>
(A small explosion sends the sail away from the ship.) <br>
SISKO: That's better, but we're still getting a lot of spill off the
sails. We won't be able to make much headway with each tack. I don't
think we'll be able to get to the Denorias Belt like this. <br>

take my seat at the table just like I had come down the stairs. <br>
JAKE: You must have used up a month's worth of transporter credits. <br>
SISKO: My parents, they never said anything about it. Just 'how you
doing, son, how was school today? They knew that I would get over being
homesick soon enough. And after about the fifth, sixth day, you could
pry me from that campus. Of course now, if you go to Pennington, you
won't be able to beam back to the station to have dinner with your old
man. After about a week or so, you'll get over it. <br>
JAKE: It's not me I'm worried about. It's you. <br>
SISKO: Me? <br>
JAKE: If I go, you'll be all alone. <br>
SISKO: Oh, I appreciate you thinking about me, Jake, but please don't
turn down this opportunity on my account. I'll have plenty of people to
keep me company. I can always eat dinner with Dax, or Doctor Bashir, or
even Quark. <br>
JAKE: I guess, but I'd feel a lot better if you had someone. You know,
someone special, like a girlfriend. <br>
SISKO: I see. <br>
JAKE: Let's face it. It's been over a year since your last date. A
year, Dad. You've got to make time for these things. <br>
SISKO: I cannot believe that I'm getting advice about women from my
son. <br>
JAKE: Don't think of me as your son right now. Just think of me as
another guy. Another guy who happens to know a very attractive lady who
wants to meet you. <br>
SISKO: You are trying to set me up? <br>
JAKE: Well why not? <br>
(Big crash.) <br>
JAKE: What was that? <br>
SISKO: I'm not sure, but whatever hit us almost tore off the port
mainsail. <br>
(The stars start streaking by in a familiar way.) <br>
SISKO: Main power's offline. We're moving at warp. <br>
JAKE: How can that be? <br>
SISKO: I don't know. <br>
(And it stops) <br>
JAKE: What happened? <br>
SISKO: That's a good question. (checks the star chart) There's no
record of any spatial anomalies in this region. <br>
JAKE: What are these? <br>
SISKO: Tachyon eddies. They run all through this area. <br>
JAKE: Could we have gotten caught up in one? <br>
SISKO: No, tachyons don't have enough mass to affect a ship of. This
isn't an ordinary ship. It has a lot more surface area relative to its
mass. <br>
JAKE: Because of the sails. <br>
SISKO: And since tachyons travel faster than light, it could be that
their impact on the sails somehow accelerated us to warp speeds. We
could be light years off course. <br>
JAKE: The question is, where did we end up? <br>
SISKO: You check the rigging. I'll try to figure that out. <br>
JAKE: We lost the jib and port mainsail. <br>
(And the sextant is broken.) <br>
SISKO: Damn. <br>
JAKE: What? <br>
SISKO: It's useless. Now we can't figure out where we are or where
we're going. Guess we'll have to contact the station, let them know
they have to come and get us. <br>
JAKE: We were so close. Another day and we would have made it to the
Denorias Belt. <br>
SISKO: Hey, we did pretty well getting as far as we did. <br>
JAKE: Is something wrong? <br>
SISKO: The station's not responding. <br>
JAKE: Is the comm. unit damaged? <br>
SISKO: Not as far as I can see. Maybe they haven't received our message
yet <br>
JAKE: You think we could have been carried that far away from the
station? <br>
SISKO: I suppose it's possible. <br>
JAKE: Well, they'll find us eventually, right? <br>
SISKO: Sure. </font></p>

going straight to Elizabeth's table.) <br>
BASHIR: Excuse me. <br>
LENSE: Yes? <br>
BASHIR: We were to medical school together. Julian Bashir. <br>
LENSE: You're Bashir? <br>
BASHIR: You sound surprised. <br>
LENSE: Well, I thought you were Andorian. <br>
BASHIR: Andorian? <br>
LENSE: Someone pointed out an Andorian to me at a party and said that
that was Julian Bashir. It was New Year's Eve at Bruce Lucier's, four
years ago. <br>
BASHIR: I did go to that party. May I? <br>
LENSE: Yes. <br>
(Bashir sits.) <br>
BASHIR: With my friend, Erit. He's Andorian. (to waiter) No, thank you.
<br>
LENSE: I must've gotten you mixed up. All these years, I thought you
were someone else. <br>
BASHIR: Didn't you see me give my speech at graduation? <br>
LENSE: No, I was backstage waiting to give my speech. I was so nervous
I almost passed out. <br>
BASHIR: I know the feeling. <br>
LENSE: So. You gave me quite a run for my money. If it hadn't been for
that pre-ganglionic fibre <br>
BASHIR: You know about that? <br>
LENSE: I know that if you hadn't got that wrong you would be
valedictorian. <br>
BASHIR: Well, I never got a chance to congratulate you. <br>
LENSE: Seems like a long time ago, doesn't it? <br>
BASHIR: Not so long. So, you got the Lexington. You must have had quite
an adventure, exploring uncharted space, meeting fascinating new races
with fascinating new diseases. <br>
LENSE: Actually, it ended up being more of a charting expedition.
Sometimes it would be months between planetary systems. You wouldn't
believe how excited I would get if we actually found something living,
even if it was just moss under a rock. Don't take this the wrong way
but, there were times when I regretted not taking your assignment. <br>
BASHIR: Really. <br>
LENSE: I read your paper on the immuno-therapy project you've been
doing on Bajor. It was brilliant. <br>
BASHIR: Thank you. <br>
LENSE: I really envy the opportunity you have to work on that kind of
long-term project. On the Lexington, it was collect your samples and
then on to the next system. <br>
BASHIR: I suppose I was lucky. <br>
LENSE: What's happening on Bajor? Were you able to get the T-cell
anomalies under control? <br>
BASHIR: If you're really that interested, we should go to the Infirmary
and I can show you my latest results. <br>
LENSE: I'd love it. <br>
(So they leave together, smiling. Leaning over the upper rail - ) <br>
QUARK: Morn, about that bet. I believe the odds were three to one.

sextant.) <br>
JAKE: So, Dad, we're not going to run out of air or anything, are we? <br>
SISKO: Don't worry, somebody'll find us before that happens. So, tell
me about this woman you want me to meet? <br>
JAKE: Well, she's a freighter captain. <br>
SISKO: A freighter captain? <br>
JAKE: Dad, trust me, you'll like her. <br>
SISKO: All right, I'll agree to meet her on one condition. <br>
JAKE: What? <br>
SISKO: That you agree not to base your decision about going to
Pennington on how our date turns out. <br>
JAKE: Don't worry, I won't. I've already decided to wait at least a
year. <br>
SISKO: Why? <br>
JAKE: Well, I've heard that you can only write about what you've
experienced. And you've got to admit, Deep Space Nine is a pretty good
place to get experience. <br>
(Jake looks out of the porthole.) <br>
JAKE: Dad! <br>
(Three Cardassian warships.) <br>
SISKO: It appears we've got company. <br>
JAKE: What do you think they want? <br>
(Comm. beep) <br>
SISKO: Looks like we're about to find out. What can I do for you,
Dukat? <br>
DUKAT [on screen]: Well, I wanted to be the first one to congratulate
you. <br>
SISKO: Congratulate me? <br>
DUKAT [on screen]: On managing to make it all the way here. <br>
SISKO: All the way where? <br>
DUKAT [on screen]: Don't you know? You've just entered the Cardassian
system. <br>
JAKE: The tachyon eddy. It must've taken us past the Denorias Belt and
brought us here. <br>
SISKO: The same thing must've happened to the ancient Bajorans. <br>
JAKE: We did it! We proved the trip was possible. <br>
DUKAT [on screen]: I hate to interrupt your celebration, Commander, but
I've been asked to convey a message from the Cardassian Government.
(reads) Your voyage is a testament to the spirit of the ancient
Bajorans who first ventured out into space. It could not be more
appropriate that your arrival coincides with the discovery here on
Cardassia of an ancient crash site, a site that our archaeologists
believe contains the remnants of one of the Bajoran vessels whose
journey you have just recreated. <br>
SISKO: What an amazing coincidence. <br>
DUKAT [on screen]: Yes, isn't it. Welcome. <br>
