are also very non-Janeway and there is no comm. badge.)<br>pJANEWAY:
When diplomacy fails there's only one alternative. Violence. Force must
be applied without apology. It's the Starfleet way. <br>
DALETH: Then our philosophies are in agreement. Will you help us? <br>
pJANEWAY: You're asking me to fight your war, destroy your enemy. <br>
DALETH: I'm asking you to intimidate the Kyrians with your technology.
Help me capture their leader. This ship has superior firepower. He
won't risk a conflict with you. <br>
pJANEWAY: We risk life and limb so your people can annex Kyrian land.
Sounds like a good deal for you. What do we get? <br>
DALETH: A way home. <br>

where it is, and we can help you stabilise it. <br>

territories. The Doctor's nearly done working on the weapon. <br>

QUARREN: The warship Voyager. One of the most powerful vessels of its
time. Armed with photonic torpedoes and particle weapons, this ship of
destruction could wipe out an entire civilisation within hours. On this
particular day in history, we were lucky. The death toll could have
been much worse. By the time Voyager targeted our major cities, Tedran
had already begun an evacuation. Thousands of lives were saved.
Unfortunately, it was only the beginning of Captain Janeway's
onslaught. As you'll see, her actions would have a lasting effect on
our world. Even today, seven hundred years later, we are still feeling
the impact of the Voyager encounter. Before we continue the simulation,
I'd like to answer any questions you might have. <br>
KYRIAN VISITOR: I'm curious about Voyager itself. How many people were
on board? <br>
QUARREN: We believe they had a complement of over three hundred
soldiers. <br>
KYRIAN VISITOR: Did they attack other worlds as well? <br>
QUARREN: Well, we aren't certain. Records of Voyager's travels through
our quadrant are incomplete, but it's safe to assume that they
interfered with many other cultures, yes. <br>
KYRIAN VISITOR: Tell us more about the Borg drones they kept on the
ship. <br>
QUARREN: Voyager had many weapons at their disposal, including species
they'd assimilated along the way. Borg, Talaxian, Kazon. They were
captured and made to work as part of Voyager's fighting force. Let's
resume the simulation, and you can see for yourself. It's a few hours
after the initial bombardment. Janeway and her squadron are on the
bridge mounting their assault. Now, what you are about to see is
graphic
and unsettling. </font></p>

pJANEWAY: Status. Status! <br>
pNEELIX: Approximately three thousand Kyrians dead. <br>
pJANEWAY: That's it? <br>
pTUVOK: The bio-agent is still dispersing through the atmosphere. The
fatality rate will be three hundred thousand soon enough. <br>
pJANEWAY: How soon? <br>
pTUVOK: Best guess, one hour. <br>
pJANEWAY: Why do you always keep me waiting, Tuvok? <br>
pTUVOK: My apologies. Preparing to fire again. <br>
pJANEWAY: Double the yield, <br>
DALETH: Captain, don't you think that's excessive? <br>
pJANEWAY: You picked a bad time to have second thoughts, Ambassador. <br>
DALETH: I want them defeated but, but this is genocide! <br>
pJANEWAY: Defeat? Genocide? Why quibble with semantics? <br>
DALETH: This wasn't our agreement. <br>
pJANEWAY: We're going to defeat the Kyrians, and you're going to keep
up your end of the bargain. <br>(Whumph!)<br>pJANEWAY: Ensign, confine this gentleman to the brig.

pCHAKOTAY: I'm a man of peace. My native people are enlightened,

you. If we can work together maybe we can end this conflict. <br>

more effective than your crude attempts at persuasion. <br>(The evil EMH injects the Kyrian.)<br>pEMH: No doubt you are experiencing a tingling sensation behind your eyes.

QUARREN: The ensuing conflict was brief but brutal. Two million Kyrians
slaughtered within days. The warship Voyager continued on its way,
leaving the Kyrian dynasty in ruins. The Vaskan leaders proceeded to
occupy our lands, forcing my people into subservience. It took
centuries for us to undo the damage that Captain Janeway had done, and
the Kyrian struggle for equality is far from over. This simulation and
this museum are a testament to that struggle. I hope you found your
experience here worthwhile. If you'd like to learn more about Voyager
and its role in the history of our planet, I suggest you explore the
rest of this exhibit. Thank you for your time. <br>(One
of the exhibits is a photon torpedo case clearly labelled U.S.S.
Voyager. Later, a Vaskan man has his fingers in the torpedo's controls.)<br>QUARREN:&nbsp;Please, feel free to
test the simulators. I wouldn't touch that if I were you. One of the
Voyager's torpedoes. Twenty five isoton yield. It could destroy an
entire city within seconds. It's been inactive for centuries but you
never know. I'm only teasing, but please be careful. If we damage any
of these relics they can never be replaced. The history of our people
should be respected. <br>
VASKAN VISITOR: I have a question about that history.<br>
QUARREN: Please. <br>
VASKAN VISITOR: How can you prove that it's true? <br>
QUARREN: Take a closer look. The evidence is all around you. <br>
VASKAN VISITOR: Some musty fossils and a recreation? That doesn't
prove anything. <br>
QUARREN: I disagree. <br>
VASKAN VISITOR: You're trying to blame the Vaskans for all your
troubles the way you always do. I don't have a problem with your
species. I have Kyrian friends. But I don't appreciate seeing my people
being portrayed as villains in your little simulation, and I certainly
don't want your history taught to my children. <br>
QUARREN: You'd better get used to the idea, because we've just uncovered
an artefact that's going to confirm everything you've seen here. Three
weeks ago our research team found a data storage device buried nine
metres beneath the ruins at Kesef. I've confirmed that it came from
Voyager. <br>
VASKAN VISITOR: Another fossil. <br>
QUARREN: The device contains active data. Possibly crew logs, even
Captain Janeway's personal almanac. In the next few days, we could be
hearing Voyager's version of these events in their own words. <br>
VASKAN VISITOR: And what if those words tell a different story? What
then? <br>
QUARREN: We will change our views accordingly. <br>

the Voyager data storage device. I've decided to try using period tools
from the simulation itself. With any luck, they'll be more compatible.
Hmm. There's far more data here than I expected. Seems more like a
programme of some sort. Yes. Yes, it's an optronic datastream. A

It's a simulation. <br>

QUARREN: Please, let me try to explain. <br>

QUARREN: You are a hologram. <br>
EMH: That I know. <br>
QUARREN: I just discovered your programme inside this data storage
device. <br>
EMH: That's the EMH backup module. One of your attack parties must have
taken it from Sickbay. <br>
QUARREN: Actually, we found it at the ruins at Kesef. I know this will
be difficult for you to accept, but a great deal of time has passed
since Voyager encountered the Kyrians. <br>
EMH: How much time? <br>
QUARREN: Seven hundred years, give or take a decade. We're not certain.
<br>
EMH: I don't believe you. <br>
QUARREN: Think about it. When your programme is inactive, a moment or a
millennium are the same to you. <br>
EMH: Seven hundred years? What about my ship? What happened to my crew?
<br>
QUARREN: No one knows. It's safe to say they're long dead. <br>
EMH: And I'm some sort of fossil? <br>
QUARREN: No, not a fossil. A witness. A living witness to history.
There's so much we don't know about what happened. But you saw it, you
lived through those times. You helped to shape them. Doctor, you could
be the most important discovery of all time. <br>

Cyrik ocean, which was badly damaged by corrosion. We were bound to get a few
details wrong. <br>

nightmare. What if I'm found guilty? What's going to happen to me? <br>

severe. Your programme could be de-compiled. <br>

tactics. It was about a dilemma we were facing. We had negotiated a
trade agreement with the Vaskans. We were dealing with a
representative, Ambassador <br>
QUARREN: Ambassador Daleth. <br>
EMH: Daleth. Exactly. Everything was going according to plan until we
were attacked. By your people, the Kyrians. They'd picked that moment to
start a war and we were caught in the middle. <br>
QUARREN: The Kyrians were the aggressors? No, no. That can't be right. <br>
EMH: Captain Janeway called this meeting to figure out how we could
extricate ourselves from the conflict and still maintain the trade
agreement with the Vaskans. But we weren't on their side, and we
certainly never attacked you. <br>

QUARREN: Shutting down your programme. <br>

the artefact you have on display. If you just let me<br>(Quarren deactivates the EMH.)<br>

QUARREN: Begin dictation. I've re-examined the data module. From what I
can tell, the Doctor was telling the truth, at least about one thing.
He is a hologram. A backup programme. We always knew he was an
artificial lifeform but, we thought he was an android. If we were
mistaken about that, I wonder if we might also be wrong about Voyager
itself. Another question. Why would a hologram designed for medical
purposes be programmed to lie so readily? From the moment I activated
him, this Doctor has insisted that he's innocent. At first I didn't
believe him. End dictation. </font></p>

Please state the nature of the medical. Oh, it's you. <br>
QUARREN: You've given me a lot to think about. <br>
EMH: Really? I thought you'd heard enough of my lies. <br>
QUARREN: I judged you too quickly. I'm sorry. <br>
EMH: What changed your mind? <br>
QUARREN: Time to think. <br>
EMH: For your information, I don't appreciate being deactivated in the
middle of a sentence. It brings back unpleasant memories. <br>
QUARREN: It won't happen again. <br>
EMH: Good, because if you don't stop treating me like a second-class
hologram, I won't cooperate with your investigation. I'm perfectly
happy to lie dormant in that module for a few eons. <br>
QUARREN: I didn't come here to argue. <br>
EMH: Then what do you want? <br>
QUARREN: I don't know. To talk, I guess, about what really happened
seven hundred years ago. <br>
EMH: Are you sure you're willing to listen to a mass-murderer like me? <br>
QUARREN: I'm willing to keep an open mind. That's the most I can
promise. Try to understand my point of view. All my life, I thought I
knew the truth. There was never any doubt. <br>
EMH: I never meant to throw your beliefs into doubt, but I can't deny
what I know to be true. <br>
QUARREN: I realise that now, and I want to know the truth. And I want
the Arbiters to know it, too. <br>
EMH: Well, the stage is certainly set, but I'll have to rewrite the
characters and revise the plot a little. I'm quite adept in the art of
holographic programming. If you'll give me access to your technology,
maybe I can create a simulation of own. Show you what happened. </font></p>

DALETH: I'll transport the canisters immediately. It would be in your

pJANEWAY: We were trading with them, nothing more. <br>
TEDRAN: You expect me to believe that? You plan to use this ship to
destroy us. <br>
DALETH: We wouldn't need help if we wanted to destroy you. <br>
pJANEWAY: We didn't realise you were fighting with the Vaskans. Now,

pEMH: He's dead.<br>(The Arbiters are also present.)<br>
EMH: Computer, freeze programme. A tragic, needless death, but as you
can see, Voyager was not responsible. After Tedran was killed, Voyager
was attacked by nine Kyrian ships. My programme was disabled, most
likely when they stole my backup module. The next thing I knew, I was
standing next to this gentleman seven centuries later. <br>
KYRIAN ARBITER: Very entertaining. <br>
EMH: I'll admit your holotechnology is new to me. I had to extrapolate in a few
places. But I assure you this is an accurate recreation. <br>
KYRIAN ARBITER: Perhaps. Or perhaps it's the fabrication of a war
criminal who's afraid for his life. <br>
VASKAN ARBITER: Do you have any evidence to support your explanation? <br>
EMH: In fact, I do. I've confirmed that this is the same tricorder I
used to scan Tedran at the moment of his death. If I can access the
bio-readings inside, I can prove he was killed by a Vaskan weapon, not
by Captain Janeway. <br>
VASKAN ARBITER: Can this be done? <br>
QUARREN: I've been trying to decipher the instrument for years, but,
with the Doctor's help<br>
KYRIAN ARBITER: I fail to see what this would prove. Tedran died on
Voyager, a victim of a conspiracy to oppress my people. The weapon
used, who fired it, this is all beside the point. <br>
VASKAN ARBITER: Was there a conspiracy? Did Voyager really help my
ancestors to start the Great War? Or were Kyrians the aggressors as my
people have always believed? Now, this casts doubt on everything. <br>
KYRIAN ARBITER: But it doesn't change the fact my children can't attend
the same academies as yours, or that we are forced to live outside of
the city centre. <br>
VASKAN ARBITER: Today's problems are not at issue here. This is about
history. <br>
EMH: Look, I don't know who started your war. All I'm saying is that
Voyager wasn't responsible. <br>
KYRIAN ARBITER: I can't believe that you would cooperate with this
murderer. You of all people. You built this museum. <br>
QUARREN: The facts are turning out to be more complex than I expected. <br>
KYRIAN ARBITER: We shouldn't be listening to this hologram. I want him
arrested and charged for the crimes we know he committed. <br>
VASKAN ARBITER: That's not your decision to make. <br>
KYRIAN ARBITER: No, it's not, is it? I'm only on this commission
because you needed a token Kyrian. <br>
QUARREN: Please. This isn't about race. <br>
KYRIAN ARBITER: It's always about race. You seize every opportunity to
keep yourselves in power. <br>
VASKAN ARBITER: I'm sorry you see it that way. I think we are obligated
to hear what the Doctor has to say. Proceed with your investigation. <br>
QUARREN: Yes, Arbiter. <br>
KYRIAN ARBITER: You'll pay for your crimes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
Seven hundred years and I'm still caught in the middle of your little
dispute. One might have hoped for a bit of social progress in the
interim. <br>
QUARREN: Change never comes easily for us. <br>
EMH: Hmm. That's an understatement. <br>
QUARREN: I've entered the specifications that you gave me. <br>
EMH: Let's give it a try. (A tool materialises.) Hmm. Close enough. This diagnostic tool should
help me get past the initial encryption sequences. Too bad we can't
re-create B'Elanna Torres. <br>
QUARREN: Torres. The chief transporter operator. <br>
EMH: Chief Engineer. You might want to make the correction in your
history books. <br>
QUARREN: What was she like, Torres? I suppose we've gotten her
personality wrong too. <br>
EMH: Starting to believe me, are you? <br>
QUARREN: Well, let's just say I'm trying to keep an open mind. <br>
EMH: B'Elanna Torres. Intelligent, beautiful and with a chip on her
shoulder the size of the Horsehead Nebula. She also had a kind of
vulnerability that made her quite endearing. <br>
QUARREN: You miss her, and the others. <br>
EMH: From my perspective, I saw them all only a few days ago. But in
fact, it's been centuries, and I'll never see them again. Did they ever
reach home? I wonder. <br>
QUARREN: I've always wondered that too, from as far back as I can
remember. <br>
EMH: Really? <br>
QUARREN: Ever since I was a small child, the first time I heard the
name Voyager, it conjured up my imagination. <br>
EMH: Even though we were the bad guys? <br>
QUARREN: That didn't matter. I was too young to understand the
implications. The fact you were so far from home, travelling across the
stars. Ah, I found it all very heroic. I suppose Voyager is what made
me fall in love with history. <br>
EMH: If it means anything to you, you would have made a fine member of
our crew. <br>(Boom! The building shakes.)<br>EMH: I hope that's part of the simulation. <br>
QUARREN: No, it isn't.<br>(The sound of breaking glass, and loud voices.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Museum]</b>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(A group of young Vaskans are trashing the museum.)<br>MOB: Everything goes! The days of lies are over! Destroy it all!<br>QUARREN: No! Stop this! <br>
VASKAN VISITOR: We know about the hologram. This museum's filled with
lies. <br>
QUARREN: Stop! Listen to me! <br>
VASKAN VISITOR: We've listened long enough! <br>
QUARREN: They're using photon grenades. We've got to take cover. This
way. <br>(The
tricorder gets left behind on a step as they take shelter by a large
buttress. In the cold light of day, the mob has gone, but there is
still weapons fire outside.)&nbsp;<br>EMH:
What's happening? I've been hearing weapons. <br>
QUARREN: It's getting worse. Protests, vandalism. Two people have been
killed. Don't worry, they've cordoned off the museum. We're safe for
now. <br>
EMH: That's not what I'm concerned about. Two deaths, a race riot, all
because of me? <br>
QUARREN: You were only the catalyst. The pressure's been building for
years. It was only a matter of time before something set it off. Have
you found the tricorder? <br>
EMH: Not yet. <br>
QUARREN: It's crucial that we do. The Kyrians are demanding you be
punished for your crimes, but the Vaskans want to hear your version of
events again. They want to continue the investigation. <br>
EMH: What's going to happen? <br>
QUARREN: I don't know. The Vaskans are more powerful, but the Kyrians
are very angry. They're talking about another war. <br>
EMH: Then there's only one solution. Delete my programme. I've become a
kind of symbol for this conflict. As long as I'm around your people are
going to keep on fighting. I'll show you how to decompile my programme.
You can say I was damaged in the attack last night. No one will hold
you responsible. <br>
QUARREN: I can't do that to you. <br>
EMH: Then I'll do it myself. <br>
QUARREN: No! <br>
EMH: I'm a medical hologram, programmed to do no harm. But I'm doing
harm on a global scale. Ever since you reactivated me, I've been
concerned with clearing Voyager's good name. But that's not important
now. There's more at stake. <br>
QUARREN: A few days ago I might have agreed with you, but what about
the facts? <br>
EMH: Facts be damned! Names, dates, places, it's all open to
interpretation. Who's to say what really happened? And ultimately, what
difference does it make? What matters is today and the future of your
people. <br>
QUARREN: Doctor, you were there. You can't deny what happened. <br>
EMH: I can, and I will. Tedran was a martyr for your people, a hero. A
symbol of your struggle for freedom. Who am I to wander in seven
hundred years later and take that away from you? <br>
QUARREN: History has been abused. We keep blaming each other for what
happened in the past. If you don't help us now, it could be another
seven hundred years. <br>
EMH: Let's find that tricorder.<br>(The camera swings round to reveal that all this too was a simulation.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TABRIS:
It was a pivotal moment in our history. As a result of the Doctor's
testimony, a dialogue was opened between our peoples. Eventually, we
found a new respect for our divergent cultures and traditions. The
efforts of people like Quarren and the Doctor paved the way for unity.
Quarren died six years later, but he lived long enough to witness the
Dawn of Harmony. <br>
KYRIAN SPECTATOR: And the Doctor? <br>
TABRIS: Well, he served as our surgical chancellor for many years until
he decided to leave. He took a small craft and set a course for the
Alpha Quadrant, attempting to trace the path of Voyager. He said he had
a longing for home. This way. </font> </p>
