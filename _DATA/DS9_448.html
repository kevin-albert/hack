<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SISKO: Our mission is to take the Defiant into the
Gamma Quadrant and try to find the leaders of the Dominion, the
Founders. <br>
KIRA: What the hell is wrong with Starfleet? How could they do this to
him? <br>
SISKO: This has been a long time coming, Major. Starfleet has never
been happy with the Constable. I want him to stay as much as you do but
he has to want to stay. <br>
ODO: Ever since we've come into the Gamma Quadrant, I've had this
feeling of being drawn somewhere, to a specific place. The Omarion
Nebula. <br>
(Three Jem'Hadar against one Defiant, they get boarded and beaten.) <br>
ODO: The last time I saw the Defiant, she was dead in space and
surrounded by Jem'Hadar ships. <br>
KIRA: Sisko? Bashir? <br>
ODO: I don't know. <br>

FEMALE: Yes. <br>
ODO: And you're saying this is where I'm from? <br>
FEMALE: This is your home. <br>
ODO: I wish I could remember it. <br>
FEMALE: It's understandable that you cannot. You were still newly
formed when you left us. <br>
ODO: Newly formed? You mean I was an infant? <br>
FEMALE: An infant, yes. <br>
ODO: I suspected as much. Tell me, do I have any family at all? <br>
FEMALE: Of course. <br>
ODO: I'd like to meet them, if that's possible. <br>
FEMALE: You already have. We are all part of the Great Link. <br>
ODO: Is that all of us, or are there others? <br>
KIRA: Odo, this isn't a police investigation. <br>
ODO: I'm aware of that, Major. <br>
KIRA: Then stop interrogating these people. This is the moment you've
been waiting for all your life. Enjoy it. He really is happy to be
here. Aren't you? <br>
ODO: Yes, of course. It's just this is all very sudden. <br>
FEMALE: And you have many questions. <br>
ODO: Yes. Please, what exactly is this Great Link? <br>
FEMALE: The Link is the very foundation of our society. It provides a
meaning to our existence. It is the merging of thought and form, the
sharing of idea and sensation. Is something wrong? <br>
ODO: I've lived a very solitary life. <br>
FEMALE: That's unfortunate but necessary, as you'll learn in time. But
now, that part of your life is over. You're home. <br>
(She holds out her hand to Odo.) <br>
MALE: What are you doing? <br>
FEMALE: Take it. <br>
MALE: It's not time. He isn't ready. <br>
FEMALE: He's been gone too long. He needs to remember, if only for a
moment. Don't be afraid. <br>
(Odo takes her hand and their limbs blend for a short while before
reforming again. Odo appears overwhelmed.) <br>
KIRA: Odo. What have you done to him? <br>
FEMALE: I allowed him to experience the Link. <br>
KIRA: Odo. <br>
ODO: Yes, Major. <br>
KIRA: Are you all right? What happened? <br>
ODO: I'm not sure. But I know one thing. She's right, I am home.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Commander's log, supplemental. It's been six
days since we had to abandon the Defiant after the Jem'Hadar attack. We
still don't know what happened to the rest of the crew. Doctor Bashir
and I have plotted a course back to the wormhole. Whether the shuttle
can get us back there or not is questionable at best. Our engines are
failing, our external sensors are barely functioning and life support
systems are at twenty percent and dropping. <br>
BASHIR: But other than that we couldn't be in better shape. <br>
SISKO: I thought you were sleeping. <br>
BASHIR: From the sound of things I wish I were. <br>
SISKO: Things could be worse. <br>
(They're pulled to a halt) <br>
BASHIR: I believe you. You think it's some kind of tractor beam? <br>
SISKO: Could be. I wish these sensors were working. <br>
(Clang and the rear hatch starts to open. Bashir levels a phaser at
it.) <br>
BASHIR: Now what? <br>
O'BRIEN: Whoa. Hey, don't shoot. We surrender. <br>
SISKO: Chief. Dax. <br>
BASHIR: I don't believe it. We thought you'd been captured by the
Jem'Hadar. <br>
DAX: Well, we had our doubts about ever seeing you again either,
Julian. <br>
O'BRIEN: We've been searching for you for days. <br>
SISKO: What about the others? <br>
DAX: No sign of them yet, but we still have ships out looking for them.
<br>
O'BRIEN: Meanwhile, our orders are to get you back to DS Nine as soon
as possible. <br>
DAX: There are big things happening there, Benjamin. I think you're in
for a surprise.

KIRA: This is beautiful. <br>
ODO: How long do they plan on making us wait here? <br>
KIRA: It's only been a few hours. <br>
ODO: I finally return home and they still treat me like an outsider. <br>
KIRA: Believe me, you're not the outsider here. I am. <br>
ODO: You? <br>
KIRA I'm the one they don't trust, not you. <br>
FEMALE: How perceptive, Major. If our history has taught us anything,
it's to avoid contact with Solids whenever possible. <br>
KIRA: Solids? <br>
FEMALE: Our name for mono-forms like yourself, who'll never know the
joys of the Great Link. <br>
KIRA: I don't intend to stay long. There's a chance Sisko and the
others survived the attack. I'm going to go back to the shuttle and try
contacting them. <br>
FEMALE: I'm sorry. I cannot allow you to send any communications from
the planet's surface. They could be traced back here. We value our
isolation. <br>
ODO: Yes, of course. <br>
FEMALE: Tell me, Odo, have you made good use of the arboretum? <br>
ODO: In what way? <br>
FEMALE: By assuming the various shapes surrounding you. <br>
ODO: Why would I do that? <br>
FEMALE: To become a thing is to know a thing. To assume its form is to
begin to understand its existence. <br>
ODO: Understand it? How? <br>
FEMALE: Living among the Solids has damaged you far worse than I
realised. It has left you ignorant of the gifts you possess. <br>
ODO: Then teach me what I need to know. <br>
FEMALE: I'll do what I can. But in the end, this is another journey
you'll have to make on your own. <br>
(She hands him a rock.) <br>
FEMALE: And when it is over you'll be ready to take your place in the
Great Link. <br>
(She leaves.) <br>
KIRA: Odo. <br>
ODO: I'd like to be alone if you don't mind. <br>
KIRA: All right. But if you need me, I'll be in the shuttle trying to
contact Sisko. Don't worry. When I was in the resistance I learned to
camouflage subspace messages with quantum interference. I taught the
method to Commander Sisko. If anyone intercepts the signal all they'll
read is elevated levels of background radiation. <br>
ODO: Good luck. <br>
KIRA: You too.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NECHAYEV: Well, Commander, it appears your mission
was an even greater success than we hoped. <br>
SISKO: So I'm told. Has the delegation from the Founders arrived on the
station yet? <br>
NECHAYEV: They're already meeting with representatives from the
Federation Council and a dozen other Alpha Quadrant alliances. We're
hoping to have a treaty signed within a matter of days, and we have you
to thank for it. <br>
SISKO: Actually it's Lieutenant Dax and Chief O'Brien who deserve most
of the credit. <br>
O'BRIEN: We were lucky the Jem'Hadar handed us over to the Founders. <br>
DAX: We just had to convince them that we were serious about peace. <br>
O'BRIEN: Actually, it didn't take that much convincing. <br>
SISKO: I suppose the only question is, can we trust them? <br>
NECHAYEV: It's a risk, I know, but both the Federation Council and
Starfleet Command believe it's one worth taking. By the way, Commander,
one of the Founders asked to see you the moment you arrived on the
station. <br>
SISKO: Asked to see me? <br>
NECHAYEV: If you're not too busy. <br>
SISKO: Well, I suppose I could spare a few minutes. </font></p>

forward to meeting you. I am Borath. <br>
SISKO: And you're one of the Founders? <br>
BORATH: That's correct. You seem surprised. <br>
SISKO: Not really. Only I hadn't realised till now I've already met one
of your people. <br>
BORATH: You're referring to Eris, of course. Yes, she is one of us.
Though she couldn't very well admit it while you were pointing a phaser
at her. I'm glad to see you're not holding one now. <br>
SISKO: Do I need one? <br>
BORATH: Not at all. You seem sceptical. <br>
SISKO: Can you blame me? <br>
BORATH: No. I realise you have no reason to trust the Dominion, but you
must understand that we were only trying to defend ourselves. <br>
SISKO: From what? <br>
BORATH: We felt threatened by your incursions into the Gamma Quadrant. <br>
SISKO: And now? <br>
BORATH: Commander, you risked your life to bring us a message of peace
and friendship. We chose to accept your offer. Would you rather we
refused? <br>
SISKO: No. <br>
BORATH: Good. Because believe me, Commander, an alliance between the
Dominion and the Federation will be beneficial to both our people.

BASHIR: Why thank you, Garak. It's good to be back. <br>

BASHIR: Business keeping you busy? <br>
GARAK: The tailoring business, or the spy business? I'm joking, of
course. <br>
BASHIR: Of course. <br>
GARAK: I've missed you. I've been genuinely concerned for your safety.
Lunch hasn't been the same without you. <br>
BASHIR: That's very kind of you to say so, Garak. Hopefully things'll
start getting back to normal around here. <br>
GARAK: Oh, I doubt that's going to happen, Doctor. I doubt that very
much. <br>
BASHIR: And why is that? <br>
GARAK: There's an old saying on Cardassia. Enemies make dangerous
friends. And I fear the Dominion will make a very dangerous friend
indeed. <br>
BASHIR: I take it you're referring to the peace talks. <br>
GARAK: Exactly. I'm afraid these treaty negotiations are a mistake
we're going to live to regret. <br>
BASHIR: Is that your opinion or the opinion of the Cardassian Central
Command? <br>
GARAK: The former, I assure you. The Central Command is very much in
favour of this treaty. Which, as far as I'm concerned, only justifies
my fears. <br>

nothing. <br>
(T'Rul leaves the infirmary with a bandaged hand) <br>
BASHIR: Sub-Commander T'Rul, are you all right? <br>
T'RUL: I'm fine. I had a minor disagreement with some Starfleet
security officers. They refused to allow me to speak with the
Federation's negotiating team. <br>
BASHIR: What did you want to talk to them about? <br>
T'RUL: I wanted to protest the exclusion of the Romulan Empire from the
treaty negotiations. <br>
BASHIR: I wasn't aware the Romulans had been excluded. <br>
T'RUL: Every great power in the Alpha Quadrant has been invited to
participate except for us. <br>
BASHIR: There must be some mistake. <br>
T'RUL: The mistake is thinking the Romulan empire will stand by and
allow such a betrayal to go unchallenged. Believe me, Doctor, if a
treaty is signed without our approval, it will mean war. <br>

more of an idea what it is to be a rock than I did before. <br>

SISKO: I was wondering what prompted that decision. <br>
NECHAYEV: The Founders requested that they be excluded. <br>
SISKO: Did they say why? <br>
NECHAYEV: They felt the Romulans would be a disruptive influence. <br>
SISKO: More disruptive than the Cardassians? <br>
NECHAYEV: They seemed to think so. Do you have a problem with this,
Commander? <br>
SISKO: Whether I have a problem with it isn't the point. It's the
Romulans we have to worry about. <br>
NECHAYEV: Commander, if this treaty is signed, and I'm confident it
will be, we'll never have to worry about the Romulans again. <br>
SISKO: Are you sure of that? <br>

insult, but in defiance we took it and made it our own. <br>
ODO: Go on, please. <br>
FEMALE: The Great Link tells us that many years ago our people roamed
the stars, searching out other races so we could add to our knowledge
of the galaxy. We went in peace, but too often we were met with
suspicion, hatred and violence. <br>
ODO: Why? <br>
FEMALE: The Solids feared our metamorphic abilities, so we were beaten,
hunted and killed. Finally we arrived here. And here, safe in our
isolation, we made our home. <br>
ODO: Tell me, why was I sent away? <br>
FEMALE: Because even in our solitude we desired to learn more about the
galaxy. You were one of a hundred infants we sent off to gain that
knowledge for us. <br>
ODO: But how could you be sure that we'd find our way back here? <br>
FEMALE: You had no choice. The urge to return home was implanted in
your genetic makeup. And now, thanks to the passageway, you're the
first to return to us. We weren't expecting you so soon. <br>

SISKO: And you're telling me the Bajorans have agreed to this? <br>
BORATH: We're confident they'll have no objections. <br>
SISKO: And if they do object, what then? You send in the Jem'Hadar? <br>
BORATH: The Jem'Hadar are used only against our enemies. Bajor will be
protected, Commander. We'll see to it. <br>
SISKO: What about the wormhole? Will they get to protect that too? <br>
NECHAYEV: It's the price of peace, Benjamin. <br>
SISKO: Well, if you ask me, the price is too damned high. What is the
Federation supposed to get out of all this? <br>
BORATH: Our friendship. Isn't that enough? <br>
NECHAYEV: And you, Benjamin, get a promotion. Captain Sisko. It's an
important step toward that Admiralcy you've always wanted. <br>
SISKO: I want a chance to speak to the Federation negotiating team
before this treaty is signed. <br>
NECHAYEV: It's too late for that, Ben. The treaty was signed late this
afternoon. <br>
BORATH: It's the beginning of a new era, Commander, and you helped make
it possible. Congratulations.

KIRA: Odo, I've been waiting for you. <br>
ODO: Major, I have just had the most remarkable experience. For a few
moments I actually felt what it was like to be an Arbazon Vulture. The
air currents beneath my wings, the exhilaration of soaring above the
treetops. Oh, it was all very stimulating. <br>
KIRA: I'm so happy for you. <br>
ODO: I know you are. <br>
KIRA: So, I guess this means you'll be staying here a while. <br>
ODO: I've enjoyed working with you, Major. <br>
KIRA: I've enjoyed working with you too, Odo. But before we say
goodbye, I need your help one last time. <br>
ODO: Certainly. <br>
KIRA: Remember that power source I was telling you about? <br>
ODO: The one preventing you from trying to contact Commander Sisko. <br>
KIRA: Well, I've found it. <br>
ODO: And what did it turn out to be? <br>
KIRA: I couldn't tell. There was a door blocking my path. I need you to
help me open it. <br>
ODO: What kind of door? <br>
KIRA: It's composed of some kind of metal the tricorder couldn't
identify. Other than that, it's an ordinary door. <br>
ODO: That's odd. My people have no need for doors. They dislike taking
humanoid form. <br>

before you left. I just wanted to tell you how impressed I've been with
you during these past two years. You've run this station with strength,
dignity and compassion. Well done. <br>
SISKO: Thank you, Mister Garak. <br>
GARAK: But I'm sure you'll be back before long. Though from what I've
heard, it'll be to fight against Bajor. <br>
SISKO: I've heard the same rumours. That Bajor has forged a pact with
the Romulans to stand against the Jem'Hadar and their allies. <br>
GARAK: The Bajorans have fought for their freedom before. It only makes
sense that they'd fight for it again. <br>
SISKO: So much for my peace mission. <br>
GARAK: Do I detect a note of bitterness in your voice? <br>
SISKO: I wouldn't be surprised. <br>
GARAK: If it means anything to you, Commander, I happen to share your
feelings about this Dominion treaty. I've thought about it a great
deal, and the only explanation I can find is that our leaders have
simply gone insane. <br>
SISKO: It seems that way. <br>
GARAK: Unfortunately, there's nothing you or I can do about it. <br>
SISKO: I suppose not. <br>
GARAK: After all, you have your orders and as for me, well, I wouldn't
dream of opposing the wishes of the Central Command. A pity. <br>
SISKO: I agree that it's a pity. <br>

GARAK: Not at all, Doctor, but after years of hemming dresses, a little
action is a welcome change of pace. <br>
SISKO: I hope you feel the same way an hour from now. The first thing
we need to do is get our hands on a runabout. <br>
DAX: It's already taken care of, Benjamin. The Chief's waiting for us
at landing pad C with the Rio Grande and a full complement of photon
torpedoes. <br>
SISKO: How did you know we needed photon torpedoes? <br>
DAX: I know you. You want to make sure the Dominion stays on their side
of the galaxy, and the only way to do that is to collapse the entrance
to the wormhole. <br>
SISKO: I'm glad we're all in agreement. <br>
BASHIR: Well, I guess this means the end of our Starfleet careers. <br>
GARAK: Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, Doctor. <br>
DAX: That's easy for you to say. <br>

little foolish to worry about your careers at a time like this, when
there's a good chance we're all about to be killed. </font></p>

BORATH: Nothing harmful. We're just conducting a little experiment. <br>
KIRA: What kind of experiment? <br>
BORATH: To see how they'd respond to an attempt by the Dominion to gain
a foothold into the Alpha Quadrant. We were curious to see how much
they'd be willing to sacrifice to avoid a war. <br>
KIRA: And what have you found out? <br>
BORATH: Unfortunately, they're proving to be just as stubborn as I'd
feared. <br>
ODO: I'm glad to hear it. <br>
BORATH: You are? Well, that is a problem. But thankfully, it's not one
I have to solve. <br>
FEMALE: But I do. <br>
ODO: I don't understand. You knew about this? <br>
FEMALE: Yes. <br>
ODO: But how could you allow it? <br>
KIRA: You belong to the Dominion, don't you? <br>
FEMALE: Belong to it? Major, the Changelings are the Dominion. <br>
ODO: You're the Founders. <br>
FEMALE: Ironic, isn't it? The hunted now control the destinies of
hundreds of other races. <br>
ODO: But why control anyone? <br>
FEMALE: Because what you control can't hurt you. So, many years ago we
set ourselves the task of imposing order on a chaotic universe. <br>
KIRA: Is that what you call it? Imposing order? I call it murder. <br>
FEMALE: What you call it is no concern of ours. <br>
ODO: How do you justify the deaths of so many people? <br>
FEMALE: The Solids have always been a threat to us. That's the only the
justification we need. <br>
ODO: But these Solids have never harmed you. They travel the galaxy in
order to expand their knowledge, just as you once did. <br>
FEMALE: The Solids are nothing like us. <br>
ODO: No, I suppose they're not. And neither am I. I've devoted my life
to the pursuit of justice, but justice means nothing to you, does it? <br>
FEMALE: It's not justice you desire, Odo, but order. The same as we do.
And we can help you satisfy that desire in ways the Solids never could.
This will all become clear to you once you've taken your place in the
Great Link. <br>
ODO: No. I admit this Link of yours is appealing. But you see, I
already have a link with these people. I want you to remove those
devices and bring them their comm. badges. <br>
BORATH: We can't allow them to leave. <br>
ODO: And I can't allow you to keep them here. They're leaving, and so
am I. <br>

really willing to leave it again so soon? <br>

T'RUL: The last thing I remember is being shot by some Jem'Hadar
soldier. <br>
KIRA: I'm sure it all seemed very real, but the truth is, you've been
held in this room since the Jem'Hadar brought you here from the
Defiant. <br>

BORATH: Your ship is in orbit. You may transport back to it whenever
you're ready. <br>
