KIM: I'm not sure. The transmission just stopped. <br>
JANEWAY: Locate the source. See if you can get it back. <br>
KIM: It looks like. Captain, the transmission was sent along the same
network of alien relay stations we used to send the Doctor to the Alpha
Quadrant. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Starfleet Command must be using them just like we did. <br>
JANEWAY: Harry, can you clear the interference from that message? <br>
KIM: Yes ma'am. <br>

home. <br>
TUVOK: Nonetheless, we can't assume they've been able to devise a plan
this quickly. <br>

most of the interference. Here it is. <br>

two seven four mark one three. <br>

Maybe they've figured out a way to get us home. <br>
PARIS: How can they get us home from sixty thousand light years away? <br>
KIM: Who knows what technological advances Starfleet has come up with
since we've been gone. They might have developed a whole new way of
travelling through space. <br>
TUVOK: Since it was technology that brought us to the Delta Quadrant in
the first place, it's a reasonable assumption. Technology could bring
us back again. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Starfleet found a stable wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant.
Maybe they've discovered one that leads here. <br>
JANEWAY: This kind of speculation can be intriguing, but be careful
about setting yourselves up to be disappointed. <br>
KIM: I'm just happy my folks know I'm alive. <br>
JANEWAY: I imagine there were quite a few celebrations when people got
the news. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Probably. But I can see where it might make things more
difficult for some. I'd guess a lot of people had given up on us, done
their mourning, gone on with their lives, found some kind of
resolution. Now they get word that we're alive, but so far away that we
might as well be dead. <br>
KIM: Some people might feel that way, but not my mom and dad. <br>
JANEWAY: At the very least, we know the relay stations extend almost
all the way to the Alpha Quadrant. If Starfleet has found a way to use
them to transmit messages, we'll be able to stay in constant contact
with people at home. That has to be comforting. <br>
KIM: I'm sure it is, but I think it's more comforting to think that
Starfleet is going to get us home. If no one objects, that's what I'm
going to do. </font></p>

You were supposed to report to Sickbay this morning for your weekly
check-up. Where have you been? <br>
SEVEN: Here, doing my job. <br>
EMH: And just what is this pressing task? <br>
SEVEN: I'm trying to retrieve more of the message transmitted from
Starfleet Command. <br>
EMH: Your devotion to duty is admirable, but you must remember that your
implants have to be monitored regularly. <br>
SEVEN: I'm fine. <br>
EMH: No, you're not. I'm detecting reduced levels of erythrocytes in
your blood. How long has it been since you regenerated? <br>
SEVEN: Fifty eight hours <br>
EMH: Well, that explains it. We've discussed this before, Seven. You
must regenerate in your alcove for at least three hours a day. <br>
SEVEN: I have gone as long as two hundred hours without regenerating <br>
EMH: That was when you were a Borg. You seem to forget you're a good
deal more human now. <br>
SEVEN: I assure you, I have not forgotten. Another one. <br>
EMH: I beg your pardon? <br>
SEVEN: I have retrieved another word of text. That makes six. <br>
EMH: Six words in fifty eight hours? Wouldn't it be more efficient just
to wait until we arrive at the relay station? <br>
SEVEN: This message is important to the captain <br>
EMH: I'm aware of that. In fact, if it weren't for me, this
transmission wouldn't have been possible in the first place. I was the
one who risked my matrix in order to go to the Alpha Quadrant. If we
ever get home, I expect I'll become quite the hero. Emergency Medical
Hologram instrumental in the return of Voyager crew. Has a nice ring to
it, don't you think? <br>
SEVEN: On the other hand, it is entirely possible that your programme
will be deleted and you'll be upgraded to conform to the most recent
standards. <br>
EMH: Unlikely. I've accomplished things no EMH ever has. In fact, most
likely I'll become an object of intense study and discussion. Possibly
even veneration. What's that?<br>(Voyager is shaking.) </font></p>

JANEWAY: Report. <br>
KIM: We're encountering some kind of gravimetric forces. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Source? <br>
KIM: Looks like it's coming from the relay station we're heading for. <br>
JANEWAY: That station is still two light years away. How could it
project a gravimetric field this far? <br>
CHAKOTAY: It would have to have an incredibly powerful energy source. <br>
KIM: I've compensated for the disturbance. We should be all right. At
least until we get closer. <br>
TUVOK: I'm detecting a ship, Captain. Eight hundred thousand kilometres
off the port bow. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. <br>
TUVOK: It's adrift, no propulsion systems, no weapons, no life support.
<br>
KIM: I'm picking up one male humanoid aboard. He's dead. <br>
JANEWAY: As soon as we're close enough, beam the body to Sickbay. I
want to know how he died. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(A sack of skin is on the biobed.)<br>JANEWAY: What's happened to him? <br>
EMH: He appears to have suffered a complete osteotomy. He's been
gutted. Apparently some kind of surgical procedure was used to remove
the entire skeleton, as well as the musculature, the ligaments and
tendons, and the internal organs. <br>
JANEWAY: How long ago did this happen? <br>
EMH: It's difficult to say. Somewhere between a week and a month. <br>
SEVEN: I've seen this before. The Borg encountered a small ship of
species five one seven four. They were also destroyed in this fashion. <br>
EMH: Did you ever determine who did it, and why? <br>
SEVEN: No. It was irrelevant. <br>
JANEWAY: Return the body to his ship. His people may be able to
retrieve him. <br>
EMH: Very well. <br>

processors in Astrometrics to download the message. <br>

TUVOK: The gravimetric field. <br>
KIM: Commander, if my sensors are right, that station is using a
quantum singularity as a power source. <br>
PARIS: A black hole? <br>
KIM: It's a tiny one, probably about a centimetre in diameter, but it's
putting out almost four terawatts of energy. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That someone's managed to contain a singularity and construct a
space station around it and tap it's power. That's fascinating. <br>
PARIS: Can we take the ship any closer? <br>
KIM: I wouldn't recommend it. Voyager would take a beating from the
gravimetric eddies.<br>

JANEWAY: We'll see if we can download the message from here. <br>
SEVEN: The datastream degraded during transmission. Elements have been
dislocated, rearranged. It's going to require some time to decompress
the message and rearrange it in the proper sequence. <br>
JANEWAY: Don't worry about the sequence. Get it out in bits and pieces
if you have to. We can put it together later. <br>
SEVEN: I've accessed a block of data. I'm downloading the text. <br>
JANEWAY: How much we miss you. We talk about you often. Wondering about
your day. Sounds awfully personal from Starfleet Command. The children
have grown so much you wouldn't. These are letters. These are letters
from home. <br>(Later, Janeway hands some PADDs to Neelix.)<br>
JANEWAY: You'll be the official mail carrier, Neelix. We'll get you the
letters as quickly as we can download them.<br>
NEELIX: A task I'm happy to perform, Captain. I can tell you, I've never
seen the crew this excited. <br>
JANEWAY: This is the closest they've come to their families in almost
four years. <br>
NEELIX: I promise to treat these like gemstones. <br>
JANEWAY: By the time you've delivered them, we should have more. <br>
SEVEN: Captain. I've discovered something odd. There seems to be more
here than just letters. <br>
JANEWAY: What do you mean? <br>
SEVEN: There's a latent datastream buried under the message. It's
heavily encrypted. <br>
JANEWAY: Encrypted? <br>
SEVEN: It appears to contain a large block of text and what may be maps
<br>
JANEWAY: Can you retrieve any of it? <br>
SEVEN: Not immediately. When more of the letters have been cleared out,
I should be able to access the coded message. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, I might just hope that it contains a plan for bringing
us back to the Alpha Quadrant. I'm curious, Seven. What do you think
about all this? Messages, the possibility of getting home? <br>
SEVEN: It lacks any emotional resonance for me. I've never even been to
Earth. <br>
JANEWAY: You realise you may have family there? <br>
SEVEN: That had not occurred to me. <br>
JANEWAY: You could have cousins, grandparents. There might be more
emotional resonance than you think. </font></p>

NEELIX: You're going to wait until you finish the tactical review? <br>
TUVOK: Do you have any reason to believe the content of the message
will change during that time? <br>
NEELIX: That's not the point. It's a letter from your family. Don't you
want to know what it says? <br>
TUVOK: I fully intend to find out what it says. <br>
NEELIX: It has some important news. <br>
TUVOK: You mean you've read it? <br>

addressed to, I, I couldn't help it. Would you like me to read it to
you? <br>
TUVOK: Very well. <br>
NEELIX: My husband, we have been given the news that you are alive.
Your children and I have asked the priests at the temple of Aymonk to
say prayers for your safe return. That's very sweet. <br>
TUVOK: Amonak. <br>
NEELIX: Pardon? <br>
TUVOK: The temple of Amonak. One of the most sacred on Vulcan. <br>
NEELIX: Amonak. Of course. The most significant news is the fact that
your first son, Sek, has gone through the Pon Farr. He mated and has
become a father. You are now the grandfather of a healthy female who
they have named T'Meni, after your mother. You're a grandfather. Isn't
that wonderful? Congratulations. What should we call you now? Grandpa?
Gramps? <br>
TUVOK: I think Commander Tuvok will suffice. Thank you, Mister Neelix.
I'll read the rest to myself. <br>
NEELIX: Just so long as you read it right away. No procrastinating. Who
knows what else might be in that letter?<br>(Neelix

Commander, am I correct in assuming that Vulcans are incapable of
lying? <br>
TUVOK: We are capable of telling lies. However, I have never found it
prudent or necessary to do so. <br>
SEVEN: You have never lied? <br>
TUVOK: Only under orders from a superior officer. <br>
SEVEN: Then I must ask you something. Is it the captain's custom to
send at least two people on an away mission? <br>
TUVOK: It's not only her custom, it's recommended Starfleet protocol. <br>
SEVEN: I see. <br>
TUVOK: Is there a purpose to your question? <br>
SEVEN: I am wondering if the captain still doesn't trust me. If she
feels I require supervision. <br>
TUVOK: I am not certain how the captain regards you, but her decision
to have me accompany you on this mission shouldn't be taken as evidence
of any particular attitude. <br>
SEVEN: I believe we are close enough to emit a polaron pulse. <br>
TUVOK: Bring the main deflector online. <br>
SEVEN: Ready. <br>
TUVOK: The variance in the containment field is now at point two nine. <br>
SEVEN: That should prevent further degradation of the signal. <br>
TUVOK: Let me ask you a question, Seven. Is the captain's opinion
important to you? <br>
SEVEN: My understanding of the hierarchy on Voyager is that the captain's opinion is important to every member of the crew. <br>(Whumph!)<br>SEVEN: What's
happened? <br>
TUVOK: We have just been scanned by a sub-neucleonic beam of some kind.
<br>
SEVEN: The navigational sensors have been disrupted. <br>
TUVOK: We must get Voyager to send out a directional beacon to guide us
back. Tuvok to Voyager. Voyager, please respond. <br>
SEVEN: Commander, we've lost other systems as well. We have no
communications, no warp engines and no weapons. <br>
TUVOK: I suspect this was done intentionally by the ship that's
approaching rapidly off out port stern. <br>(It is Hirogen, and they start firing.)<br>
SEVEN: They're at fifty thousand kilometres and closing. <br>
TUVOK: Our shields are losing integrity. <br>
SEVEN: I'll try to get at least one phaser array back online.
Commander, one more hit and we'll be susceptible to a hull breach. <br>
TUVOK: That ship is larger than ours. If we lure it closer to the
station, it will be far more vulnerable to the gravitational eddies than
we are. A tractor beam. We are being pulled toward the ship. <br>

PARIS: I'll be on the bridge. <br>
TORRES: What, you're not going to wait? <br>
PARIS: I'm on duty. <br>
TORRES: Voyager is hanging in space. There's not a lot to do at the
helm. <br>
PARIS: I just thought that I should be at my post. <br>
TORRES: You may be able to fool someone else with that ploy, but you're
talking to me, Tom. <br>
PARIS: Just download the letter, okay? <br>
TORRES: A little more has come in. It's from Starfleet. From an Admiral
Owen. Do you know him? <br>
PARIS: Admiral Owen Paris. It's my father. <br>
TORRES: That's wonderful. <br>
PARIS: Yeah. Maybe. I don't know exactly why, but the more everybody
gets excited about these letters from home, the more I don't want any
part of it. Maybe because what I have on Voyager is so much better than
anything I ever had back there. I just don't want the reminder. <br>
TORRES: You're not the same person you were four years ago. What makes
you think he is? <br>
PARIS: No, you don't know him. <br>
TORRES: At least give him a chance. He's obviously reaching out. <br>
PARIS: When he forms an opinion about something, nothing can change his
mind. <br>
TORRES: Fine. Excuse me if I can't feel terribly sorry for you. I
learned this morning that a lot of my friends are dead. And I've gone
from being so angry that I wanted to kill someone to crying for an
hour. And now I'm just trying to, to accept it and move on. <br>
PARIS: B'Elanna, that's awful. I am so sorry. And here I am going on
about something that doesn't even matter anymore. <br>(Paris hugs Torres.)<br>
TORRES: No, I'm sorry. It obviously does. You care what he thinks about
you. <br>
PARIS: Yeah. Yeah, I guess I still do. <br>
TORRES: I'll let you know when I get the whole letter. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Come in. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Looks like Tuvok and Seven pulled it off. The containment
field has stabilised quite a bit. B'Elanna says she'd downloading the
letters much more easily now. <br>
JANEWAY: That's good news. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We don't have the shuttle on sensors yet, but they should be
back soon. <br>
JANEWAY: I've learned a few interesting things about that relay
station. It's generating as much energy every minute as a typical star
puts out in a year. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's amazing to me is that someone a hundred thousand years
ago was harvesting microsingularities. <br>
JANEWAY: If nobody shows up to protest, I'd like to stay here for a
while. Try to find the answers to some of these questions. This is the
kind of archaeological puzzle that's always fascinated me. Want a cup? <br>
CHAKOTAY: No, thanks. You haven't mentioned your letter. Who was it
from? <br>
JANEWAY: It was from Mark, the man I was engaged to. He told me about
the litter of puppies my dog had, and how he found homes for them. How
devastated he was when Voyager was lost. How he held out hopes we were
alive longer than most people did until he realised that he was
clinging to a fantasy. So he began living his life again. Meeting
people, letting go of the past. About four months ago, he married a
woman who works with him. He's very happy. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How do you feel about that? <br>
JANEWAY: Well, I knew he'd eventually move on with his life. But there
was such a finality to that letter. <br>
KIM [OC]: Kim to the captain. Can you come to the bridge? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: What is it? <br>
KIM: We've picked up an automated distress signal from Tuvok's shuttle.
Sensors show there's no one on board. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Hirogen
ship]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Tuvok wakes up on the deck, arms tied securely behind his back. Seven is nearby, also bound.)<br>TUVOK:
Seven. Seven of Nine. <br>
SEVEN: Where are we? <br>
TUVOK: I assume we're on the alien ship. <br>
SEVEN: This is most uncomfortable. Have you seen anyone? <br>
TUVOK: No. If we can reach one of those blades perhaps we can cut
through these bindings. <br>(An Hirogen enters.)<br>
ALPHA: You were pathetic prey. Easily taken. <br>(He pulls Tuvok to his feet, then Seven.)<br>ALPHA: The hunt was not
satisfying. I want information. Why do you violate our property? I
could snap your puny neck with one twist. Hardly worth taking. Answer
me. Why do you use our modules? <br>
TUVOK: We're trying to retrieve important messages from our home.
Return us to our ship and we'll be on our way without trespassing
again. <br>
ALPHA: I took you in a fair hunt. I claim the relics of the chase. <br>(He puts a red mark over Seven's right eye.)<br>ALPHA: Are
the others on your ship able to put up more of a fight than you? <br>
SEVEN: You will find our captain a formidable opponent and our ship
heavily armed. <br>
ALPHA: Good. Strong prey makes for a better hunt. <br>(He marks Tuvok.)<br>
TUVOK: Release us now and you'll be safe. Otherwise we will destroy
you. <br>
BETA: Pitiful relics. <br>
ALPHA: They 'are the first of their kind. I will be envied. <br>
BETA: I've located their ship. It's four thousand ketriks from the
module. <br>
ALPHA: We'll be there within the hour. Go to stalking mode. Why do you
hesitate? <br>
BETA: The rest of the group is on its way. <br>
ALPHA: I wanted to claim this prey for myself. <br>
BETA: We may not be able to take them alone. We need the strength of
the others. <br>
ALPHA: I won't share prey with the others. These two must be the only
relics. Prepare them. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
Captain, it's tricky to scan through the interference, but I think I'm
detecting a ship. <br>
JANEWAY: What kind of ship? <br>
KIM: Let me reconfigure the sensor array. It's Hirogen, and Tuvok and
Seven are on it. <br>
JANEWAY: Hail them. <br>
KIM: On screen. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm Captain Janeway of the starship Voyager. You have two of
my crew on board. <br>
ALPHA [on viewscreen]: Disconnect your link with our module and leave
this space. <br>
JANEWAY: Not without my people. <br>
ALPHA [on viewscreen]: They are my relics. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm prepared to offer you something for their safe return.
Surely we can come to an agreement? <br>
ALPHA [on viewscreen]: If the rest of my group arrives, you will be
taken as well. I'm giving you a chance to run. <br>
JANEWAY: We don't run. <br>
KIM: Captain, I've got three more ships on sensors, coming towards us at
high warp. <br>
ALPHA [on viewscreen]: Don't be foolish. Leave now and save yourselves.
<br>
JANEWAY: Give me my people and we'll do just that. <br>
ALPHA [on viewscreen]: They're mine. <br>
JANEWAY: Then get ready for a fight. Red alert. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Hirogen

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> ALPHA:
Are they prepared? <br>
BETA: Yes. But now is not the time for it. We should wait until the
others arrive and take the ship. <br>
ALPHA: I want to make the first kill. You will verify it. <br>
BETA: If there's a battle, we must join it. <br>
ALPHA: The others can wage the battle. <br>
BETA: Perhaps you are more interested in collecting relics. Perhaps
your judgment is clouded. <br>
ALPHA: Don't question me again. We do it now. <br>
TUVOK: I suggest you think carefully about your decision. If you kill
us, our captain will hunt you down and show no mercy. <br>
ALPHA: I'm not concerned. Lower the harness. A long, coiled intestine.
An interesting trophy. <br>
SEVEN: What possible use could you make of my intestines? <br>
ALPHA: Unusual relics are prized. Yours will make me envied by men and
pursued by women. <br>
SEVEN: You are a crude species. Only your size makes you formidable. <br>
ALPHA: Your insults are as pitiful as your efforts to escape. This one
first. I want the female to witness what will happen to her. Their bone
structure makes cutting through the back difficult. This will take
time. </font></p>

JANEWAY: How are you coming? <br>
KIM: The ship has some kind of monotanium armour plating. It's
scattering the targeting beam. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The other three ships are closing. They're within six
thousand kilometres. <br>
PARIS: Captain, those ships have massive weapons. They've definitely
got us outgunned. <br>
JANEWAY: Harry, let me see those ships in relation to the relay
station. <br>
KIM: Yes ma'am. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe we can use that quantum singularity to our advantage. <br>
KIM: How? <br>
JANEWAY: If we can boost the effect of the singularity, increase the
gravitational pull, we might be able to stop them. <br>
KIM: The pull would increase if we could weaken the station's
containment field. An antithoron burst might do it. <br>
PARIS: If we're not careful we might be pulled in as well. <br>
JANEWAY: Don't worry, we're going to be ready for it. Harry, create a
low level warp field around Voyager. Sublight energy level. That
should help counteract the gravitational pull. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If the field is too strong, we won't be able to beam Tuvok and
Seven aboard. <br>
JANEWAY: Then you'll have to find the right balance, won't you, Harry? <br>
KIM: Yes, ma'am. <br>
JANEWAY: On my mark, direct a level eight antithoron burst towards the
station. Have thrusters ready for full reverse, Mister Paris. <br>
PARIS: Understood. <br>
KIM: I've established a low level warp field, Captain. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Antithoron system is online. <br>

PARIS: Captain, they're firing. <br>(Things go bang.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Their weapons are destabilising the containment field. <br>
JANEWAY: This is Janeway. Stop firing. You're putting yourselves in
grave danger. <br>
KIM: The field is going. The singularity is about to be exposed. <br>(The array implodes into a black hole, pulling Hirogen ships into itself.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, the ship with Tuvok and Seven is still being pulled
in. <br>
JANEWAY: Get a tractor beam on it. <br>

now the gravity well could scatter their patterns. <br>

buckle. <br>
PARIS: We're going in. <br>

Captain, look at this. The energy released from the singularity created
a massive discharge along the relay network. It disabled every one of
the stations. <br>

I learned very little about them, but I believe we should consider them
extremely dangerous. They seem to lack any moral centre. <br>

TUVOK: No. I assume they used it for communications, as we did. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, they won't be using it any more. <br>

Except for some maintenance that's needed on the warp coils, everything
seems fine. <br>

CHAKOTAY: Thanks. <br>
JANEWAY: Cream and sugar, huh? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Two sugars. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, two sugars? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You know, you drink too much of that stuff. <br>
JANEWAY: Really? <br>
CHAKOTAY: If I'm not mistaken that's your third cup this morning. <br>
JANEWAY: Fourth. And on a day like today, it won't be my last. Coffee -
the finest organic suspension ever devised. It's got me through the
worst of the last three years. I beat the Borg with it. Oh, I'm sure
Voyager will be fine, but I'm worried that the crew might be a
different story. I think they were hoping mail call would become a
regular part of their day. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Neelix is putting together an impromptu party. He thought it
might cheer them up. <br>
JANEWAY: Good idea. When will it be? <br>
CHAKOTAY: As soon as he can get people together. <br>
JANEWAY: Leave it to Neelix to come up with the right idea at the right
time. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How are you doing? <br>
JANEWAY: Me? I'm fine. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You'd say that if you'd just had your legs torn off by a
Traykan Beast. Look what you've been through in the last few days. We
finally make a connection with home and then it's ripped away from us.
We manage to make another enemy who's going to try and hunt us down and
destroy us, and on top of that <br>
JANEWAY: It's all right. You can say it. On top of all that, I got a
Dear John letter. It wasn't really a surprise. I guess I didn't really
expect him to wait for me considering the circumstances. It made me
realise that I was using him as a safety net, you know, as a way to
avoid becoming involved with someone else. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You don't have that safety net any more. <br>
JANEWAY: That's right. Then again, my life is far from uneventful here
in the Delta Quadrant. It's not like I would have had a chance to
pursue a relationship, even if I had realised I was alone. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You're hardly alone, and to my way of thinking, there's still
plenty of time. <br>
JANEWAY: Plenty of time. <br>
NEELIX: Neelix to the ready room. The party's about to begin and there
are only two people missing. <br>
JANEWAY: We're on our way. <br>(Chakotay offers Janeway his arm, and they leave together.) </font> </p>
