(Lieutenant Carey sits up from the biobed, blood streaming from his
nose.) <br>
CAREY: She's not just out of control, she's out of her mind.<br>
TUVOK: If you will explain what happened, Lieutenant.<br>
CAREY: She hit me is what happened!<br>
EMH: Your nose is broken in three places. I'll need to reset the
ethmoid fossa. Try not to move.<br>
CAREY: We were having a disagreement about the power grid. She wanted
to realign the lateral plasma conduit. I told her that would cause an
overload. As usual, she wouldn't listen. So I told her to step aside
and let me handle it. She pushed me away from the console. I pushed
back. Next thing I knew, I was lying on the deck with blood pouring
down my face.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Then what happened?<br>
CAREY: She said, 'Sorry. Maybe you should go to Sickbay.'<br>
EMH: At least she gave you some good advice. Now <br>
CAREY: Ow!<br>
EMH: Hold still.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Don't worry, Lieutenant. I'll take care of this.<br>
CAREY: You keep that woman out of my engine room and everything will be
fine! Ow! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
Where is Miss Torres?<br>
CHAKOTAY: I've confined her to quarters.<br>
TUVOK: I would like her moved to the brig until formal charges can be
filed.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Formal charges? Come on, Tuvok. We're seventy five years away
from the nearest court. Are you really going to hold her in the brig
for that long?<br>
TUVOK: The Captain has the authority to try Miss Torres here on the
ship, considering the extenuating circumstances.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Well, I'd like to settle this on my own without filing
charges and without involving the Captain.<br>
TUVOK: She struck a fellow officer. That is a court martial offence.<br>
CHAKOTAY: She's a Maquis, and in the Maquis, sometimes you have to push
people out of your way to get things done.<br>
TUVOK: Miss Torres is no longer a member of the Maquis, and with all
due respect, Commander, neither are you. Allowing Miss Torres to get
away with a clear violation of regulations sets a bad example for the
rest of the crew. It makes it appear as though you were showing
favouritism toward the Maquis.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Look, Lieutenant, I don't have to explain myself to you. I'll
deal with B'Elanna personally, and then I'll inform the Captain. You're
to drop this matter. That's an order.<br>
TUVOK: I will yield my authority in this case to you. However, I will
make a full report in my security log.<br>
(Chakotay steps into the turbolift.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: You do that. <br>
(The doors close and Tuvok walks away. <br>
Chakotay gets out on another floor and is joined by two of his Maquis
crew.) <br>
JARVIN: Sir, we heard what happened. What are they going to do with
B'Elanna?<br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't know yet but I'll handle it.<br>
SESKA: We heard that Captain Janeway's going to put her in the brig for
two months, and that all the Maquis are going to be restricted to
quarters when they're not on duty.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Not true.<br>
SESKA: We just want you to know that if things do get our of hand,
we're ready to back you.<br>
CHAKOTAY: What does that mean?<br>
JARVIN: In case you want to take control of the ship, you have our full
support.<br>
CHAKOTAY: If I ever hear you talk that way again, I'll personally throw
you in the brig for mutiny. </font></p>

throws a bowl at it. The door opens and the bowl just misses Chakotay.)
<br>
TORRES: Argh!<br>
CHAKOTAY: Here.<br>
(Chakotay hands her a PADD.) <br>
TORRES: What's this?<br>
CHAKOTAY: The medical report on Lieutenant Carey.<br>
TORRES: Lieutenant Carey is an idiot! When I tell you what happened <br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't want to hear it! You might be interested to know that
the impact fractures along his cranium were pretty severe. If you'd hit
him just a little harder, you could have driven some of those bones
into his cerebellum.<br>
TORRES: I didn't even come close to hitting him that hard.<br>
CHAKOTAY: So on the one side, I'm facing a Vulcan who wants
court-martial you. And on the other, I'm facing all the Maquis who are
ready to seize this ship over this. You've turned this into one lousy
day for me, Torres.<br>
TORRES: So how long do I have to stay in here?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Rest of the trip. Seventy five years.<br>
TORRES: I've never found your twisted sense of humour very funny,
Chakotay.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Or I could send you back to work with the understanding that
you'll apologise to <br>
TORRES: Apologise? He was the one who <br>
CHAKOTAY: Not just a simple apology. A personal one, over a hot cup of
pejuta. Bond with the man.<br>
TORRES: I am not going to bond with him.<br>
CHAKOTAY: You're going to need support from people like Carey.<br>
TORRES: I don't need support from anybody.<br>
CHAKOTAY: You are if you're going to be Chief Engineer of this ship.<br>
TORRES: Huh. Right.<br>
CHAKOTAY: This is not another example of my twisted sense of humour.<br>
TORRES: But Carey is next in line.<br>
CHAKOTAY: You're a better engineer than he is.<br>
TORRES: What does the Captain have to say about this?<br>
CHAKOTAY: She hasn't said a word, because I haven't told her yet. </font></p>

Captain's log, Stardate 48439.7. As we maintain a course back to the
Alpha Quadrant, we're conducting what would normally be routine
maintenance to the ship. Routine, that is, if we had access to a
starbase. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PARIS:
Engine efficiency's down another fourteen percent. If we don't get more
power to the warp drive, we're all going to have to get out and push.<br>
JANEWAY: What about alternative energy sources? Ensign Kim, have you
had any luck getting power from the holodeck reactors?<br>
KIM: Not yet. We tried hooking them to the power grid and we ended up
blowing out half the relays. The holodeck's energy matrix, it just
isn't compatible with the other power systems.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, if we relocate all security personnel to deck seven,
we can shut down power on deck nine and reroute it to propulsion.<br>
TUVOK: That would be inconvenient, but acceptable.<br>
JANEWAY: Fine. Now let's move on to the personnel situation. We still
have <br>
(Neelix and Kes enter.) <br>
NEELIX: Sorry we're late, but I wasn't informed there was a meeting
this morning. Oh, there don't seem to be enough chairs.<br>
JANEWAY: Neelix, this is a briefing for the senior officers.<br>
NEELIX: I see. Well, I, I am the senior Talaxian on board. Kes is the
senior Ocampa. And I do know more about this region of space than any
other member of the crew.<br>
KES: We have some excellent suggestions, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Very well. You're welcome to join us, this time.<br>
(Paris gives up his seat to Kes.) <br>
PARIS: Here you are.<br>
JANEWAY: To be honest, we could use some excellent suggestions right
now.<br>
KES: I've been thinking that you might be able to convert one of your
lower decks into a hydroponics bay to grow your own food. I understand
that the replicators are down and that the emergency rations won't hold
out much longer.<br>
KIM: What about Cargo Bay two? It was designed for organic storage and
it already has adjustable environmental controls.<br>
JANEWAY: When can you start?<br>
KES: Me?<br>
JANEWAY: It's your idea. It's your project.<br>
KES: Right away.<br>
NEELIX: I can do some wonderful things with vegetables, Captain. My
feragoit goulash is known across twelve star systems.<br>
JANEWAY: Okay. The personnel situation. We've managed to find a
replacement for the Transporter Chief, but we still need an Astrogation
plotter, a Chief Engineer, medical support personnel. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I've made a list of several Maquis crew members who would
make good officers.<br>
(Chakotay passes her his PADD.) <br>
JANEWAY: B'Elanna Torres? She was the one involved in that incident
with Mister Carey.<br>
CHAKOTAY: That's right.<br>
JANEWAY: Just what job do you think she's suited for?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Chief Engineer.<br>
JANEWAY: You're serious.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Very.<br>
JANEWAY: Regarding Sickbay, we still need a Chief Medical Officer.<br>
NEELIX: What about that electronic man down in Sickbay?<br>
TUVOK: It is an Emergency Medical Hologram and its abilities are
limited. It can only operate within the confines of Sickbay.<br>
PARIS: Not to mention its lousy bedside manner.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Perhaps we should assign somebody to train with the hologram
as a field medic.<br>
JANEWAY: Good idea. Lieutenant, I understand you studied biochemistry
at the Academy.<br>
PARIS: Er, only two semesters.<br>
JANEWAY: Close enough. You just volunteered to become a field medic.
Report to Sickbay as soon as we're finished here.<br>
PARIS: But Captain <br>

JANEWAY: Report!<br>
SESKA: We're running into some kind of spatial distortion.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok!<br>
TUVOK: The distortions are emanating from a highly localized
disturbance in the space-time continuum. Distance, twenty thousand
kilometres off the port bow.<br>
JANEWAY: All stop. On screen. Gravimetric flux density is over two
thousand percent. If I'm not mistaken, we're looking at a type four
quantum singularity.<br>
TUVOK: Captain, I am receiving an audio transmission from within the
singularity.<br>
JANEWAY: On speakers. <br>
(A female sounding voice, but the words are garbled.) <br>
KIM: I think I've found the source of the transmission. <br>
(The distant image of a ship appears on the viewscreen against the
black hole.) <br>
JANEWAY: Does it look like any ship you're familiar with?<br>
NEELIX: No, nothing I recognise. But then it's, it's so hard to make
out.<br>
JANEWAY: They may be trapped in the event horizon. Open a channel. This
is Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Starship Voyager to the vessel near
the quantum singularity. Do you need help?<br>
KES: Event horizon?<br>
NEELIX: A singularity is a star that's collapsed in on itself. The
event horizon is a very powerful energy field surrounding it. Why, er,
once on a particularly dangerous trade mission to the twin stars of
Keloda, I myself was almost trapped inside<br>
TUVOK: No response to our hail, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Can we tractor the vessel out?<br>
KIM: No. The subspace interference is too heavy.<br>
NEELIX: Captain, we're less than three light years from Ilidaria. They
have sophisticated technology. They might be able to help and they're
quite friendly, most of the time.<br>
JANEWAY: No. It looks like it's being pulled in toward the singularity.
We have to get it out of the event horizon.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Bridge to Torres. We need a way to get that ship out of
there. Any ideas?<br>

JANEWAY: We have a problem and I think it's time we discussed it.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, I appreciate your concerns about Torres, but I
promise you <br>
JANEWAY: You don't understand, Commander. This isn't about Torres. My
problem is with you.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Me?<br>
JANEWAY: Let me be blunt. What you tried to do just now was out of line.<br>
CHAKOTAY: In what way?<br>
JANEWAY: When you decided to call Torres in Engineering.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I've worked with her. I know what she's capable of. We needed
an answer right away and I knew she could give us one.<br>
JANEWAY: Carey is the senior officer in Engineering.<br>
CHAKOTAY: If you look at it that way, none of my people will ever have
seniority.<br>
JANEWAY: That's the problem, right there. They're not your people.
You're treating the Maquis on this ship like they're still your crew.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm doing everything I can to integrate them into your crew,
but frankly, you're not making it easy for me, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: I can't make it easy, Commander. Surely you can understand
that. They don't have the discipline. They don't have the training.<br>
CHAKOTAY: But some of them, like B'Elanna Torres have the ability.<br>
JANEWAY: The Starfleet officers on this ship have worked all their
lives to earn their commissions. How am I supposed to ask them to
accept a Maquis as their superior officer just because circumstances
have forced us together?<br>
CHAKOTAY: You're asking them to accept me.<br>
JANEWAY: You're qualified. You're a graduate of the Academy, and you
have Starfleet command experience.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Permission to speak freely.<br>
JANEWAY: Go ahead.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I have no intention of being your token Maquis officer.<br>
JANEWAY: Show me another qualified Maquis candidate and I'll consider
him.<br>
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna Torres.<br>
JANEWAY: Who cannot control herself and who could not make it through
the Academy.<br>
CHAKOTAY: She's the best engineer I've ever known. She could teach at
the Academy. You're right, Captain. I do consider these my people
because nobody else on this ship will look out for them like I will.
And I'm telling you, you're going to have to give them more authority
if you want their loyalty.<br>
JANEWAY: Theirs or yours, Commander?<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm trying to help you. I'm sorry you don't see that. I
strongly recommend you get to know Torres before you choose a new Chief
Engineer. Permission to leave.<br>

JANEWAY: Report.<br>
CHAKOTAY: It looks like we're running into more spatial distortions.<br>
KIM: I'm picking up a highly localised disturbance off the port bow.<br>
JANEWAY: On screen. Mister Tuvok?<br>
TUVOK: It is another type four quantum singularity. Physical and
temporal dimensions are identical to the one we encountered earlier.<br>
PARIS: Captain, according to these readings, we've returned to our
previous co-ordinates. This isn't another singularity. It's the same
one. <br>
JANEWAY: Check the navigational logs. Confirm our position.<br>
KIM: Well, they show we've travelled one point four light years away
from the anomaly, but I've confirmed our position against the star
chart. We're definitely back where we started. Doesn't make sense.<br>
PARIS: They can't both be right. We're either still at the singularity
or we're not.<br>
JANEWAY: Well, we can see the singularity so I tend to believe that the
external sensors are correct.<br>
TUVOK: That would imply there was something wrong with the warp drive
and the navigational logs.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Paris, lay in a course away from the singularity. This
time at maximum warp. Ensign Kim, I want you to keep a sensor lock on
the singularity. Verify that we're moving away from it. Engage. <br>
KIM: Distance from the singularity is ten million kilometres and
increasing.<br>
PARIS: Warp engines holding steady. All systems report normal.<br>
KIM: Eleven million. Twelve million. (beep beep) I don't get it. Mister
Paris, have we altered course?<br>
PARIS: No. We're still steady on three one zero mark two one five.<br>
KIM: Then something's really wrong here. It's ahead of us again.<br>
SESKA: Confirmed. We're back at the same co-ordinates.<br>
JANEWAY: All stop. Ensign Kim, transfer all the data on spatial
distortions we encountered to my ready room. I'm going to begin my own
analysis. Commander, have all departments run complete system
diagnostics. I'll expect a full report from all senior officers at
fifteen hundred hours.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Who will represent Engineering?<br>
JANEWAY: Lieutenant Carey.<br>
CHAKOTAY: You should invite B'Elanna Torres as well, unless you've
removed her from consideration.<br>
JANEWAY: Fine. </font></font></p>

afternoon.<br>
TORRES: Oh. Well, I'll give you a full report on what happens.<br>
CAREY: I'll be there too. Just remember, Torres, I'm the senior officer
and I speak for Engineering. Try not to say anything unless someone
asks you a question. Fifteen hundred hours, deck one. Don't be late. <br>

I've taken a look at every major subsystem and there's no sign of any
trouble.<br>
TUVOK: What about the navigational array?<br>
KIM: I'll have the results in about an hour. So, I hear there's been
some trouble down in Engineering.<br>
TUVOK: There was an altercation, but it has been resolved.<br>
KIM: That's not what I hear. I hear that the whole department's up in
arms, that the Maquis and Starfleet people are almost at each other's
throats.<br>
TUVOK: I will never cease to be amazed by the human capacity for
hyperbole. The situation may be characterised as tense, but one could
hardly say that they're about to become violent.<br>
KIM: I just hope you're right. Things are bad enough around here
without, ow!<br>
TUVOK: Are you all right?<br>
KIM: Yeah. I just have this splitting headache and <br>
(Kim falls to his knees.) <br>
TUVOK: I'd better get you to Sickbay.<br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> EMH [on
monitor]: Twenty seven other crew members have now reported the
symptoms. And yet, when I examined each of them, I couldn't find
anything wrong. I have no diagnosis, no prognosis, no recommended
treatment. I'll contact you when I have something more to contribute.
And by the way, I am now sixty eight centimetres shorter. I'd
appreciated it if someone would repair my holographic projectors before
I have trouble reaching my patients. <br>
(Transmission ends.) <br>
JANEWAY: I finished my study of the spatial distortions coming from the
singularity. I can give you a long, boring analysis. Suffice it to say,
I don't know what's going on. The readings are confused, the data is
contradictory. None of it makes any sense. Anyone have anything more
constructive? <br>
TUVOK: Ship-wide diagnostics have revealed nothing out of the ordinary.<br>
CAREY: I tried sending out a tachyon signal to scan the singularity but
all I got back was static.<br>
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna, do you think you can work with Mister Carey to
clean up that signal?<br>
TORRES: Yes.<br>
JANEWAY: Good.<br>
TORRES: But it won't work. I mean, it was a good idea to try it but it
won't work.<br>
JANEWAY: You have another idea?<br>
TORRES: I was just thinking about the problem with the Doctor's
holographic projectors. It seems like the spatial distortions might be
interfering with the projectors phase alignment.<br>
JANEWAY: That was my guess too.<br>
TORRES: If that's the case, I could screen out those distortions by
setting up a localised dampening field around the projectors.<br>
CAREY: Is our priority here really the Medical Holograph system?<br>
TORRES: My point is, that if the spatial distortions are also
interfering with the transmission we received from the other ship <br>
JANEWAY: We could set up a similar field around our external sensors
and communicate with them.<br>
TORRES: Exactly. And they may know more about what's going on than we
do.<br>
JANEWAY: Let's give it a try. Dismissed. <br>

a nod.) </font></font></p>

TORRES: Ramping up field intensity.<br>
KIM: It's working. We're cutting through the distortions. <br>

more.<br>
KIM: Compensating for amplitude distortion. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: This is Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Starship Voyager

CHAKOTAY: That's your hail.<br>
TORRES: I'm applying the damping field to our visual scanners. I'll see
if I can clarify the image. <br>
PARIS: It's the Voyager. It's us. <br>
(Everyone stares at the viewscreen.) <br>
PARIS: Sensors confirm it's definitely USS Voyager.<br>
TUVOK: I've been hailing the ship on all frequencies. No response.<br>
JANEWAY: I don't think you'll get a response, Lieutenant. That message
we unscrambled is the same message I sent out nine hours ago.<br>
KIM: Could we have travelled back in time and met ourselves?<br>
TORRES: No, that's not it. I think I have an explanation. </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2">
TORRES: Think of it like this. You're sitting at the bottom of a pond,
which is frozen over, and you look up at the surface and you see a
reflection of yourself. Now, you might think you're looking at another
person sitting at the bottom of another pond, looking back at you.<br>
JANEWAY: And in this case, we'd be staring up at the surface of the
event horizon and seeing a time-delayed reflection of ourselves.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Are you saying we're the ones trapped in the singularity? <br>
TORRES: Unfortunately, yes. <br>
JANEWAY: You're right. It's the only theory that explains everything
that's happened to us. We've probably been in this singularity since we
felt the first jolt.<br>
PARIS: Wait a minute. Wait. Wait a minute. Let me get this straight. We
were cruising along at warp seven, then we pick up a distress call and
moved in to investigate. But now you're saying that the other ship is
actually just a reflection of us and that the distress call is actually
just the Captain's opening hail. But we picked up the distress call
before she sent the hail. How could we have been seeing a reflection of
something we hadn't even done yet? Am I making any sense here? <br>
JANEWAY: No, but that's okay. One of the more difficult concepts to
grasp in temporal mechanics is that sometimes effect can precede cause.
A reaction can be observed before the action which initiated it. <br>
KIM: So what do we do to get out?<br>
TORRES: I'm not sure. But I do know one thing. That as we slide deeper
into the singularity, the spatial distortions are increasing. According
to my calculations, within nine hours, they'll crush the ship.<br>
JANEWAY: If your analogy's correct, how do we get through that sheet of
ice?<br>
TORRES: Look for a crack.<br>
JANEWAY: Or make a crack. Take something and smack it into the ice
until it buckles.<br>
TORRES: Wait a minute. What if we've already made a crack in the ice?<br>
JANEWAY: When we first entered the event horizon.<br>
(Er, how do you make a hole in gravity?) <br>
TORRES: If we could find our entry point, we might be able to slip out
the way we came in.<br>
JANEWAY: So we'd be looking for a subspace instability in the event
horizon. What would make it show up on our sensors?<br>
TORRES + JANEWAY: Warp particles.<br>
JANEWAY: If we saturate the event horizon with warp particles, we might
be able to see the escaping through the rupture we made when we
entered. </font></font></p>

JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok, take the main deflector off-line. Mister Kim,
reroute the port and starboard plasma flow to the main deflector. We
can use it to generate a warp field.<br>
TUVOK: Deflectors off-line.<br>
KIM: Initialising plasma flow.<br>
JANEWAY: Release the warp particles. <br>
(An orange beam hits the black hole, lighting it up.) <br>
PARIS: Scanning the singularity.<br>
TORRES: Anything?<br>
KIM: Not yet. Warp particles at full intensity.<br>
PARIS: I'm picking up something. A slight irregularity. It could be a
rupture in the event horizon.<br>
JANEWAY: Put it on screen. <br>
PARIS: It is a rupture, Captain. It's fifteen metres by ten metres.<br>
TORRES: Oh, it's too small. It must have collapsed since we first
passed through it.<br>
JANEWAY: We found the crack. That's the important thing. Now, how do we
make it bigger.<br>
TORRES: Put a wedge in it and force it open. We could try a dekyon beam.<br>
JANEWAY: All right, a dekyon beam. Mister Paris, bring us closer.<br>
PARIS: Captain, if we get too close to the rupture our warp engines
might make it collapse even further.<br>
JANEWAY: Can we emit a beam from here?<br>
KIM: The rupture's over fifty million kilometres away. We don't have
enough power to project a dekyon beam that far.<br>
JANEWAY: We'll have to take a shuttlecraft.<br>
PARIS: You'll need the best pilot you've got in that shuttle, Captain.
That'll be me.<br>
JANEWAY: Getting there is the easy part, Mister Paris. We need someone
who's familiar with the finer points of temporal mechanics, and unless
you've been hiding your credentials, I don't think that's you.
B'Elanna, you're with me. The Bridge is yours, Commander. </font></font></p>

TORRES: Shields at full strength.<br>
JANEWAY: We'll reach the rupture in approximately four and a half
minutes. Let's get that dekyon beam online.<br>
TORRES: Remodulating emitters. Captain, I want to apologise for losing
my temper in your Ready room. I think maybe you were hitting a little
bit too close to home, you know? I respect Chakotay but he's wrong. I'm
not officer material and we both know it. The truth is, I quit the
Academy because I realised I couldn't make it in Starfleet, and believe
me, no one was sorry to see me go.<br>
JANEWAY: Professor Chapman was.<br>
TORRES: What?<br>
JANEWAY: He put a letter in your permanent file saying that should you
ever re-apply, he would support you. He thought you were one of the
most promising cadets he'd ever taught.<br>
TORRES: I fought with him almost every day. I was always questioning
his, his methods, his assumptions, and he was always slapping me down
like some upstart kid. I was surprised he didn't help me pack my bags.<br>
JANEWAY: Some professors like students who challenge their assumptions,
B'Elanna. And so do some captains. Professor Chapman wasn't alone. Many
of your teachers thought you had the potential to be an outstanding
officer. You had more friends at the Academy than you realised. We're
fifteen kilometres from the rupture. Start charging the dekyon beam.<br>
TORRES: Dekyon beam online. (bang) Shields down to sixty two percent.<br>
JANEWAY: Increase speed. We have to get to that rupture before these
spatial distortions tear us apart. All right. Let's open this hole in
the ice a little wider. Initiate the dekyon beam. </font></font></p>

they've been damaged. Their comm. system's down. I am unable to raise

leaves us with less than two metres clearance on either side.<br>

lay in a course toward the rupture and take us out.<br>

TORRES: Well, this is a problem.<br>
JANEWAY: One of them is a temporal reflection, but which one? I'm
getting identical readings from both ships.<br>
TORRES: Captain, the rupture is starting to collapse again. If Voyager
doesn't get through it within the next five minutes, they'll never get
out.<br>
JANEWAY: That means we have one chance to pick the correct ship.<br>
TORRES: Simple choice. Port or starboard?<br>
JANEWAY: Starboard.<br>
TORRES: Port. The port ship is more likely to be the real one. It's
closer to the rupture. That means, <br>
(The shaking starts again.) <br>
TORRES: That means they're holding position as close as they can to the
rupture, waiting for us to dock before they head out.<br>
JANEWAY: No. It may be closer to the rupture, but it's facing the wrong
direction. The starboard ship is facing away from us. That means
they're trying to give us easy access to the shuttlebay.<br>
TORRES: There has to be some way to tell them apart besides which
direction they're facing.<br>
JANEWAY: The starboard ship's thrusters are at standby. They're holding
position. But the port ship is moving toward the rupture.<br>
TORRES: Then I was right. It's the port ship. They're heading out.<br>
JANEWAY: Don't you see? Voyager did move toward the rupture twenty
minutes ago when we first discovered it. That's why the port ship is
moving toward it now. It's a time-delayed reflection of what we did
before. The starboard ship's the real one. They're waiting for us.<br>
TORRES: If you're wrong, we're going to have a long time to debate it. <br>
(The shuttlecraft heads towards the visible hangar deck.) <br>
TORRES: We're ready to dock.<br>
JANEWAY: All right. Cut the thrusters. Let's see what happens. (Bump as
they come to a halt on the deck.) Feels like a real ship to me. Let's

TORRES: That's too narrow. We're not going to make it.<br>
JANEWAY: In command school, they taught us to always remember that
manoeuvring a starship is a very delicate process. But over the years
I've learned that sometimes you just have to punch your way through.
