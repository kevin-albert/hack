CHAKOTAY: Where are you headed? <br>
TORRES: The bridge. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Mind if I walk with you? <br>
TORRES: Not at all. <br>
CHAKOTAY: So, how's it going? <br>
TORRES: Not bad, I guess. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok still giving you a hard time? <br>
TORRES: No more than usual. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't know about you, but when I think about spending
seventy years on the same ship with that guy, it gives me a headache. I
get the impression a lot of the crew agrees with me. Maquis and
Starfleet. </font></p>

Bridge. So, what do you think? <br>
TORRES: About what? <br>
CHAKOTAY: About what I've been saying. That a lot of the crew aren't
too happy with our Chief of Security. And for that matter, I don't
think Captain Janeway's winning any popularity contests either. Don't
you agree? <br>
TORRES: Why do I get the feeling that you're testing me? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Let's just say I'm interested in your opinion. <br>
TORRES: Why? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You're a good officer. I like you. And I wouldn't want to see
you get hurt. <br>
TORRES: Computer, halt turbolift. Look, what's this all about? <br>
CHAKOTAY: There're going to be some changes around here. All of the
Maquis are in line, and about twenty five of the Starfleet crew are
with us. <br>
TORRES: Are you saying there's going to be a mutiny? <br>
CHAKOTAY: And when the shooting starts, I'm going to need to know which
side you're on. </font></p>

Well, Commander, Voyager's all yours. <br>
CHAKOTAY: There's a first time for everything, I guess. Don't worry,
Captain, I'll keep your ship safe and sound. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sure you will. <br>
PARIS [OC]: Shuttlebay to Captain Janeway. <br>
JANEWAY: Go ahead, Mister Paris. <br>
PARIS [OC]: The shuttle's ready to go whenever you are. <br>
JANEWAY: On my way. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, I've been thinking. Are you sure you don't want to
take Lieutenant Tuvok with you, just in case the Rukani turn out to be
less friendly than they seem? <br>
TUVOK: I assure you, Commander. I have made thorough preparations for
the Captain's safety during her away mission. You, on the other hand,
are still adapting to your duties as First Officer. Under the
circumstances, I believe my time will be better spent assisting you in
your effort to justify the trust the Captain has placed in you. <br>
JANEWAY: I appreciate your concern for my safety, Mister Chakotay, but
Tuvok's right. Lieutenant Paris and I will be just fine. I'll see you
in twenty four hours. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Lieutenant, I want you to keep close tabs on the Captain's
shuttle. Let's make sure she doesn't run into any trouble. <br>
TUVOK: Aye, sir. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Ensign, let's shut down those transporters and start that
diagnostic we've been putting off. <br>
KIM: Sir, are you sure we shouldn't wait for the Captain to get back? <br>
TUVOK: Ensign Kim, you have been given a direct order. Do as the
Commander tells you. <br>
KIM: Aye, sir. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Have you finished upgrading the internal sensors, Ensign? <br>
(Torres is at Mission Ops 2.) <br>
TORRES: I'm working on it, sir. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I hope so. <br>
(Two security men enter by the door next to Tuvok's station. Chakotay
takes a PADD from one of them.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Wait here. <br>
TUVOK: Is something wrong, sir? <br>
CHAKOTAY: No, it's just tomorrow's duty roster. <br>
TUVOK: Sir, Captain Janeway's shuttle has gone to warp. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Thank you, Tuvok. Chakotay to all hands. Let's do it. <br>
TUVOK: Sir? <br>
(Chakotay shoots Tuvok. One security guard shoots the helmsman, the
other just misses Kim.) <br>
KIM: Red alert! Security to the Bridge! <br>
CHAKOTAY: You're wasting your time, Harry. All my teams have taken
control of Security, Engineering and all key systems. <br>
KIM: You'll never get away with this. People will fight back. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's going to be a little difficult. All your off-duty
Starfleet friends have been locked down in quarters. <br>
(Kim is about to shoot Chakotay, but Ensign Torres gets him first.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: I guess you've made your choice. <br>
JONAS [OC]: Jonas to Chakotay. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Go ahead. <br>
JONAS [OC]: They're putting up a fight on deck two. We could use some
help. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Carlson, O'Donnell, get these people to the brig. Ayala, take
the conn and move us out of com range of Janeway's shuttle. You're with
me. </font></p>

TORRES: Right. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Are you okay? <br>
TORRES: To tell you the truth, shooting Harry got me a little rattled. <br>
CHAKOTAY: He's only stunned. We're not going to kill anybody today,
unless it's absolutely necessary. Just stay close. </font></p>

CHAKOTAY: We'll just have to shoot our way past them. Ready? <br>
(They shoot down the guards, one is taken out by a Bajoran woman with a
phaser rifle.) <br>
TORRES: Seska! <br>
SESKA: It's just like old times, isn't it? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Thanks for the help. <br>
SESKA: We've got to get moving. Some of Janeway's people are trying to
set up a command centre in the mess hall. </font></p>

SESKA: I wouldn't do that if I were you. This phaser's set on wide
beam. I could take you all in one shot. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Everybody, drop your weapons. <br>
NEELIX: You heard the man. Drop your weapons. Don't look so surprised,
Commander. I know a winner when I see one. I'm with you. <br>
SESKA: Do you want me to shoot him? <br>
CHAKOTAY: We're still going to need a cook. Chakotay to Engineering.
What's your status? <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: Engineering is secure. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Transporter rooms one and two, status. <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: Transporter room one is under control. <br>
CREWWOMAN [OC]: Transporter room two is secure. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Shuttlebay, status. <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: Shuttlebay is secured, Commander. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'll take care of the prisoners here. You two get some help
and start rounding up the personnel that are still locked down in
quarters. Bring them to Cargo Bay one. <br>
SESKA: We did it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Just like old times. </font></p>

You did a good job today. <br>
TORRES: Thanks. <br>
SESKA: Just make sure you keep it up. <br>
TORRES: What's that supposed to mean? <br>
SESKA: It means I'm not as easy to win over as Chakotay. Come on! Let's
go. <br>
(They take a man from his quarters at gunpoint.) <br>

KES: What are you going to do with us? <br>
SESKA: I said, no talking! <br>
TORRES: Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy. <br>
SESKA: It told you it was a mistake letting Starfleet people in on
this. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Now is not the time, Seska. Take a good look around you.
You're under armed guard. You may also notice that your senior officers
aren't here. They're in the brig. They'll be put off the ship at the
first habitable planet we come to. All except Janeway and Paris, who
will arrive at their rendezvous coordinates to find that Voyager's not
there. In short, I've taken control of the ship. I don't blame any of
you for the mistakes of your leaders, so I'm giving you a choice. You
can be put off the ship with your superiors or you can do what Neelix
and some of your other crew members have already done and join me. If
you do, you'll be part of a crew that's going to do whatever it takes
to get us home as fast as possible. Under my command, we won't let
almighty Federation principles get in the way of opportunities the way
Janeway did when she destroyed the array that could have gotten us
home. And we won't be wasting precious time stopping to investigate
every insignificant anomaly that we come across. What we will do is use
any means necessary to acquire technology that can shorten our journey.
To hell with Starfleet regulations. You have
fifteen minutes to make up your minds. <br>
PARIS: B'Elanna, what's going on here? <br>
TORRES: Computer, freeze programme. Are you in the habit of just
walking in on people's private holodeck time? <br>
PARIS: Well, it's not as if I caught you dancing the rumba with a naked
Bolian. We had a lunch date, remember? <br>
TORRES: Is it lunch time already? I must have lost track of the time. <br>
PARIS: Well, I expected to find you shooting pool at Sandrine's, not
hanging out with Seska. What sort of programme is this anyway? <br>
TORRES: It's really something. I was doing a routine purge of the
database, you know, taking out old files that were taking up space, and
I found this holonovel. It's a kind of 'what if' story, all about a
Maquis mutiny. It's completely compelling and believable. I guess it's
because it's all about us. <br>
PARIS: Who wrote it? <br>
TORRES: Now, that is the big mystery. Whoever the author is has gone to
a lot of trouble to keep his identity a secret. It's been encrypted. <br>
PARIS: Why do you suppose someone would try so hard to be anonymous? <br>
TORRES: Well, think about it. Whoever plays this programme takes on the
role of a Starfleet security officer who gets approached by Chakotay to
help the Maquis take over the ship. I mean, it's pretty inflammatory. <br>
PARIS: You think we should tell the Captain? <br>
TORRES: Probably. <br>
PARIS: It would be pretty hard for us to give her a full report if we
don't know how the story ends. <br>
TORRES: Excellent point. <br>
PARIS: Great. Can you reset it for me? <br>
TORRES: You? I was just getting to the good part. <br>
PARIS: Oh, come on, B'Elanna. Be a sport. I've got to be back on duty
in less than an hour. Besides, isn't half the fun of a holonovel having
someone to talk it over with? <br>
TORRES: All right. You owe me one. </font></p>

lubricate the warp plasma manifolds. <br>

beginning. It's much more fun. <br>

me, and the programme reset. Next time, I'm going to pretend to go

room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Well, if that takes care of our official agenda, there's another matter
I'd like to discuss. Commander Chakotay informs me there's a new
holonovel that's become quite popular among the crew. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's been accessed forty seven times by thirty three
different crew members. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't suppose anyone here is familiar with what we're
talking about? <br>
TORRES: Er, actually, er, Captain, I'm the one who found it on the
auxiliary database. <br>
PARIS: I've been running it too. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Anybody else? <br>
JANEWAY: I understand that the author of this little opus has chosen to
remain anonymous. Perhaps because of the controversial nature of the
story, which depicts Commander Chakotay as the leader of a Maquis
mutiny. Well, now that the cat's out of the bag, I want each of you to
talk to your staff and find out who our anonymous author is. <br>
TUVOK: That won't be necessary, Captain. I am the author of the
programme in question. <br>
PARIS: You, Tuvok? <br>
JANEWAY: I never knew you had literary aspirations. <br>
NEELIX: Not to mention talent. What a story! <br>
TUVOK: I'm afraid there's been a misunderstanding. The programme is not
a holonovel. It is a tactical training scenario. When you first invited
the Maquis to join our crew, I believed that mutiny was a very real
possibility. With that in mind, I began to write a training programme
for junior security officers to prepare them for such an eventuality. <br>
PARIS: But you never finished it? <br>
TUVOK: No. As the two crews began to work together, I concluded that
the threat of an insurrection was increasingly unlikely. I realised the
programme itself might exacerbate the very conflict I sought to avoid.
Therefore, I deleted the scenario, or so I believed. <br>
JANEWAY: Apparently you didn't account for B'Elanna's exceptional
computer skills. <br>
TUVOK: Nor her somewhat excessive curiosity. I apologise for my
carelessness, Captain. <br>
PARIS: Forget your carelessness. What you should be apologising for is
leaving us all hanging by a thread. You've got to finish the story. <br>
TUVOK: On the contrary, Mister Paris. The programme has the potential
to incite animosity among the crew and must be permanently deleted. I
have no doubt the captain concurs. <br>
JANEWAY: With all due respect, Mister Tuvok, loosen up. You may have
intended this programme to be a tactical training tool, but it looks to
me like it's turned into a bit of harmless fun. <br>
TUVOK: As the Captain of this ship, surely you <br>
JANEWAY: I'm more than just a Captain. I'm the leader of a community,
and communities need entertainment, culture, creative outlets. Since
we're not exactly privy to every new piece of music or holonovel that's
written back home, I think it's only natural that we should start
creating our own. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Besides, Tuvok, if the crew doesn't get an ending, you may
have a real mutiny on your hands. <br>
PARIS: If Tuvok doesn't want to finish the story, I volunteer. <br>
TORRES: Oh? <br>
PARIS: Well, I've always wanted to write a holonovel. I think I could
make it pretty exciting. <br>
JANEWAY: Good. Then it's settled. I for one can't wait to see if
Captain Janeway manages to outwit the conspirators. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Mess
hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
Well, if it isn't Mister Anonymous. Come to check up on your
replacement? <br>
TUVOK: Since the captain insists on allowing you to proceed with this
frivolous exercise, I thought you might benefit from the original
probability studies I conducted before beginning the scenario. <br>
PARIS: Well, thanks, Tuvok, but I don't need any probability studies.
I'm just sort of making it up as I go along. <br>
TUVOK: Indeed. I'd be curious to know what you've made up thus far. <br>
PARIS: Well, I was thinking, Paris and Janeway retake the ship, and
then she decides to execute all the conspirators. <br>
TUVOK: That is an entirely implausible plot development. Captain
Janeway would never behave in such an inhumane manner. <br>
PARIS: This isn't real life, Tuvok. It's fiction. Don't get so caught
up in logic. <br>
TUVOK: Logic is an integral part of narrative structure. According to
the Dictates of Poetics by T'hain of Vulcan, a character's actions must
flow inexorably from his or her established traits. <br>
PARIS: Well, I don't know anything about T'hain, but I do know what
makes an interesting story, and that's unexpected plot twists. <br>
TUVOK: If you think I will allow you to turn this programme into a
parody, you are sorely mistaken. <br>
PARIS: Are you saying that you're going to finish it yourself? <br>
TORRES: Artistic differences? <br>
TUVOK: I would hardly call Mister Paris's ideas artistic. <br>
PARIS: Apparently, my instincts don't comply with the Vulcan Dictates
of Poetics. <br>
TORRES: Well, I've got a couple of suggestions that might help. Now, up
until now the story's been nothing but action, which is fine. But what
it needs is a little heart, a little emotion. <br>
TUVOK: We are not writing a romance novel, Lieutenant. <br>
PARIS: We? <br>
TUVOK: I've decided that your efforts would benefit from my
collaboration. <br>
PARIS: Oh, really? <br>
TORRES: Listen, I don't care which one of you is writing this thing.
All I'm saying is that there is room in every good story for a little
bit of passion. <br>
PARIS: You know, maybe you're on to something. I could add a steamy
love scene between the Starfleet conn officer and the Maquis engineer. <br>
TORRES: Oh, that's realistic. <br>
NEELIX: How about a fresh pot of coffee to keep those creative juices
flowing, eh? <br>
PARIS: Thanks, Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: While I'm here. <br>
PARIS: Let me guess. You have a suggestion to make. <br>
NEELIX: Of course not. I would never presume to interfere in the
creative process. It's more of a comment, really, about the Neelix
character. <br>
TUVOK: How surprising. <br>
JANEWAY: He would never betray the Captain the way he does in that
story. No offence, Mister Vulcan, but I don't think you understand my
character very well. <br>
PARIS: Tuvok, did you forget to follow the Dictates of Poetics? <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps we should find someplace quieter to work. <br>
PARIS: Now, that's the first intelligent suggestion I've heard all
evening. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TUVOK: I
believe our first step should be to create a carefully constructed
outline of the remaining chapters. <br>
PARIS: I told you, Tuvok. I'm just making it up as I go. <br>
TUVOK: We cannot proceed without a carefully constructed outline. <br>
PARIS: There you go with that we stuff again. I don't remember agreeing
to let you help me. <br>
TUVOK: Need I remind you that it was I who first began the scenario? <br>
PARIS: And you think I'm compromising your creative vision? <br>
TUVOK: In so many words, yes. And it is my duty to ensure that ship
security is not compromised by your creative vision. <br>
PARIS: You had your chance to finish the story, and you wanted to
delete it. <br>
TUVOK: True, but since that is no longer an option, I am now exercising
my prerogative as the original author. <br>
PARIS: Look, Tuvok, for the last time, I don't need any help. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Holodeck]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: Ah,
there you are. I have several brilliant ideas for upcoming chapters of
your holonovel, as well as a list of revisions and dialogue changes
that I believe will improve the earlier installments. <br>
PARIS: I don't believe this. <br>
EMH: No thanks are necessary. In addition, I'm prepared to offer my
expertise in the creation of holographic mise-en-scene. <br>
TUVOK: Computer, override the EMH program's autonomous controls and
transfer him back to Sickbay. <br>
EMH: Now, wait just a min <br>
(The EMH disappears.) <br>
PARIS: Thanks, Tuvok. Now that I think about it, I'll take it from
here. <br>
TUVOK: You may find that difficult, since I am the only one who can
make additions to the programme. <br>
PARIS: All right, Tuvok. You win. We'll finish the story together. <br>
TUVOK: That is a very rational decision, Mister Paris. Computer,
reinitiate the holographic programme entitled Insurrection Alpha,
security clearance Tuvok four seven seven four. <br>
COMPUTER: The programme has been reinitiated. <br>
PARIS: The first thing we're going to change is that title. <br>
TUVOK: Reformat the holo-matrix for the addition of new interactive
algorithms. <br>
COMPUTER: The holo-matrix has been formatted. <br>
TUVOK: Reopen the narrative parameters file. <br>
(The holodeck glitches.)

Captain, we just lost power in both transporter rooms. The com went
down, and the holodeck systems are completely scrambled. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
What are we doing in the brig? <br>
TUVOK: I have no idea. We haven't given the computer instructions to
create a location yet. <br>
HOLO-SESKA: Hello, Tuvok. I've been expecting you. If you can see me,
you've obviously reopened the narrative parameters file of the tactical
scenario you've been working on. <br>
TUVOK: How do you know that? You're a hologram. <br>
HOLO-SESKA: That's right. A holographic representation of Seska, one of
the Maquis shipmates you betrayed. I would have thought all that time
you spent spying on us might have given you a little more insight into
the Maquis, but after looking over what you've already written, I can
see you need a little help. So I've created this representation of
myself, to guide you through the rest of the programme. <br>
TUVOK: There is no more programme. <br>
HOLO-SESKA: There is now. I finished writing it for you, with a few
revisions of my own. <br>
PARIS: Revisions? <br>
HOLO-SESKA: To start with, the holodeck is now sealed. Your friends
will find it very difficult to get you out of here. And the safety
protocols are off, which means if I shoot you, and I am going to shoot
you, you'll die. But not just yet. You've got ten seconds to run. Nine,
eight <br>
TUVOK: Computer, end programme. <br>
HOLO-SESKA: Seven, six, five <br>
TUVOK: Holodeck one to Bridge. Emergency transport. <br>
HOLO-SESKA: Oh, did I forget to tell you? The moment you restarted the
programme, the com system went down. Four, three <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
You should never have crossed her, Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: She has been dead for over a year now. There would have been no
way to predict this turn of events. <br>
PARIS: I guess we should have known Seska wouldn't let a little thing
like death stop her from getting even. <br>
HOLO-JANEWAY: Tuvok. Tom. In here. <br>
PARIS: Captain? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Holographic

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">HOLO-JANEWAY:
We're going to have to transport to the cargo bay to free the rest of
the prisoners. It's safer than trying to make it on foot. <br>
PARIS: She's a hologram too? <br>
TUVOK: Apparently she believes we're here to help her retake the ship
from the mutineers. <br>
PARIS: I say we play along. We could use all the help we can get
against Seska. <br>
TUVOK: You're forgetting it was Seska who rewrote the scenario. For all
we know, she's programmed Captain Janeway to betray us. <br>
PARIS: I suppose you have a better idea? <br>
TUVOK: The safest course of action is to avoid participation of any
kind. Eventually, the real Captain will discover our predicament and
shut down the programme from the outside. <br>
HOLO-JANEWAY: Let's move! <br>
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Hold it right there! <br>
HOLO-JANEWAY: Back off! <br>
HOLO-SESKA: Or what? You'll shoot us? Go right ahead. <br>
HOLO-JANEWAY: Whatever you say. <br>
(Janeway fires her phaser rifle, but it backfires and kills her.) <br>
HOLO-SESKA: Poor Kathryn. I guess nobody told her the phaser rifles
from storage locker three have been malfunctioning. <br>
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: You're an incredible woman, Seska. <br>
(Holo-Chakotay kisses Seska.) <br>
HOLO-SESKA: You see who's in charge now, don't you? So if I were you,
I'd get moving again. The programme's not over. <br>
TUVOK: We have no intention of participating in this exercise. <br>
HOLO-SESKA: You don't want to end up like your Captain, do you? <br>
PARIS: You programmed all this. The malfunctioning phaser, the version
of Chakotay who's attracted to you. None of it's real. <br>
HOLO-SESKA: You hear that? He thinks this is a game. Show him he's
wrong. <br>
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: I've been waiting a long time for this. <br>
(Holo-Chakotay shoots Paris in the arm.) <br>
HOLO-SESKA: Next time, you'll believe me when I tell you the safety
protocols are off. Now, you've got five seconds to start running again,
or you'll end up with more than a flesh wound. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
So much for not playing along with Seska's programme. <br>
TUVOK: Are you able to continue? <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:

your wound. Besides, it's as good a place as any to hide from Seska. <br>
HOLO-EMH: Please state the nature of the medical emergency. <br>
PARIS: No emergency, Doc. I'm fine. <br>
HOLO-EMH: Nonsense. You have second-degree phaser burns. Please have a
seat on biobed one. <br>
PARIS: That's all right, Doc. I'm telling you, I feel fine. <br>
HOLO-EMH: You require treatment. Twenty cc's nitric acid. A little
proverbial salt in the wound. <br>
(Paris screams in pain. Tuvok disarms the EMH, who then hits him and
starts to strangle him.) <br>
HOLO-EMH: You're looking well. <br>
TUVOK: Go! <br>

Are you all right, Mister Paris? <br>
PARIS: Oh, just great. Maybe we can go to the mess hall now and let the
holographic Neelix burn my arm with a frying pan. <br>
TUVOK: Your feeble attempt at wit notwithstanding, it does appear that
Seska has reprogrammed the holographic crew to torture us. I suggest we
avoid meeting any more of them. <br>
HOLO-SESKA [OC]: Seska to Tuvok. I know you can hear me. <br>
PARIS: Oh, terrific. <br>
HOLO-SESKA [OC]: I just wanted to remind you that wherever you go, I'll

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM:
Captain, you're not going to believe this, but Seska caused these
cascade failures. <br>
JANEWAY: Seska? How? <br>
TORRES: What she lacked in loyalty she made up for in ingenuity.
According to the back-up computer logs, she got into Tuvok's scenario
on stardate 48671 about a month before she left the ship. She
programmed it to cause all of these shutdowns the next time Tuvok
reopened the narrative parameters file, which he didn't do until today.
<br>
JANEWAY: Can we get them out? <br>
TORRES: Seska laid booby-trapped subroutines everywhere. If we try to
open the holodeck doors, the power grid is rigged to explode. <br>
KIM: And the transporters are still offline. <br>
JANEWAY: You said the narrative parameters file is open now? <br>
KIM: Seska's revised programme is playing out as we speak. <br>
JANEWAY: If Seska can rewrite Tuvok, maybe I can rewrite Seska. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
So, Tuvok, anything in the Dictates of Poetics about how to escape from
a ship full of insane holograms? <br>
TUVOK: Your attempts at humour are hardly constructive, Mister Paris. <br>
(He unlocks an internal hatch to reveal a plasma fire.) <br>
TUVOK: The controls are jammed. I cannot close the hatch. <br>
(A plasma fire extinguisher appears.) <br>
PARIS: Tuvok! <br>
(Paris puts out the fire.) <br>
PARIS: Where do you suppose this came from? <br>
TUVOK: That is an intriguing question. <br>
PARIS: Do you think Seska's toying with us? Taking us to the brink of
death again, then letting us live so she can keep torturing us? <br>
TUVOK: I prefer a more optimistic interpretation. It is possible our
shipmates outside the holodeck have learned of our predicament and have
found a way to help us by making additions to the programme, such as
that plasma extinguisher. <br>
PARIS: If you want to look on the bright side, I'm certainly not going
to argue with you. <br>
(They go down a ladder.) <br>
PARIS: If they do know what's going on, why just hand us a plasma
extinguisher? Why not shut down the holo-grid, or change the scenario? <br>
TUVOK: I would imagine Seska has made it very difficult for anyone to
implement more than minor changes. <br>
PARIS: Take a look at this. <br>
(On Aux Systems Monitor 128 - TRYING TO HELP YOU. GO TO WEAPONS
