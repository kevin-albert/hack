BASHIR: I don't know about you, but I'm starving. <br>
KIRA: Me, too. <br>
JAKE: Here you go. Enjoy. <br>
KIRA: Thanks. This looks delicious. <br>
(Hotplates are on a table and the chef is at work stirring a bowl full
of, well, green.) <br>
SISKO: Now, Constable, the secret of a good soufflé is consistency. You
have to be careful not to over-whip it. <br>
ODO: I see. <br>
SISKO: I hope I'm not boring you. <br>
ODO: Just because I don't need food, Commander, doesn't mean I'm not
interested in its preparation. I'm fascinated by the humanoid
preoccupation with eating. May I? <br>
(Sisko gives Odo the bowl and whisk while he turns whatever is sizzling
in the pan.) <br>
SISKO: By all means. <br>
(Odo is keeping the whisk still and moving the bowl.) <br>
SISKO: Nice and smooth. That's it, it's all in the wrist. <br>
BASHIR: Where did you learn all this? <br>
SISKO: In my father's restaurant in New Orleans. <br>
KIRA: What are we having? It smells delicious. <br>
JAKE: Blackened redfish with creamed spinach and sautéed beets. <br>
BASHIR: Beets? <br>
SISKO: You don't like beets, Doctor? <br>
BASHIR: Well, they're not exactly a personal favourite of mine. <br>
SISKO: That's because you haven't had them prepared properly. <br>
(Sisko ladles out some baby beetroots.) <br>
SISKO: Beets are a very misunderstood vegetable. <br>
BASHIR: Well, I look forward to understanding it better. <br>
(Doorbell.) <br>
SISKO: Come in. <br>
DAX: Oh, what a day. I just spent the last six hours in one of the
upper pylons trying to get the new sensor relay online. <br>
SISKO: Help yourself to something. Dinner'll be ready in a few minutes.
<br>
DAX: Great, I've been looking forward to this all day. <br>
BASHIR: I hope you like beets. <br>
DAX: I love'em. <br>
SISKO: Keep at it, Constable. Nice, even strokes. <br>
ODO: Do you find something amusing, Major? <br>
KIRA: I just think you look so cute. <br>
(Dax picks up a sort of electronic keyboard.) <br>
DAX: Who's is this? <br>
JAKE: It's mine. <br>
DAX: I didn't know that you played. <br>
JAKE: I don't. I took lessons for a while but I wasn't very good. <br>
DAX: I know the feeling. None of Dax's hosts, even Jadzia, had any
musical ability. <br>
BASHIR: Nobody said life was fair. <br>
DAX: Not even if you've had seven of them. <br>
(Dax plays with the keyboard and eventually comes out with a tune) <br>
DAX: You would think one of us would've been born without a tin ear. <br>
KIRA: Sounds like one of you had some talent, after all. <br>
BASHIR: That's lovely. <br>
DAX: Quiet. (she keeps playing) That's not it. <br>
KIRA: What piece was that? <br>
DAX: I don't know. I don't believe I've ever heard it before. <br>
BASHIR: Maybe you hit on it by accident. You know, beginner's luck. <br>
DAX: But I know it somehow. <br>
KIRA: It's probably something from your childhood. You'll think of it. <br>
JAKE: Dinner is ready.

she's humming her new tune.) <br>
SISKO: Do you mind? <br>
DAX: What? <br>
SISKO: Your humming. It's a little distracting. <br>
DAX: Sorry, I didn't realise I was doing it. <br>
SISKO: You've been humming that same tune since we started the game. <br>
DAX: I guess I just can't get it out of my mind. <br>
SISKO: Do me a favour. Try. <br>
(Sisko makes his move.) <br>
SISKO: Your turn. <br>
(She takes the pawn.) <br>
SISKO: You sure you want to do that? <br>
DAX: Your move. <br>
SISKO: Check. <br>
DAX: Where did that knight come from? <br>
SISKO: Your mind is not on the game. <br>
DAX: Oh, so you decided to made an illegal move to get my attention? <br>
SISKO: Of course not. And it's a legal move. You know, why don't we
just call it a day. You obviously have other things on your mind. <br>
DAX: Curzon always suspected you were a cheat. <br>
SISKO: Is this some kind of joke? <br>
DAX: Don't play innocent with me, Benjamin. We both know you're trying
to cheat me here, so why don't you just admit it? <br>
(She scatters the pieces and leaves)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: Dax? <br>
DAX: Did Sisko send you to apologise for him? <br>
KIRA: No. But he was concerned about what happened. I thought you might
like to talk about it. <br>
DAX: There's nothing to talk about. <br>
KIRA: You can't really think he tried to cheat you? <br>
DAX: I knew you'd take his side. <br>
KIRA: I'm not taking anybody's side. <br>
DAX: In that case I think you should leave, Kira. <br>
KIRA: Dax. <br>
DAX: I'm serious. Leave. Fine. I'll go. <br>
KIRA: Wait. <br>

and the tune starts up. The Promenade is empty and a masked figure
stands on the upper level. Dax looks around, and the figure is gone.

reveal another one. Dax turn and the figure is in front of her,

SISKO: How do you feel? <br>
DAX: I feel like an idiot. I'm so sorry about all the horrible things I
said to you. <br>
SISKO: Don't worry about it. They're already forgotten. And I used to
think Curzon had a temper. <br>
DAX: I don't know what's wrong with me. I feel like I have so much
anger inside and I don't know where it's coming from. <br>
SISKO: This masked figure in your <br>
DAX: Hallucinations? <br>
SISKO: Do you have the sense of who it might've been? <br>
DAX: That's what's so strange. He seems familiar somehow but I don't
know from where. And the music. Benjamin, I have to find out what that
music is. <br>
SISKO: Why don't you input as much as you can remember in the computer.
It might be able to find a match in the Federation database. <br>
DAX: I'll do it. Well, as soon as Julian lets me leave here. <br>
BASHIR: Jadzia, have you experienced any hallucinations prior to this? <br>
DAX: Never. And I hope I never do again. It was terrifying. <br>
BASHIR: Have any of Dax's other hosts? <br>
DAX: No. Believe me, I'd remember. <br>
BASHIR: Well, according to your file, the only major trauma the Dax
symbiont ever suffered was when Torias Dax was injured in a shuttle
accident. <br>
SISKO: Torias. He was Dax's fifth host, wasn't he? <br>
DAX: Yes, right before Curzon. <br>
BASHIR: It says here that Torias remained in a comatose state for just
under six months. There must've been a lot of tissue damage. The
doctors couldn't keep his isoboramine levels up. <br>
SISKO: Isoboramine? <br>
DAX: It's a neurotransmitter that mediates the synaptic functions
between the host and the symbiont. <br>
BASHIR: When the levels dropped to below forty percent of normal they
had to remove the symbiont. <br>
DAX: Sometimes the host is sacrificed to save the symbiont. Are you
checking my isoboramine levels? <br>
BASHIR: Yes. <br>
DAX: How low are they? <br>
BASHIR: They've fallen to seventy three percent of normal. <br>
SISKO: Do you have any idea what's causing it? <br>
BASHIR: I'm not sure. There's no tissue damage, no synaptic
degradation. <br>
DAX: Julian, am I in danger of rejecting my symbiont? <br>
BASHIR: I wouldn't worry about rejection just yet, but we do have to
get your isoboramine levels back up. And I suggest we take her back to
the Trill homeworld and have the doctors at the Symbiosis Commission
examine her. <br>
SISKO: Curzon always said he wanted to show me the Trill homeworld.
Looks like I'm going to get there after all.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: How long before we reach Trill? <br>
SISKO: A little over thirty seven hours. How's Dax? <br>
BASHIR: Resting in her quarters. <br>
SISKO: It's funny. It's been almost four years since Curzon died, and I
still miss the old man. At first I never thought I'd ever get used to a
new Dax, but if anything happens to Jadzia <br>
BASHIR: I know. I feel the same way. We'll just have to make sure
nothing happens to her. Right? <br>
SISKO: Right.

BASHIR: Yes? <br>
DAX: Oh, good. I didn't wake you. <br>
BASHIR: Not at all. You're having trouble sleeping? <br>
DAX: Yeah, a little. <br>
BASHIR: I could get you something. <br>
DAX: No, thanks, but I could use some company, if you're not too busy. <br>
BASHIR: Oh, no, no, no, no. I was just reading. <br>
DAX: Oh, anything I'd be interested in? (takes the PADD) Trill
physiology. <br>
BASHIR: Just some background research. Look, Jadzia, I know you're
worried, but the doctors at the Symbiosis Commission know a lot more
about this than I do. <br>
DAX: I can't believe I'm going back there. I spent three years as a
Trill Initiate, and in all that time I hardly ever left the complex.
After I was joined I swore I would never set foot in there again. <br>
BASHIR: Was it really that bad? <br>
DAX: No. What I remember is the endless series of tests they put me
through. <br>
BASHIR: Considering the risk of rejection, you can't really blame them.
If they were to put a symbiont to an unsuitable host, they'd both be
dead in a matter of days. <br>
DAX: That's true. I guess I had such a difficult time because I put so
much pressure on myself. I wanted to be joined so badly. <br>
BASHIR: Well, look on the bright side. At least this time you won't be
going there as an Initiate. <br>
DAX: No, I'm going there as a patient, and that's much worse. I never
told you this before, Julian, but I've always been afraid of doctors. <br>
BASHIR: Most people are. When I was younger I was terrified of them. <br>
DAX: Really? <br>
BASHIR: They seemed to know everything. It was as if they held the
power of life and death in their hands. I used to think that if I
didn't behave, they'd make sure I got sick. Then as I got older, I
decided that I wanted to know what they knew, be as smart as they were.
<br>
DAX: And that's why you went to medical school? <br>
BASHIR: That's right. And you know what I learned there? That all I
really wanted to do was help people. That's what doctors are there for,
to help. So there's really no reason to be afraid of them. Now if that
little story didn't put you to sleep, I don't know what will. <br>
DAX: You're a very dear man, Julian. <br>
BASHIR: Listen, Jadzia, you're welcome to stay the night here if you
want. You can have the top bunk. <br>
DAX: Are you sure you don't mind? <br>
BASHIR: Absolutely not. Up you go. <br>
DAX: Okay, well, in that case, if it's not too much trouble, would you
mind if I took the lower bunk? Curzon fell out of a tree once, and <br>
BASHIR: Whatever you want. <br>
DAX: Thank you. <br>

DAX: After they finally finished the neural response analysis, another
doctor came in and ran a cortical protein series. <br>
BASHIR: Did they do a bio-spectral scan on the symbiont? <br>
DAX: They had to make an incision so they could insert the scanner. <br>
(A woman enters.) <br>
RENHOL: Jadzia, it's good to see you again. <br>
DAX: Doctor Renhol. <br>
RENHOL: Everyone's very excited about your being here, you know. Jadzia
is the only Initiate to ever successfully reapply to the programme
after being dropped. You must be Doctor Bashir. <br>
BASHIR: That's right. <br>
SISKO: Commander Benjamin Sisko. <br>
RENHOL: Ah, yes. Curzon's friend. <br>
SISKO: Yes, I had that privilege. <br>
BASHIR: Did you get a chance to look over the test results? <br>
RENHOL: Yes, I did. As you noted, Doctor, her isoboramine levels are
low so I've put her on a benzocyatic regimen to compensate. As you can
see, there's already a three percent improvement. <br>
DAX: Will I have to stay here for the duration of the treatment? <br>
RENHOL: No, Doctor Bashir can administer it. But I would like to see
you back here tomorrow for a follow up, and for lunch. <br>
DAX: I'd like that. <br>
RENHOL: Well, if you'll excuse me I have an Initiate who needs some
hand-holding.

hallucination. I've checked her isoboramine levels. They've risen
another six percent. <br>
RENHOL: That's a larger increase than I'd anticipated. The suddenness
could be what triggered the hallucination. I want you to start
administering more frequent treatments at a lower dosage. <br>
DAX: Doctor, the people who attacked me, they were from the Symbiosis
Commission. <br>
RENHOL: Hallucinations often take the form of latent anxieties, and we
all know the time you spent here wasn't that easy for you. <br>
DAX: But the uniforms they were wearing, they were from over a hundred
years ago. <br>
SISKO: That was long before Jadzia was an Initiate. <br>
DAX: And none of my other hosts had bad memories of being here. <br>

everything's not perfect. You don't want them cranky. <br>

understand it. A decrease that severe is usually the result of tissue
damage. Commander, this wormhole you've discovered. Have your people
done any surveys of the diametric fields it generates? <br>
SISKO: Yes. In fact Dax did the most recent survey herself. <br>
RENHOL: I'd like to see those reports. <br>
BASHIR: Do you think there's any correlation between Dax's condition

RENHOL: Something unusual is affecting her and at this point we can't
afford to rule anything out. If we can't get her isoboramine readings
up to an acceptable level within forty eight hours, I'm afraid we'll
have to remove the symbiont. <br>

Belar's picture. <br>
SISKO: I think it's time we found out more about him.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: I've accessed the Trill central database.
Let's see what information there is on Joran Belar. Here we are. Born
on stardate 1024.7, died on 8615.2. <br>
SISKO: Is that all there is? <br>
BASHIR: I was expecting a lot more. When I looked through Dax's records
there was detailed information on each host. <br>
SISKO: Could the file have been purged? <br>
BASHIR: If part of the file's been deleted, the data compression ratio
might be off. Yes, look at this. The ratio's for a file five times
larger. There was definitely more information here. <br>
SISKO: Call up Dax's records. Put them side by side with Joran's. Wait
a minute. Look at these dates. <br>
BASHIR: Belar died on the same day as Torias Dax died. <br>
SISKO: The same day the Dax symbiont was put into Curzon. <br>
BASHIR: Oh, this has to be more than a coincidence. <br>
SISKO: Whoever purged the main database might have missed something.
Check the enrollment records of all the Trill music academies during
Belar's lifetime. <br>
(A list of names I can hardly read but does include Bell, Pacific and
probably other jokes too.) <br>
BASHIR: He's not listed but there is someone here with the same last
name. Maybe they're related? <br>
SISKO: Yolad Belar. Check the central database. See if he's still
alive. <br>
BASHIR: He is. <br>
SISKO: Access the Trill communications grid. Try to locate him. <br>
BASHIR: There's a reasonable chance that he and Joran were related.
Musical ability often runs in families. I've established a comm.-link. <br>
SISKO: Put him on the main viewer. <br>
YOLAD [on viewscreen]: Yes, can I help you? <br>
SISKO: I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko of the Federation Starbase Deep
Space Nine. <br>
YOLAD [on viewscreen]: What would a Starfleet officer want with me? <br>
SISKO: Are you Yolad Belar? <br>
YOLAD [on viewscreen]: I am. Why? <br>
SISKO: We're trying to find information about a man named Joran Belar.
Did you know him? <br>
YOLAD [on viewscreen]: Of course I did. He was my brother. <br>
SISKO: He was a composer? <br>
YOLAD [on viewscreen]: That's right. We both graduated from the same
music academy. <br>
SISKO: Are you aware that his record has been purged from the Academy's
files? <br>
YOLAD [on viewscreen]: That doesn't make any sense. What's all this
about? <br>
SISKO: That's what we're trying to find out. Do you know if your
brother knew a joined Trill named Torias Dax? <br>
YOLAD [on viewscreen]: My brother died eighty five years ago. I have a
hard time remembering what happened yesterday. <br>
BASHIR: Then you don't remember the name? <br>
YOLAD [on viewscreen]: No, but that doesn't mean Joran didn't know him.
You said he was joined? They could've met when my brother went off to
become an Initiate. <br>
SISKO: He was a candidate for joining? <br>
YOLAD [on viewscreen]: That's what I just said, isn't it? <br>
SISKO: Was he given a symbiont? <br>
YOLAD [on viewscreen]: Not according to the Symbiosis Commission. They
claim he was dropped from the programme after the second year.
According to them he murdered the doctor that recommended dropping him,
and was killed trying to escape the murder scene. <br>
SISKO: It sounds like you're not convinced that's what really happened.
<br>
YOLAD [on viewscreen]: Oh, I believe he killed that doctor. My brother
had a violent temper. But about six months before that happened my
brother contacted me. He sounded different somehow, more confident,
even colder than usual. And when I asked him about it he laughed. He
said me he was different, that he'd been Joined. <br>
SISKO: Did he tell you the name of his symbiont? <br>
YOLAD [on viewscreen]: Maybe he did. I was so surprised to learn he'd
been chosen to be Joined I can't remember much else. I loved my
brother, Commander. In spite of all the things he did, I loved him. <br>
SISKO: Thank you for taking the time to speak with us. <br>
(Transmission ends.) <br>
SISKO: Doctor, call up Dax's records. I think I'm beginning to
understand what's going on here. According to the official records,
after Torias died the Dax symbiont was put into Curzon. What if that's
not what happened? What if Dax was given another host before Curzon. A
host who should never have been given a symbiont. <br>
BASHIR: A host named Joran Belar.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Dax's room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RENHOL: Her isoboramine levels have dropped to
forty four percent. Tell Doctor Torvin to prepare the new host for
surgery. We'll begin transferring the symbiont in fifteen minutes. <br>
(The nurse goes to leave as Sisko and Bashir enter.) <br>
SISKO: Tell Doctor Torvin to get himself a cup of raktajino. He won't
be needed. <br>
RENHOL: Commander Sisko, how dare you come in here and <br>
BASHIR: It's over, Doctor. We know about Joran Belar. <br>
RENHOL: Wait outside. Tell the surgeons to stand by. <br>
(The nurse leaves.) <br>
RENHOL: I don't have time for this, Commander. The symbiont is in
danger. <br>
SISKO: So is Jadzia. <br>
RENHOL: I can't do anything for her. <br>
SISKO: Can't? Or won't? <br>
RENHOL: I resent that implication. <br>
SISKO: And I resent having to watch my friend die just so you can
protect your secret. <br>
RENHOL: What secret? <br>
SISKO: Oh, I think you know. And the thought of it becoming public
scares the hell out of you. <br>
RENHOL: Commander, I don't know what you're talking about. <br>
SISKO: I'm talking about the fact that eighty six years ago the
Symbiosis Commission mistakenly gave the Dax symbiont to Joran Belar. <br>
RENHOL: I don't recall ever seeing any mention of a Joran Dax on our
records. <br>
SISKO: And we both know why, Doctor. The Symbiosis Commission altered
the records, just like they tried to erase all knowledge of Joran from
Dax's memory. <br>
BASHIR: And now after eighty years the memory block is deteriorating
and Dax is starting to remember the Joran host. <br>
RENHOL: What possible reason would anyone have to create that sort of
elaborate cover up? <br>
SISKO: We wondered about that too. What was it about Joran that had to
be hidden at all costs? The fact that he never should have been
selected as a host? No, that simple error in judgement wouldn't be
enough, would it? There had to be something more, something that would
shake the very foundation of your society. <br>
BASHIR: Tell me, Doctor, how many of your people are suitable for
Joining? <br>
RENHOL: I don't see how that's relevant. <br>
BASHIR: I understand the percentage is very low. Maybe one in a
thousand? <br>
RENHOL: That's right. <br>
BASHIR: Which is why the candidates are put through such rigorous
testing. <br>
RENHOL: That's how we make sure the symbionts aren't given to an
unsuitable host. <br>
BASHIR: What would happen if for some reason a symbiont was given to an
unsuitable host? <br>
RENHOL: That doesn't happen. <br>
BASHIR: But what if it did? <br>
RENHOL: Rejection would set in. The host and symbiont would both die. <br>
BASHIR: How long before rejection would set in? <br>
RENHOL: Three, maybe four days. <br>
BASHIR: Then someone like Joran Belar, an unstable personality with
violent tendencies, should have rejected a symbiont within a matter of
days. Yet that didn't happen, did it? According to our information, he
was Joined to the Dax symbiont for six months. <br>
SISKO: Six months, Doctor. If a man like Joran Belar can be Joined
successfully for that long, how many others can be joined as well?
Hundreds, thousands? Certainly more than the Symbiosis Commission would
have us believe. And that is what you've been trying to cover up all
along, isn't it? That's why you're willing to let Jadzia die. I'm not
interested
in exposing your secret, Doctor. All I care about is Jadzia. And I
promise you, if she dies, I will see to it that the entire planet knows
why. <br>
RENHOL: Do you realise what would happen if you did that? It would mean
chaos. There aren't enough symbionts for that many hosts. The potential
danger to the symbionts would be enormous. They would become
commodities to be purchased or prizes to be fought over. Nearly half
our population is capable of being Joined. That's what we learned from
our unfortunate experience with Joran Dax. Now do you understand why
you must not reveal the truth? <br>
SISKO: Do you understand my terms? <br>
RENHOL: It's not that simple. For Jadzia to survive, we have to
stabilise the synaptic functions between the host and symbiont. Joran's
memories have to be allowed to surface, to re-integrated with Dax's
other memories. It could be very dangerous. <br>
SISKO: Jadzia is a strong woman. I say we give her that chance. <br>
RENHOL: What if you're wrong? What if Joran's personality overwhelms
Jadzia? Are you willing to risk that? <br>
SISKO: The point is. it's not up to me or you to decide. It's her life
and her decision. <br>
(Renhol wakes Dax.) <br>
DAX: Julian. <br>
BASHIR: We've got a lot to talk about, Jadzia. You have a decision to
make. </font></p>

DAX: Joran. <br>
JORAN: You know who I am. <br>
DAX: You're a part of me. <br>

SISKO: Just thought I'd see how you were doing. <br>
DAX: Julian stopped by fifteen minutes ago and said the same thing.
I'll be all right. I just need some time to sort things out. <br>
SISKO: I suppose it would have been easier if you'd never found out
about Joran. <br>
DAX: No, I'm glad I did. If you want to know who you are, it's
important to know who you've been. <br>
SISKO: Good night, old man. <br>
DAX: Benjamin, I'll see you in the morning. <br>
