Mister Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: Sorry. How about a game of Species, Starship or Anomaly? <br>
TUVOK: Surely you could find something more productive to occupy your
time. <br>
NEELIX: Come on, Tuvok, it'll be fun. You think of something, species,
anomaly, or starship, and I have fifteen questions to guess what it is.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.<br>
TUVOK: I would prefer some peace and quiet. <br>
NEELIX: How about a riddle? <br>
TUVOK: Mister Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: Come on, it'll be fun. <br>
TUVOK: I have no desire for fun. <br>
NEELIX: Okay, forget fun. A good riddle can stimulate the mind. Now, no
self-respecting Vulcan could say no to that. <br>
TUVOK: Very well. One riddle. <br>
NEELIX: Okay, here goes. A lone Ensign finds himself stranded on a
class L planetoid with no rations. His only possession, a calendar.
When Starfleet finds him twelve months later, he's in perfect health.
Why didn't he starve to death? <br>
TUVOK: It is a theoretical possibility that such planetoids contain hot
water springs, which could sustain the man for several weeks. <br>
NEELIX: But not for a whole year. <br>
TUVOK: I concur. Logic dictates that the Ensign in question would
perish. <br>
NEELIX: Ah ha, ha ha! I stumped you. As a matter of fact, he not only
survived, but his belly was full. Why? Because he feasted on dates from
the calendar. <br>
TUVOK: Your answer is merely wordplay, it has no basis in reality. Now,
if you'll excuse me. <br>
NEELIX: Where are you going? <br>
TUVOK: To find some peace and quiet. <br>
NEELIX: Have fun.

Report. <br>
EMH: He's in neuraleptic shock. I'll need another twenty milligrams of
synaptizine. <br>
NEELIX: I'll get it. <br>
EMH: It's not working. I'll need to try direct cortical stimulation.
Initiate a neurostatic pulse on my mark. <br>
JANEWAY: Right. <br>
EMH: Now. Again. <br>(Tuvok stops twitching.)<br>EMH: His vital signs have stabilised, for the moment
anyway, But he suffered severe neurological trauma. <br>
JANEWAY: Do you know what caused it? <br>
EMH: Some kind of alien weapon. <br>
NEELIX: By the time I reached Tuvok, whoever had attacked him was gone. <br>
JANEWAY: What about the surrounding space? Any indication of cloaked
vessels? <br>
NEELIX: Between trying to tend to the Commander and piloting the Flyer,
I had my hands full. I, I didn't think to scan for cloaked ships. I'm
sorry. <br>
JANEWAY: You saved Tuvok's life, Neelix. You have nothing to be sorry
about. How do you plan to treat him? <br>
EMH: I won't know until I've run a series of neurological scans, but it
would certainly help to know something about the weapon. <br>
JANEWAY: Neelix, these Kesat you were negotiating with. Any reason to
believe they might know something about this? <br>
NEELIX: It couldn't hurt to ask. <br>
JANEWAY: Time to reopen diplomatic channels. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Briefing
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">NAROQ:
Deputy investigator Naroq, Kesat security. Captain Janeway, Commander
Chakotay, Ambassador Neelix. <br>
JANEWAY: You've done your homework. <br>
NAROQ: I familiarised myself with the facts on the way here. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We're hoping you can help us shed some light on what happened
to our crewman. <br>
NAROQ: I believe I can. Based on the information you provided, it is my
opinion that he was a victim of the Ba'Neth. <br>
JANEWAY: I've never heard of them. <br>
NAROQ: I'm not surprised. In my language, their name means shadow
people. They're a species obsessed with concealing their identity.
Extremely paranoid and xenophobic. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, that explains their cloaking technology. <br>
NAROQ: It's my belief they've been responsible for several unexplained
attacks similar to this one. <br>
NEELIX: Why wasn't I warned about them during my negotiations with your
government? <br>
NAROQ: Because my government's official position is that the Ba'Neth do
not exist. Most people think they're a myth. <br>
CHAKOTAY: There's nothing mythical about what happened to Mister Tuvok.
Why is your government so sceptical? <br>
NAROQ: Because there've been so few encounters with the Ba'Neth and,
well, no one's ever actually seen one. <br>
JANEWAY: How many encounters are we talking about, exactly? <br>
NAROQ: Before this incident? Twelve. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I guess we're lucky thirteen. <br>
NAROQ: You're lucky I gave my supervisor two bottles of Kesatian ale to
get this assignment. Any other inspector would have simply attributed
Commander Tuvok's injuries to unexplained phenomenon. <br>
JANEWAY: No offence, Mister Naroq, but what makes you so sure the
Ba'Neth aren't just a myth? <br>
NAROQ: This incident fits the pattern, Captain. All of the alleged
encounters have occurred aboard vessels foreign to this sector. I
believe they've been attempts by the Ba'Neth to assess the technology
of new arrivals. <br>
NEELIX: They were trying to download tactical data. <br>
NAROQ: And Commander Tuvok suffered severe neural damage. That's also
consistent with previous attacks. The Ba'Neth were making sure he would
not tell anyone what he saw. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe that's why Tuvok's tricorder was destroyed. They didn't
want us to see the cloaking frequency he'd found. <br>
NAROQ: He found a cloaking frequency? <br>
JANEWAY: Apparently. <br>
NAROQ: Captain, I don't blame you for finding my theories a bit
eccentric. I'm used to it. It's why I'm still a deputy investigator,
but I've brought equipment to help your investigation. Let me examine
Commander Tuvok and run scans on the vessel where he was attacked. I
may finally be able to prove my theories. <br>
JANEWAY: With all due respect, we're more interested in saving Tuvok's
life. <br>
NAROQ: If we work together, maybe we can do both. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: His
cognitive, memory and logic centres have all been severely damaged. <br>
NAROQ: But he still has brain activity, which is more than I can say
for any of the previous victims. <br>
EMH: Vulcan neural tissue is extremely resilient. I have no doubt that
a brain from a lesser species would not have survived. <br>
NAROQ: If you could only tell us what you saw, Mister Tuvok. <br>
EMH: I don't think we'll be hearing from him any time soon. <br>
JANEWAY: Keep working. I'll let you know if we find anything that might
help. I'll take you to see where the attack occurred. <br>(Janeway and Naroq leave.)<br>
EMH: Something I can do for you, Mister Neelix? <br>
NEELIX: I want to help. <br>
EMH: Unless you have a degree in Vulcan neurobiology that I'm not aware
of, there's nothing you can do. <br>
NEELIX: There must be something. <br>
EMH: My advice is to return to your quarters and get some rest. <br>
NEELIX: There's no way that I'm going to be able to sleep knowing that
Tuvok is lying here like this. <br>
EMH: There have been rare cases in which comatose patients responded to
external stimuli. Aromas, touch, voices. <br>
NEELIX: So, you're saying that if I stay here and, and try to talk to
Tuvok, I might be able to provoke some sort of response? <br>
EMH: If anyone can provoke Tuvok, Mister Neelix, it's you. <br>(Later, Neelix is wheeling a trolley full of Tuvok's possessions into Sickbay.)<br>NEELIX:
Good morning, Tuvok. I brought you a few more items from your quarters
to help liven up Sickbay. Your
kal-toh game, in case you decide you're ready for a match. Oh, and I
also thought that you might enjoy a recitation of that classic
proto-Vulcan drama, Clash on the Fire Plains. I'll be performing all
twenty three parts
myself. I also brought you some flowers from the Airponics bay. Oh,
that's fragrant, isn't it? Perhaps you'd enjoy some Vulcan incense. How
about some music? Computer, access Vulcan audio file, selection fifty
six alpha. <br>
EMH: Mister Neelix. What is that dreadful noise? <br>
NEELIX: The Chants of the Monks of T'Panit. Personally, I think it's
dreadful, too, but it's one of Tuvok's
favourites. <br>
EMH: I appreciate your efforts, Mister Neelix, but I'm trying to
analyse his latest neurological scans and this music is very
distracting. <br>
NEELIX: You said I was supposed to stimulate his senses. <br>
EMH: I said stimulate them, Mister Neelix, not annihilate them. <br>
NEELIX: Computer, pause music. <br>
EMH: Thank you. <br>(The EMH returns to his office. Tuvok has sat up on his biobed.)<br>
NEELIX: Doctor? Tuvok. You've had an accident. You're in Sickbay. <br>
EMH: Relax, Commander, I only want to scan you. <br>
NEELIX: Don't worry, Tuvok, he's only trying to help you. It's only a
tricorder. See? It won't hurt you. <br>(Neelix demonstrates by scanning himself.) <br>NEELIX: Now try it. <br>
EMH: Well done, Mister Neelix. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Delta
Flyer - aft section]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Commander Chakotay says you've found something. <br>
NAROQ: That, Captain, is an understatement. Listen. <br>(Naroq's device beeps faster as he approaches the bulkhead that wibbled.)<br>
JANEWAY: What is it? <br>
NAROQ: The sound of history being made. <br>
JANEWAY: Less poetry, Mister Naroq, more facts. <br>
NAROQ: The sound you're hearing indicates the presence of veridium
isotopes. <br>
SEVEN: Residual particles from the Ba'Neth's cloaking field. <br>
JANEWAY: You've detected these isotopes before? <br>
NAROQ: Yes, but only after they've decayed. You see, veridium has a
very brief half-life, less than seventy hours. The previous sites I've
studied have been months, sometimes years old. <br>
JANEWAY: But these isotopes are still active. <br>
SEVEN: We can use Mister Naroq's photolytic converter to illuminate
them. <br>
NAROQ: So you see, Captain, why this is an historic moment? We may
finally learn what the Ba'Neth look like. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, let's see what we've got. <br>(The converter flashes, and a shape starts to form.)<br>
NAROQ: You don't know how long I've waited to meet you. <br>
JANEWAY: So the Ba'Neth aren't a myth after all. <br>
NAROQ: This is the clearest image ever captured. <br>
SEVEN: Perhaps. I believe I can adjust our internal sensors to improve
it. <br>
NAROQ: What are you doing? You might disrupt the image entirely.
Tentacles. I always suspected they were multipeds! <br>
EMH [OC]: Doctor to the Captain. Please report to Sickbay. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm on my way. Seven, if we can integrate Mister Naroq's
photolytic technology into the deflector array, we might be able to
decloak a Ba'Neth ship. <br>
NAROQ: The technology only works at close range. We have to find the
ship before we can expose it. We still need that cloaking frequency. <br>
JANEWAY: One step at a time. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Doctor's office]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: The
Vulcan brain. A puzzle wrapped inside an enigma housed inside a
cranium. Tuvok's neural pathways have begun to bypass the damaged
tissue. They're forming new synaptic connections. In effect, his brain
is rewiring itself. Whether this is due to my neurostatic therapy, or
Neelix's rehabilitation regimen, or some combination of the two I can't
be certain. <br>
JANEWAY: Is there any chance he'll make a full recovery? <br>
EMH: It's much too soon to say, but he's alert and he's already
regained his basic motor skills. <br>
JANEWAY: But still no speech. <br>
NEELIX: It's only a matter of time, Captain. Look how far he's come
already. <br>
JANEWAY: I hope you're right, Neelix, but if he could talk he might be
able to tell us something about that cloaking frequency. <br>(Tuvok is enjoying smelling the flowers Neelix brought in.)<br>
EMH: We're not sure how much he recalls. For that matter, we're not
certain he recognises any of us, or even knows who he is. <br>
NEELIX: I'm going to take him on a tour of the ship. The Doctor thinks
that familiar sights and sounds might get the old synaptic juices
flowing. Don't worry, Captain. Tuvok will be back to his old self
before you can say live long and prosper.

KIM: Just keeping it warm for you. Hope you don't mind. That's the

JANEWAY: Yes, and in order to help you, we have to find the people who
hurt you. <br>
NAROQ: Before the intruder injured you, you managed to scan him with
this. You recorded his cloaking frequency, but the tricorder was
damaged and the information was lost. Can you tell us anything about
that frequency? <br>

first locate them, which we cannot accomplish without their cloaking
frequency. <br>
NEELIX: That's quite a riddle. <br>
SEVEN: One that we might be able to solve if Commander Tuvok could tell
us what he saw. How is his rehabilitation progressing? <br>
NEELIX: Oh, I thought it was going great, but now? Let's just say that
I've got a riddle of my own. <br>
SEVEN: Try me. <br>
NEELIX: All right. When is a Vulcan no longer a Vulcan? <br>
SEVEN: When his genetic code is sufficiently altered. <br>
NEELIX: No, I was speaking metaphorically. <br>
SEVEN: In that case, a person is no longer Vulcan when he has lost his
logic. <br>
NEELIX: Right. And how does he get it back? <br>
SEVEN: He must be taught. <br>
NEELIX: Exactly. But what if he's brain-damaged and emotionally
unstable? How does he learn? <br>
SEVEN: It may be impossible for him to learn what you're trying to
teach. <br>
NEELIX: Well, thanks for the pep talk. <br>
SEVEN: I was merely suggesting that you adapt to the circumstances. <br>
NEELIX: What circumstances? Are you saying that the Tuvok I know is
gone? That I should stop trying to help him? <br>
SEVEN: When I was separated from the Collective I, too, was damaged. I
was no longer connected to the hive mind. I lost many abilities that I
had acquired as a drone, but I adapted. <br>
NEELIX: Because Captain Janeway didn't give up on you. She kept trying
to help you. <br>
SEVEN: But not by restoring me to what I'd been. By helping me discover
what I could become. </font></p>

What are you making? <br>
TUVOK: A flower. It's for you. <br>
NEELIX: Thank you. I'm not sure I deserve a gift. <br>
TUVOK: I shouldn't have shouted at you. I was angry. I'm sorry. <br>
NEELIX: You were frustrated. I don't blame you. I'm the one who should
be apologising. <br>
TUVOK: Why? <br>
NEELIX: Because I was pushing you too hard. I was trying to mould you
into something you weren't. <br>
TUVOK: You were disappointed in me because I can't do anything as well
as I did before. <br>
NEELIX: Maybe there are things that you can do better. <br>
TUVOK: What can I do better? <br>
NEELIX: Well,&nbsp;this, for example. You would've considered it an
illogical use of your time. <br>
TUVOK: It's not good. <br>
NEELIX: No, it's wonderful. It's creative. It's a symbol of friendship.
Before your accident, you never would have considered that my feelings
might have been hurt. You would have certainly never have made me
a gift. <br>
TUVOK: We weren't friends? <br>
NEELIX: Ah, we were colleagues, and I certainly felt affection for you.
<br>
TUVOK: But I didn't return those feelings. <br>
NEELIX: You tolerated me. <br>
TUVOK: I don't understand. <br>
NEELIX: You said things like 'Mister Neelix, please contain your
exuberance.' And, 'Mister Neelix I have no desire for fun.' And you
never smiled. You've got a much better sense of humour now. <br>
TUVOK: I like to smile. <br>
NEELIX: Me, too. <br>
TUVOK: I don't want to play kal-toh any more. Or meditate, or work on
logic problems. <br>
NEELIX: You don't have to. <br>
TUVOK: What can we do instead? <br>
NEELIX: Whatever you want. <br>

Here we are. A triple-chocolate wikki fruit sundae with warm fetran
sauce. <br>
PARIS: Fetran sauce on a sundae? <br>
NEELIX: Wait till you taste it. <br>
KIM: You really made this? <br>
TUVOK: As Neelix says, dig in. <br>
KIM: Mmm, this is great. <br>
PARIS: This is fantastic. <br>
NEELIX: What did I tell you? Tuvok has a flair for food. All morning,
he's been creating new recipes using combinations of ingredients that I
never would have imagined. For example. A terra nut soufflé, Jibalian
fudge cake with peppermint coulis, sweet leola root tart. Mmm. <br>
PARIS: Only desserts? How come? <br>
TUVOK: They taste good. <br>
KIM: Hey, you better watch out, Neelix. Tuvok may put you out of a job.
<br>(Janeway enters.)<br>
PARIS: From your mouth to the Captain's ears. <br>
KIM: She must have heard me. <br>
JANEWAY: What's all this? <br>
TUVOK: We're having fun. <br>
PARIS: It turns out Tuvok is quite the pastry chef. <br>
TUVOK: Would you like some terra nut soufflé, Captain? <br>
JANEWAY:I'd love some. Thank you. Oh, that is delicious. <br>
TUVOK: I am pleased that you like it. <br>
JANEWAY: What are you making now? <br>
TUVOK: Pistachio cake with parra-cream sauce. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, parra-cream's my favourite. <br>
TUVOK: Then you'll have the first piece. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok, have you remembered anything more about what happened
on the Flyer? <br>
TUVOK: I detected a cloaking frequency. <br>
JANEWAY: Yes, that's right. Can you describe it? <br>
TUVOK: I don't know, I <br>
JANEWAY: Did it have a symmetric modulation? Was the amplitude
constant? <br>
TUVOK: I don't understand. <br>(Tuvok has an icing bag in his hand.)<br>
JANEWAY: It's all right. I don't mean to push you, Tuvok but maybe if
we could <br>
NEELIX: It's difficult for him, Captain. Maybe you can try again
tomorrow. <br>
TUVOK: This. This is what I saw. <br>(He has iced the modulation pattern onto a cake.)<br>
NEELIX: What is it? <br>
JANEWAY: A cloaking frequency. </font></p>

KIM: It's an armed outpost.&nbsp;Approximately three thousand life signs,
twenty two ships. <br>
JANEWAY: Hail them. <br>
KIM: No response, Captain. <br>
CHAKOTAY: They're charging weapons. <br>
JANEWAY: Open a channel, all subspace bands. <br>
CHAKOTAY: They're firing. <br>
JANEWAY: Cease fire immediately, or I'll transmit the coordinates of
this outpost to the Kesat homeworld. <br>
PARIS: That got their attention. <br>
JANEWAY: Several days ago, a member of your species attacked one of my
crewmen. He was badly injured. In order to treat him, I need to know
more about the weapon that was used. <br>
KIM: They're responding. Audio only. <br>(The Ba'Neth sound as if they are gargling.)<br>
BA'NETH [OC]: We do not share technology. <br>
JANEWAY: But you take it from others. The attacker was downloading our
tactical database when the incident occurred. <br>
BA'NETH [OC]: We must assess potential threats. <br>
NAROQ: Paranoid, just as I predicted. <br>
JANEWAY: In exchange for information about your weapon, we'll provide
you with tactical data on several species we've recently encountered.
You can assess their potential threats all you want. <br>
BA'NETH [OC]: The Kesat investigator aboard your vessel cannot be
trusted. <br>
NAROQ: You know about me? <br>
BA'NETH [OC]: You have been attempting to expose us for years. You are
a threat. You must be stopped. <br>
CHAKOTAY: They're charging weapons again. <br>
NAROQ: Wait. It was my photolytic converter that allowed Voyager to
decloak you. If you give Captain Janeway what she wants, I'll give you
the converter. You can use it to adapt your technology so ours can no
longer expose you. <br>
JANEWAY: I doubt you'll get as enticing an offer from the Kesat
homeworld. It would be a shame if you forced me to hail them. <br>

NEELIX: What are you listening to? <br>
TUVOK: A selection from Tom's jazz database. It really swings.
Computer, pause the music. I've been reviewing the holodeck files. I
wish to visit the Risa water recreation park. Will you accompany me? <br>
NEELIX: Maybe after your Doctor's appointment. <br>
TUVOK: Appointment? <br>
NEELIX: The Doctor's analysed the Ba'Neth weapon, and he's devised a
procedure to treat you. You should be proud of yourself. If you hadn't
drawn that picture on the cake, we may never have found a treatment. <br>
TUVOK: I wish I never drew that picture. <br>
NEELIX: Why? <br>
TUVOK: Because I don't wish to undergo the procedure. <br>
NEELIX: You're having pre-operative jitters, that's all. Don't worry,
everyone gets them. Just think about it. In a few hours, you'll be
yourself again. <br>
TUVOK: I am myself. <br>
NEELIX: But you'll be able to do all the things that you used to do.
Work on the bridge, advise the Captain. <br>
TUVOK: I want to be able to have fun. With you. I won't be able to,
will I? <br>
NEELIX: Well, you won't call it fun. You'll call it deriving
satisfaction. But it's basically the same thing. You'll still
experience emotions. <br>
TUVOK: But I won't express them. <br>
NEELIX: Probably not. <br>
TUVOK: Then how will you know how much I enjoy being with you? <br>

TUVOK: We'll still be friends? <br>
NEELIX: Of course. <br>
TUVOK: Even if I merely tolerate you? <br>
NEELIX: I'd be lying if I told you that things between us will stay the
same. <br>
TUVOK: Well, why? Why do you want me to go back to the way I was? <br>
NEELIX: Because this crew needs its tactical officer on the bridge. And
I wouldn't be a very good friend if I ignored that just so that you'd be
nicer to me. </font></p>

preparation of nutritionally deficient foods. <br>

to me that he could also have eaten the Sundaes. <br>
