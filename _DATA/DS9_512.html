KIRA: Where do you want me to put this? <br>
ODO: Wherever you can find room. <br>
KIRA: I bet you can't wait to get all this put together so you can
start shape-shifting around the room again. <br>
ODO: I suppose. Though I did enjoy sleeping in a bed. <br>
KIRA: There's nothing to stop you from sleeping in a bed if you want
to. <br>
ODO: Except that now when I'm asleep I tend to revert to my gelatinous
state and slide onto the floor. No, the bed goes. I'm a changeling, not
a solid. There's no use pretending otherwise. <br>
KIRA: I guess we can put all this in storage. What about these PADDS?
Finding and Winning your Perfect Mate by Doctor Jennings Rain? <br>
ODO: I'll take that. I thought I was going to be a humanoid for the
rest of my life. There were certain things <br>
KIRA: You don't have to explain, Odo. <br>
ODO: I only read the first three chapters. <br>
KIRA: Maybe you should finish it. <br>
ODO: Why waste my time? Romance is for solids. <br>
KIRA: You are a solid, eighteen hours a day. I'm sure there are plenty
of woman on this station who would be very interested in you if you
gave them a chance. <br>
ODO: I'll keep that in mind, Major. Right now I'd be satisfied just
getting this room in order. <br>
DAX [OC]: Dax to Kira and Odo. <br>

Quadrant picked this up a few minutes ago. <br>
DAX: It looks like a Cardassian military code, but the computer doesn't
recognise it. <br>
KIRA: Oh, it's Cardassian all right. But I didn't think there were any
Cardassians in the Gamma Quadrant. <br>
SISKO: None that we know of. <br>
ODO: Not Elgol-red or Fifth Order military encryption. <br>
KIRA: Try courier code five nine. <br>
ODO: Strange. Most Cardassian codes use a recursive encryption
algorithm, but this has a completely different coding system. <br>
KIRA: Bajoran Intelligence has a lot of experience breaking Cardassian
codes. Why don't you send it to them? <br>
DAX: We did, as soon as it came in. We still haven't heard from them. <br>
ODO: It might take some time. <br>
SISKO: If someone's sending coded Cardassian messages from the Gamma
Quadrant, I want to know what they're saying. Now. <br>

BASHIR: It's good to see you again, Carrie. <br>
GARAK: I'm sorry for the interruption. <br>
ZIYAL: Well, how did it go? <br>
GARAK: I'm afraid I disappointed them. I think they were hoping that
message they picked up would contain the key to defeating the Dominion.
You should've seen the looks on their faces when I explained to them
that it was a five-year old planetary survey report. <br>
BASHIR: A planetary survey report? <br>
GARAK: That's the look exactly. <br>
BASHIR: I would have thought you'd be a little disappointed, too. After
all, it could have been from one of the survivors of the Cardassian
fleet that was lost in the Gamma Quadrant. <br>
GARAK: Oh, I'd given up hope of ever finding any trace of them long
ago. <br>
ZIYAL: Really? I never saw you as the giving up type. <br>
GARAK: There comes a time when one must face reality, my dear. Those
people are gone and are never coming back. Well, my young friends, I'd
like to stay here and chat all day, but I have dresses to make,
trousers to mend. It's a full life, if a trifle banal. And do tell
Captain Sisko that I'd be more than happy to decode any Cardassian
laundry lists that come across his desk. My dear. <br>
(Garak leaves.) <br>
ZIYAL: My father would be furious to hear me say this, but there's
something about Garak I find fascinating. <br>
BASHIR: Yes, he has his moments.

BASHIR: Going somewhere? <br>
GARAK: I really must remember to stop underestimating you, Doctor. How
did you know? <br>
BASHIR: You mean that you were lying about the contents of the message?
You said you'd given up on the Cardassian survivors who were lost in
the Gamma Quadrant. Well, Ziyal was right. You're not the giving up
sort. <br>
GARAK: Very good, Doctor. You've come a long way from the naive young
man I met five years ago. You've become distrustful and suspicious. It
suits you. <br>
BASHIR: I had a good teacher. What did the message really say, Garak? <br>
GARAK: It was a call for help from Enabran Tain. <br>
BASHIR: Tain? But you said you'd seen his ship destroyed by the
Dominion. <br>
GARAK: I did. But Enabran Tain was the head of the Obsidian order for
twenty years. If he can survive that, he can survive anything. I have
to find him, Doctor. I owe it to him. <br>
BASHIR: You don't owe Tain anything. He had you exiled from Cardassia. <br>
GARAK: Yes, but aside from that, we were very close. He was my mentor,
and I'm not going to turn my back on him. If it'll make you feel
better, you can come with me. All you have to do is come up with an
excuse why you need the runabout and we could leave immediately. <br>
BASHIR: So let me get this straight. You want me to lie to my
commanding officer, violate Starfleet regulations, and go with you on a
mission into the Gamma Quadrant which will probably get us both killed?
<br>
GARAK: I'm ready when you are. <br>
BASHIR: In that case, let's go. To Captain's Sisko's office.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Captain's office]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: How do you know that the message isn't a
fake? That it was really sent by Tain? <br>
GARAK: The code sequence was personally designed by Tain and myself. No
one else knows it. Now somehow he got that message out, and I have to
follow it back to its source. <br>
SISKO: Did the message contain any coordinates? <br>
GARAK: No. Most of it was identification code. The rest was just one
word, alive, repeated over and over again. So it should be easy enough
to triangulate the source. Captain, Tain might not be alone. There
could be others. Troops from the Cardassian-Romulan fleet, survivors
from the Dominion attack on New Bajor, and even crew members from the
Federation ships that disappeared in the Gamma Quadrant. This is a
mission of mercy. You can't ignore it. <br>
SISKO: I'm still not totally convinced that it's a genuine message. But
I suppose there's only one way to find out. <br>
BASHIR: Captain, you can't let him go. It's too dangerous. <br>
GARAK: Your concern is touching, Doctor, but I assure you I can take
care of myself. <br>
SISKO: Maybe you can, but you're still not going alone. <br>
GARAK: Doctor, I think you've just volunteered. <br>
SISKO: Doctor Bashir isn't going anywhere. But I do have someone else
in mind.

Gamma Quadrant with Garak or that I had to hear it from Sisko. <br>
WORF: I was going to tell you. <br>
DAX: When? On your way out the airlock? <br>
WORF: A Klingon warrior does not have to explain why he chooses to face
danger, not even to his par'machkai. <br>
DAX: So in other words, you were afraid I'd make a scene, that I'd
embarrass you. Maybe even cry. <br>
WORF: You are capable of anything. <br>
DAX: Don't worry, Worf. I won't be shedding any tears over you. <br>
WORF: Then you came to wish me a good death in battle. <br>
DAX: No. I came for these. <br>

WORF: My Klingon operas. <br>
DAX: Well, you won't be using them for the next few days. Somebody
might as well enjoy them. What? Something wrong? <br>
WORF: You have a tendency to misplace things. <br>
DAX: And you're afraid that I might lose your precious operas? <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
DAX: It's a distinct possibility. If I were you, I'd hurry back. That
is, if you want to keep your collection intact. <br>

character. <br>
ZIYAL: Why do you always make fun of my feelings for you? <br>
GARAK: Perhaps because I find them a but misguided. <br>
ZIYAL: If that's what you think, why do you spend so much time with me?

GARAK: Because I'm exiled and alone, and a long way from home. And when
I'm with you it doesn't feel so bad. <br>

regret them. That's why I want to join Starfleet. Why I need to join
Starfleet. I'm looking for a fresh start, a way to make up for all the

KIRA: I wouldn't call it love. <br>
DUKAT: So you've known about this all along, and you've done nothing to

KIRA: She was lonely. The last time I checked, he's the only other
Cardassian living on the station. <br>
DUKAT: The man is a heartless, cold-blooded killer. <br>
KIRA: Like I said, he's a Cardassian. Your daughter is a grown woman,
capable of making her own decisions. I'm not fond of Garak, and I may
even think that their friendship is a mistake, but the way I see it,
that's her prerogative. <br>
DUKAT: You did this on purpose, didn't you? <br>
KIRA: Did what? <br>
DUKAT: Allowed my daughter to associate with a man you knew was my
enemy. Stood by while he whispered poison in her ear. And all under the
guise of doing me a favour. <br>
KIRA: Dukat, let's get one thing straight. I didn't bring Ziyal to the
station for you. I did it for her. Because I knew it'd be better for
her to be here than being a soldier fighting in your private little war
with the Klingons. <br>
DUKAT: Save your excuses, Major. You've betrayed me, and I promise I
won't forget it. <br>

GARAK: What do you mean? <br>
WORF: My readings indicate the source of that coded signal is deep in
Dominion space. I have strict orders to avoid unnecessary risk. We must
turn back. <br>
GARAK: Well I certainly don't want to take an unnecessary risk, but our
sensors show no sign of Jem'Hadar warships in this area. <br>
WORF: True. But the likelihood of contact will increase from this point
on, and my orders were very clear. <br>

get light years closer to the source of the transmission. <br>
WORF: Our shields would be useless in that nebula. <br>
GARAK: But so would Jem'Hadar sensors. The answer is out there,
Commander. We just have to have the courage to find it. And remember,
it's not just Tain we're looking for. The Maryland, the Proxima, the
Sarajevo. Starfleet ships that have been lost in the Gamma Quadrant for
years, and their crews, brave soldiers, warriors of the Federation
unaccounted for. We owe it to them to do everything in our power to
find them and bring them home. It's the honourable thing to do. <br>

GARAK: There are four more Jem'Hadar ships in close pursuit, and at
least two ahead of us on an intercept course. <br>
WORF: We must warn the station. There is only one reason for the
Dominion to hide such a large fleet this close to the wormhole. <br>
GARAK: You think they're planning to attack the Alpha Quadrant? <br>
WORF: I'm certain of it. <br>
GARAK: Your message is transmitting, but it's hard to tell if it's
getting through all this interference. <br>
WORF: We've got to get clear of the nebula. <br>
GARAK: What happened? We've just come to a dead stop. <br>

ZIYAL: You should have come into the Shrine. <br>
DUKAT: No, I don't think so. <br>
ZIYAL: So, where would you like to have dinner? <br>
DUKAT: Forget about dinner. I want you to go to back your quarters and
pack your things. There's a ship leaving for Cardassia in the morning.
I want you on it. <br>
ZIYAL: You're sending me to Cardassia? <br>
DUKAT: I've just learned there's a Dominion fleet headed for the
wormhole. This place is not safe any longer. <br>
ZIYAL: Father, I'm not sure that I want to go. <br>
DUKAT: Ziyal, there's nothing to discuss. I'm not going to let any harm
come to you. Now, I think you'd better get ready to leave.

MARTOK: Two years. <br>
GARAK: Aren't you Klingons supposed to kill yourselves when you're

WORF: Not when there are still enemies to fight. <br>

said you would come.

GARAK: That's it? After I've come all this way, after all I've been
through, that's all you have to say to me? <br>
TAIN: What do you want me to say? <br>
GARAK: I want you to say thank you, Elim. Your loyalty is most
gratifying. I knew I could count on you. <br>

KIRA: What's he doing here? <br>
DUKAT: Captain Sisko invited me. <br>
SISKO: A Dominion invasion of the Alpha Quadrant will affect Cardassia
every bit as much as it's going to affect us. Besides, we need all the
help we can get. The Dominion picked a perfect time to invade. The
Cardassian fleet is in shambles, the Romulans are not much better off,
and between the Klingon War and <a href="../movies/movie8.html" target="_blank"> the recent Borg attack</a>,
Starfleet's spread pretty thin.&nbsp; <br>
KIRA: Then we're going to have our hands full. There're at least fifty
Dominion ships headed our way. For all we know, that could be just the
first wave. <br>
DAX: How soon can we expect reinforcements to get here? <br>
SISKO: At maximum warp, two days. <br>
KIRA: Not soon enough. <br>
O'BRIEN: What help can we expect from Cardassia? <br>
DUKAT: My ship and my crew are at your disposal. <br>
BASHIR: One ship. Things are looking brighter. <br>
SISKO: Right now, there's no way we can beat the Dominion. Our only
hope is to prevent their fleet from entering the Alpha Quadrant. <br>
KIRA: You're going to destroy the wormhole? <br>
SISKO: It's always been a final option. I'd hoped to never use it. <br>
KIRA: But the Celestial Temple, the Prophets <br>
SISKO Professor Kahn of the Trill Science Ministry has come up with a
way to seal the wormhole without damaging it or harming the Prophets. <br>
KIRA: But Bajor will be cut off from the Celestial Temple. <br>
SISKO: History has shown whenever the Prophets want to communicate with
Bajor, they find a way. <br>
KIRA: But <br>
SISKO: It's either that or Bajor becomes the first Dominion target. <br>
O'BRIEN: We'll have to remodulate the deflector grid frequencies and
rig a phase-conjugate graviton beam. <br>
SISKO: You and Dax start working immediately. <br>
DAX: What about Worf? <br>
ODO: If we close the wormhole, he and Garak will be trapped in the
Gamma Quadrant. <br>
DUKAT: Casualties of war. <br>
SISKO: They have thirty six hours to find their way home. Let's hope
they can make it. Dismissed.

prison, the Dominion used to mine ultritium here. There was no dome.
Each of these barracks had its own life support system embedded in the
walls. <br>
GARAK: And Tain was able to modify that life support system and create
a subspace transmitter? <br>
MARTOK: Yes. There's a crawl space just behind those panels. He spent
hours in there working every day for months on end. Cardassians.
They're clever people. Especially that one. But in just a few days at
best, he'll be dead. <br>

BASHIR: Over a month ago. I was attending a burn treatment conference
on Meezan Four. I went to bed one night and woke up here. <br>
MARTOK: The same thing happened to me, except I was hunting sabre bear
out on Kang's Summit. Little did I know I was being stalked as well.

of countless Klingons. It is a grave dishonour. <br>

already, and even if he isn't, the Federation is going to seal the

I will. <br>
