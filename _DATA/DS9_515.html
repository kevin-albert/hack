COMPUTER: Eighteen twenty one hours. <br>
(The doorbell rings. He takes a pen-like thing out of a satchel and
slips it up his sleeve, then opens the door.) <br>
TAUVID: Can I help you? <br>
TRAIDY: I think so. <br>
(The tall, thin alien pushes Tauvid back into the room.) <br>
TAUVID: What are you doing? <br>
(Sorm, his shorter companion, punches Torvid in the abdomen.) <br>
TRAIDY: Where is it? <br>
TAUVID: Where is what? I don't even know what you're looking for. <br>
TRAIDY: Yes, you do. (to Sorm) Well? <br>
SORM: (scanning) It's not here. <br>
TRAIDY: That's not good. Is it possible we have the wrong man? <br>
SORM: It's starting to look that way. <br>
TRAIDY: This is very embarrassing. Now listen to me. We know why you're
here, we know who you came to meet, and we know what you were going to
give her. So for the last time, where is it? <br>
TAUVID: All right, I'll take you to it. <br>
TRAIDY: You see? It was him all along. <br>
(Tauvid pulls his weapon but Sorm vapourises him) <br>
SORM: I thought it was on stun. <br>
TRAIDY: Look what you did to the carpet. <br>
(Scorch marks where Tauvid was kneeling when he died.) <br>
SORM: What do we do now? We don't have time to search the whole
station. <br>
TRAIDY: We wait for the woman. She might know where he hid it </font></p>

(Bashir presents an isolinear rod) <br>
DAX: Is that the new holosuite programme? <br>
BASHIR: Queen's Gambit. It came in this morning. <br>
O'BRIEN: Finally. That friend of yours promised to send it two months
ago. <br>
BASHIR: According to Felix, it's worth the wait. He said it's the most
elaborate programme he's ever designed. <br>
DAX: What parts do we get to play? <br>
BASHIR: You get to play Lady Wantsomore, a beautiful socialite who's
brainwashed to assassinate the Queen of England. <br>
DAX: Ooo, somebody stop me. <br>
O'BRIEN: What about me? <br>
BASHIR: Odo plays Nigel Dunlop, a former agent who comes out of
retirement to help me foil this diabolical plot. <br>
DAX: Perfect. <br>
BASHIR: I play <br>
O'BRIEN: Julian, we know who you play. What about me? <br>
BASHIR: You're Falcon, of course. <br>
O'BRIEN: Falcon? Again? I'm tired of being the bad guy. <br>
DAX: But you do it so well. <br>
BASHIR: So, is everybody all right for Saturday? <br>
DAX: Fine. <br>
O'BRIEN: No problem. <br>
BASHIR: Odo? <br>
ODO: What do you want me to do again? <br>
DAX: Save the Queen. <br>
BASHIR: Not only that, you get to drive around in fancy automobiles,
and go to posh parties and steal her (picture on PADD) away from
Falcon. <br>
O'BRIEN: He steals my girl? <br>
ODO: Er, maybe you'd better get another Nigel Dunlop. <br>
BASHIR: Are you kidding? Look at her. <br>
ODO: I'm, I'm busy on Saturday. <br>
DAX: We'll do it when you're not busy. <br>
ODO: I don't think so. I'm sorry. I never should have agreed to be a
part of this in the first place. Sorry. <br>
(Odo heads downstairs) <br>
BASHIR: Well, looks like we'll have to find someone else to play Odo's
part. <br>
(O'Brien takes another look at the lissome blonde character in
holosuite programme 5547.) <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll do it.

ARISSA: I've already told you, I don't want to play dabo, I don't want
a holosuite, and I don't want anything to eat. <br>
QUARK: Can I interest you in my collection of Risean tapestries? <br>
ODO: Why don't you leave her alone, Quark. Can't you see she's not
interested? <br>
QUARK: How do I know she's not interested unless I ask? <br>
ARISSA: Maybe you should spend less time bothering your customers, and
more time keeping an eye on your business. <br>
QUARK: Don't worry, I can keep my eyes on more than one thing at a
time. <br>
ARISSA: Really? What about him? <br>
(An alien up the upper level is fiddling with a ring) <br>
ARISSA: He's got a graviton emitter hidden in his ring. He's
manipulating the table for his friend over there. <br>
CROWD: Dabo! <br>
(Quark dashes away.) <br>
ODO: You're very observant. <br>
ARISSA: Thanks. <br>
ODO: Are you waiting for someone? <br>
ARISSA: You. Where have you been all my life? <br>
ODO: Pardon me? <br>
ARISSA: Isn't that what you were hoping I'd say? <br>
ODO: It's just that you keep glancing at the door. <br>
ARISSA: I'm waiting for someone. <br>
ODO: That's all I meant. <br>
ARISSA: Sorry. I thought you had other things on your mind. Must be
those bedroom eyes of yours. <br>
ODO: Bedroom eyes? <br>
ARISSA: You probably get that all the time. <br>
ODO: Not really. If anyone bothers you again, let me know. I'm Security
Chief Odo. My office is just across the Promenade. <br>
ARISSA: I'll be all right. <br>
ODO: Well, I have to go. To work. In my office. <br>
ARISSA: Across the Promenade. <br>
ODO: Exactly. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: Look at this. I was checking the contents of
one of those crates. A tentacle grabbed my hand. <br>
ODO: Gagh. The Klingons have been getting regular shipments of it since
the day they were posted here. <br>
KIRA: I can't believe they eat that stuff. <br>
(Odo is looking at his reflection in the side of a crate.) <br>
KIRA: What are you doing? <br>
ODO: Nothing. <br>
KIRA: What are you looking at? <br>
ODO: Well, I'm. Actually I'm. I'm never mind. <br>
KIRA: What? <br>
ODO: It's embarrassing. <br>
KIRA: Would you just tell me. <br>
ODO: Last night, a woman in Quark's told me I have bedroom eyes. I'm
trying to see if it's true. <br>
KIRA: Tell me about this woman. <br>
ODO: She thought I was trying to seduce her. It was all just a
misunderstanding. <br>
KIRA: If you say so. You going to see her again? <br>
ODO: I have no idea. Why? <br>
KIRA: Obviously she's very perceptive. <br>
ODO: Meaning what? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARISSA: Hello again. <br>
ODO: What's this all about? <br>
(The deputy hands over a PADD and leaves.) <br>
ODO: You tried to break into the station computer. Why? <br>
ARISSA: My friend never showed up last night. I wanted to check the
passenger manifests to find out if he came aboard. <br>
ODO: Why didn't you come to me? I could have checked the manifests for
you. <br>
ARISSA: When you grow up on Finnea Prime, you learn not to trust
policemen. <br>
ODO: Dataport bothering you? <br>
(It's just behind her left ear.) <br>
ARISSA: The security protocols protecting your computer generated some
nasty feedback. <br>
ODO: I know. I designed them that way. <br>
ARISSA: Nice job. I couldn't stay interfaced long enough to break past
the encryption lockouts. <br>
ODO: That was the idea. Tell me, Arissa, what's a nice woman like you
doing with a dataport? <br>
ARISSA: They're not illegal. <br>
ODO: They ought to be. People tend to use them to access information
other people don't want them to access. <br>
ARISSA: I've heard that. <br>
ODO: This Idanian you were waiting for in Quark's, Tauvid Rem. What
were you meeting him about? <br>
ARISSA: A personal matter. <br>
ODO: Well, I suppose I could just go to his quarters and ask him. <br>
ARISSA: I'd rather you didn't. It's a delicate situation. <br>
ODO: I'm listening. <br>
ARISSA: Tauvid's well known for finding people. People who don't
necessarily want to be found. He's helping me locate my daughter. I
gave her up when she was born fifteen years ago. <br>
ODO: I see. <br>
ARISSA: He told me he had information about her. That's all I know.
I've been looking for her a long time. Please, let me talk to him. <br>
ODO: All right. I'll take you to him. We'll sort the rest out later. <br>
ARISSA: Thank you.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: The residue we found contains Idanian DNA. I
think it's safe to assume it came from Tauvid Rem. Do you have any idea
why someone would want to kill him? <br>
ARISSA: No, but considering what he does for a living, he probably had
dealings with all sorts of marginal characters. Maybe it was a robbery.
<br>
ODO: What makes you say that? <br>
ARISSA: I didn't see any personal belongings in his quarters. Did your
deputies find anything? <br>
ODO: No. <br>
ARISSA: Well, whatever happened, I doubt it had anything to do with me
or my daughter. <br>
ODO: That depends. It's possible that someone doesn't want you to find
your daughter. <br>
ARISSA: Tauvid didn't give me any indication of that when we spoke. <br>
ODO: When was that? <br>
ARISSA: About three days ago. I can't believe this. I was so close to
finding her and now I'm going to have to start all over again. That's
if you'll let me. <br>
ODO: If? <br>
ARISSA: In case you'd forgotten, I'm facing charges for trying to break
into your computer. <br>
ODO: Considering you weren't able to access any secured information,
I've decided to drop those charges. <br>
ARISSA: I appreciate that very much. <br>
ODO: You're free to go. <br>
ARISSA: Thank you. You're a very kind man. <br>

(Morn comes out of the bar.) <br>
QUARK: Go home. <br>
(We follow Morn along then pick up Arissa coming out of somewhere.) <br>
ODO: I'm afraid the Assay Office is closed for the evening. If you want
to secure any valuables, you'll have to come back in the morning. <br>
ARISSA: Thanks, I'll do that. I didn't realise I tripped an alarm. <br>
ODO: You didn't. You're good. <br>
ARISSA: I still got caught. <br>
ODO: I've been following you. <br>
ARISSA: I didn't know. <br>

ARISSA: Would you believe me if I said no? <br>
ODO: Actually, I'd have you strip-searched. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Security office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: I've never seen a data crystal quite like
this. It looks like it has a phase inverter embedded inside it. It's
not going to be easy to decode. Given that all it contains is
information about a missing girl, Tauvid went to great lengths to
secure it. <br>
ARISSA: You know how Idanians are. They're a secretive race. <br>
ODO: You realise it would be a simple matter for me to have a Doctor
examine you to determine if you've ever been pregnant. <br>
ARISSA: You keep threatening to have me stripped down and examined. I'm
trying not to read too much into that. <br>
ODO: You don't have a daughter, do you? <br>
ARISSA: No. <br>
ODO: That's probably the first true statement I've heard you make. <br>
ARISSA: Not quite. I meant what I said about your eyes. <br>
ODO: What's on the crystal? <br>
ARISSA: I don't know, but I need to find out. <br>
ODO: Why? <br>
ARISSA: Because if I don't, I'm dead. <br>
ODO: Maybe you'd better start at the beginning. <br>
ARISSA: I work for a man named Draim. I see you've heard of him. <br>
ODO: He's with the Orion Syndicate. If I'm not mistaken, he specialises
in blackmail and extortion. Where do you fit in with his organisation? <br>
ARISSA: I access computer systems and steal information for him,
government data, business plans, whatever he asks for. <br>
ODO: I hope you're well paid. It's a dangerous line of work. Trigger
the wrong security protocol, you could end up with permanent brain
damage. <br>
ARISSA: I think about that from time to time, but there's not much I
can do about it. You don't quit the Orion Syndicate unless they say you
can. <br>
ODO: Do you want to quit? <br>
ARISSA: That's why I came to meet Tauvid. <br>
ODO: Who was he? <br>
ARISSA: I don't know. <br>
ODO: Then why did you come meet him? <br>
ARISSA: He told me he had information. Information I could use to break
away from Draim, free and clear. <br>
ODO: What made you believe that he was telling the truth? <br>
ARISSA: I don't know. I just did. I'm not even sure how he knew I
wanted to get out. <br>
ODO: Did he tell you what this information was? <br>
ARISSA: No. But for some reason I decided to trust him. I know this
sounds insane. I guess I was desperate. <br>
ODO: Did you tell anyone you were coming here? <br>
ARISSA: No, but Draim must have monitored my communications. How else
could he have gotten his people here before I arrived. <br>
ODO: So you think Draim had Tauvid killed to stop you from getting this
crystal? <br>
ARISSA: And whoever he hired is probably still on the station. You can
be sure that Draim wants to know what's on that crystal as much as I
do. <br>
ODO: What are you smiling about? <br>
ARISSA: Oh, I'm just picturing myself trying to explain all this to the
authorities back on Finnea. Not that they'll listen. They'll just send
me to prison. <br>
ODO: I'm not turning this over to the Finneans. <br>
ARISSA: You're not? <br>
ODO: I'm placing you in protective custody while I have someone try to
access the crystal. In the meantime, I want you to have a look at
security recordings made at the airlocks. Draim was probably careful
not to send anyone you'd recognise, but you never know. <br>
ARISSA: Why are you doing this? <br>
ODO: Doing what? <br>
ARISSA: Helping me. <br>
ODO: Why not? <br>
ARISSA: You mean you're just doing it out of the kindness of your
heart? <br>
ODO: I don't have a heart. <br>
ARISSA: You could've fooled me.

ODO: I use these things to practise shape-shifting. <br>
ARISSA: These are your quarters? <br>
ODO: I thought this would be the last place anyone would look for you.
There's a bed in the other room. I was planning to stay out here so I
could keep an eye on you, if that's all right. <br>
ARISSA: I could use the company. <br>
ODO: I have two deputies stationed outside in the corridor, posing as a
maintenance crew doing repairs. <br>
ARISSA: And where are you going to sleep? <br>
ODO: I don't need a bed. I regenerate by reverting to a gelatinous
state. <br>
ARISSA: Sounds relaxing. <br>
ODO: It is, actually. <br>
ARISSA: I'm so tired I wouldn't mind being in a gelatinous state
myself. <br>
ODO: I understand you haven't been able to identify anyone from the
security recordings. <br>
ARISSA: No. <br>
ODO: I haven't had much luck identifying Tauvid either. It's not his
real name. He took three different transports to get to the station,
used a different identity each time. I've transmitted a picture of him
to the Idanian authorities. I'm not sure we'll get a reply. As you said
before, they're a very secretive race. <br>
ARISSA: What about the crystal? <br>
ODO: Dax and Chief O'Brien are still trying to get past the encryption
lockouts. <br>
ARISSA: I could try to interface with it. <br>
ODO: That's not a good idea. The first time they attempted to access
it, the feedback shorted out the computer. I'd hate to see what that
would do to your dataport. <br>
ARISSA: I can't believe what I got myself into. Walking out on Draim to
meet someone I don't even know? I must have been out of my mind. <br>
ODO: You said you were desperate. <br>
ARISSA: Why do you think I got involved with Draim in the first place? <br>
ODO: I know life on Finnea isn't easy, but you must have had other
options. <br>
ARISSA: Have you ever been there? <br>
ODO: No. <br>
ARISSA: It's not like a Federation world where everything is handed to
you. You know how I ended up with this? I was a netgirl. I told myself
I wasn't selling my body since there was no actual contact. But I was.
I let men into my mind for money. Draim was one of them. That's how we
first met. Before I knew it, I was working for him. He paid me more
than I'd ever seen before. I was so far removed from the consequences
of what I was doing, it was easy to pretend that I wasn't hurting
anyone. I'd hear things now and then. Some businessman Draim had me
investigate would disappear. I tried to convince myself it had nothing
to do with me. But after while I couldn't pretend anymore. I wanted
out. I guess I'm finally going to get my wish. Only problem is, I'll be
dead. I don't want to cry. The dead don't cry. <br>
ODO: Arissa, look at me. I'm not going to let anyone hurt you. You have
to trust me. <br>
ARISSA: I do trust you. But you can't protect me forever. Sooner or
later, Draim will get to me. I've got to find out what's on that
crystal. <br>
ODO: I don't think you can count on whatever's on that crystal to get
you out of this. <br>
ARISSA: If that's true, then I don't have a chance. <br>
ODO: Yes, you do. If you testified against Draim, you could put him in
prison for the rest of his life. You could get immunity for any past
crimes you may have committed, start a new life. <br>
ARISSA: Testify against Draim? I would never make it to the witness
stand. <br>
ODO: I will take personal responsibility for your safety. I don't care
how long it takes. If I have to ask for a leave of absence, I will. <br>
ARISSA: You'd do that for me? Why? <br>
ODO: I've done things in my life I'm not proud of, too. You worked for
Draim, I worked for the Cardassians. I never had the courage to walk
away. You did. I admire that. <br>
ARISSA: Wait a minute. You're going to have to give me a minute to get
used to this. I've never been admired for anything other than the way I
look. <br>
ODO: Most people can't see past the surface, especially when what they
see is so beautiful. I'm, I'm sorry, I merely meant <br>
ARISSA: Don't apologise. <br>
ODO: Well, I'm going to see if they've made any progress decoding the
crystal. Make yourself comfortable. I'll check in on you later. <br>

ODO: I can't. <br>
BASHIR: Why not? <br>
ODO: What if I? What if she? <br>
BASHIR: Rejects you? She might. But you can't go through life trying to
avoid getting a broken heart. If you do, it'll break from loneliness
anyway. So you might as well take a chance. If you don't, she'll move
on and you'll never know what you might have had. And living with that
is worse than having a broken heart, believe me. <br>
(A knock on the other window.) <br>
BASHIR: We're nearly finished, darling. <br>
(A gun jabs the back of Bashir's head.) <br>
O'BRIEN: Car trouble, Mister Bashir? Hi, Odo. <br>
ODO: I should go. Thank you, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: Odo. This isn't fair, Chief. Odo and I were talking. <br>
O'BRIEN: Didn't anyone ever tell you, you shouldn't stop for
hitchhikers.

ARISSA: Have you figured out who did it yet? <br>

curve right here. <br>
ODO: I tend to look a little different every day <br>
ARISSA: But you always manage to make these the same. <br>
ODO: I pay special attention to my scowl. An air of stern suspicion is
very important in my line of work. <br>
ARISSA: What? Why are you looking at me that way? <br>
ODO: I'm just trying to figure something out. <br>
ARISSA: Tell me. Maybe I can help. <br>
ODO: You're the first woman I've ever been close with. I've never been
able to let down my guard. I was just wondering what makes you
different. <br>
ARISSA: Wait a minute. Have you never been with anyone else before? <br>
ODO: Not with a humanoid. Once, on my homeworld, I had an experience
that you might consider sexual. <br>
ARISSA: But you've never been with a woman before? <br>
ODO: Could you tell? <br>
ARISSA: No. <br>
ODO: Good. I don't ever want to leave this room. Can we stay here
forever? <br>
ARISSA: I wish we could. <br>
ODO: Arissa? Everything is going to work out. <br>
ARISSA: I want to believe that, but I know what the Orion Syndicate
does to people who turn against them. I don't want to spend the rest of
my life looking over my shoulder. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought
it up. Let's just be together. <br>
ODO: All right. <br>
ARISSA: Tell me more about this encounter you had on your homeworld. <br>

WORF: Commander. <br>
KIRA: What makes you say that? <br>
DAX: Instinct. <br>
WORF: Jadzia. <br>

WORF: You asked to be told when the sensor array became available. <br>

later, right? <br>
KIRA: I suppose. <br>
WORF: You can begin your experiment at any time. <br>
DAX: I'm talking to Kira. <br>

ODO: That's impossible. She would have told me. <br>
IDANIAN: She doesn't know. <br>
ODO: I don't understand. <br>

previous memories were removed and stored on the datacrystal. If you

BASHIR: The memory transfer will take a few minutes. <br>
SISKO: How long was she undercover? <br>
IDANIAN: She volunteered for the operation two years ago. After we
altered her memories, we placed her on Finnea. She woke up the next
morning believing she was a different person. <br>
SISKO: With no memory of her former life as an intelligence agent? <br>
IDANIAN: That was crucial to the plan. Draim employs telepaths to scan
everyone who works for him. It was the only way to get past them. We
left her in place long enough to become a trusted member of Draim's
organisation. When we were ready to recall her, we had Tauvid make
contact. We'd imprinted a trace memory designed to make her feel she
could trust him. That way, she'd agree to meet. With what she knows
about Draim, we're going to be able to cripple his entire organisation.
As soon as she's debriefed, we plan to issue the indictments. <br>
ODO: You make it sound as if it all went according to plan. She was
nearly killed. <br>
IDANIAN: She knew the risks when she volunteered. We did everything we
could to minimise them. Every stage of this operation was meticulously
planned. <br>
ODO: Including what just happened in the cargo bay? <br>
SISKO: Why didn't you tell us what was going on when you found out
Tauvid had been killed? <br>
IDANIAN: If Draim's people had monitored the transmission, it would
have compromised the entire operation. We couldn't risk it. All that
matters is that she's safe and that Draim is going to prison for a long
time. <br>
BASHIR: The transfer's complete. I'm going to take her to surgery.
