in full swing, with Kim on clarinet. A crewman wheels&nbsp;an array of
different sized white-iced cakes on varying height stands past the
camera. Champagne is being served. Neelix approaches Seven and the EMH
with a silver tray of small packets.)<br>NEELIX: Are you sure this rice isn't supposed to be cooked? Steamed, fried? <br>
EMH: The idea is to shower the couple with a symbol of good fortune,
not garnish them like a roast chicken. Smile. <br>(He has his holo-imager with him, of course.)<br>
NEELIX: Rice, anyone? <br>CREWWOMAN: I'll take one.<br>(Chakotay enters in dress uniform, with Torres on his arm.)<br>NEELIX: (to Kim.) Red alert. <br>
KIM: Ready? <br>(The tune changes to Wagner's Bridal Chorus.) <br>
JANEWAY: This is it, Tom. Your bachelor days are over. <br>
PARIS: Not a moment too soon. <br>
JANEWAY: Second thoughts? <br>
PARIS: Second, third, fourth. <br>
EMH: I never thought I'd see the day. <br>
SEVEN: Given the volatile nature of their relationship, one might have
predicted homicide rather than matrimony. <br>
TUVOK: When it comes to affairs of the human heart, it is wise to look
beyond logic. <br>
JANEWAY: We're gathered here today, not as Starfleet officers, but as
friends and family, to celebrate the marriage of two of Voyager's
finest. B'Elanna has asked me to forego the rigours of Klingon painsticks in favour of a more traditional ceremony. <br>
KIM: They're saving the painsticks for the honeymoon. <br>
JANEWAY: As Captain, the honour of joining these two people has fallen
to me. But before I declare them husband and wife, Tom and B'Elanna
have prepared their own vows. <br>
PARIS: I still don't know what I've done to deserve you, But
whatever it is, I'll try to keep doing it. And I promise to stand by
you, to honour you, till death do us part. <br>
JANEWAY: Ensign? <br>
KIM: Hmm? <br>
JANEWAY: The ring. <br>
KIM: Oh. <br>
PARIS: May this ring be the symbol of our eternal love. <br>
TORRES: You stood by me when most people would have run for the nearest
airlock. You were willing to see past my shortcomings, and to take all
the bumps and bruises that came along with it. You made me a better
person, even though I put up one hell of a fight. I look forward to our
journey together. <br>
JANEWAY: Commander. &nbsp;<br>(Chakotay hands over the second ring to Torres.)<br>
TORRES: May this ring be the symbol of our eternal love. &nbsp;<br>(Paris leans in for the kiss.)<br>
JANEWAY: Not so fast. Lieutenant Thomas Eugene Paris, Lieutenant
B'Elanna Torres. With the power vested in my by Starfleet Command and
the United Federation of Planets, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Now, Tom. (the kiss.) Bravo. <br>(Torres tosses her bouquet over her shoulder, and Seven cannot avoid catching it.) <br>
EMH: Congratulations. <br>
SEVEN: For what? <br>
TUVOK: You may not want to know.<br>(The newlyweds leave in a cloud of rice. The deck ripples and the rice falls through.)

In this case the shortest path is a straight line. We'll pass right
through the centre of the Milky Way. <br>
JANEWAY: And be in sector zero zero one within two years? <br>
CHAKOTAY: More or less. <br>
JANEWAY: You had Seven double-check the calculations? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Two years, eleven days, six hours, provided we continue to
operate at peak efficiency. <br>
JANEWAY: Naturally. Of course, if we operate at peak efficiency, we'll
be missing some interesting phenomena along the way. An anomalous
gradient to the curvature of space, unusual bioharmonic readings from a
binary system we'll reach about six months from now. <br>
CHAKOTAY: And the scientist in you can't resist stopping to take a
look. <br>
JANEWAY: It would only add another two or three months. Do you think
the crew would mutiny? <br>
CHAKOTAY: On the contrary. Everyone'll jump at the chance for some
last-minute exploration. <br>
JANEWAY: Everyone, except Seven. <br>

Here's a lovely programme modelled after a mountain resort on the fifth
moon of
Cytax. Just you, B'Elanna, and the crickets. <br>
PARIS: Crickets? <br>
NEELIX: Cytaxian crickets. Their song is reputed to be an auditory
aphrodisiac. <br>
PARIS: Ah. Well, between you and me, B'Elanna and I don't need aphrodisiacs.
<br>
NEELIX: There's always the beaches of Ahmedeen. Windsurfing on a sea of
liquid argon. <br>
PARIS: I was hoping for some place a little more down to earth. <br>
NEELIX: Well, it's your honeymoon. Just how down to earth did you mean?
<br>
PARIS: Earth. I was thinking Chicago in the Roaring Twenties. Speakeasies,
flappers, the Charleston. <br>
NEELIX: If that's what you want. <br>
PARIS: Is there a problem? <br>
NEELIX: No, of course not. It's just that we're so close to Earth anyway, I thought you
might want to try something a little more exotic. <br>
PARIS: Let me let you in on a little secret, Neelix. Earth has the best
vacation spots in the galaxy. It's got the cultures, the climates, the
history, the people. It has everything you ever want in a planet. <br>
NEELIX: You sound like a travel brochure. <br>
PARIS: No, no. Just a native.

Oh, and make sure the deuterium manifolds are never opened wider than
six hundred microns. <br>
SEVEN: I am familiar with the specifications. <br>
TORRES: Are you familiar with how temperamental the isolitic converter
can be? <br>
SEVEN: Yes. <br>
TORRES: Most important, the enhanced warp drive. With the dilithium
matrix running hot all the time now, you have to watch it like a hawk. <br>
SEVEN: There is no point in providing me with knowledge I already
possess. <br>
TORRES: I guess I am being a little overcautious. I've just, er, never
been away from Engineering for more than a couple of days. Certainly
never a week. <br>
SEVEN: My engineering abilities are more than sufficient. Enjoy your
honeymoon. <br>
TORRES: You may understand the isodynamics of this engine, but I don't
think you understand its personality. <br>
SEVEN: Personality? It is a propulsion device. <br>
TORRES: That's my point. It's not just a device. It it has its own
quirks, its own, its own moods <br>(Beep!)<br>
SEVEN: That's just a minor fluctuation in a subsidiary injector port. I
will take care of it. <br>

SEVEN: I fail to see the benefit of monogamous relationships. <br>
TORRES: So you want to stay single? <br>
SEVEN: If you mean remain open to social situations with a wide variety
of individuals, then yes. <br>
TORRES: I'm married. I'm not going into stasis for the rest of my life.
No, I plan to have<br>
SEVEN: I do not wish to be dependent on anyone. By marrying, one limits
one's romantic interactions to a single individual, a circumstance
which implies extreme monotony. <br>
TORRES: I'm glad we had this little talk. <br>(The hatch refuses to open.)<br>TORRES:&nbsp;Try the manual release. <br>(They get the hatch open, and see the deck ahead rippling.)<br>TORRES: I

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Briefing

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TORRES:
It's our warp field. The enhanced drive is emitting some form of
subspace radiation that's affecting Voyager's infrastructure. <br>
TUVOK: It's beginning to break down the molecular bonds in all
surrounding sections. <br>
TORRES: We're seeing early stages of the effect in the warp core.
Reaction chamber, injector ports, they're all showing signs of
de-cohesion. <br>
KIM: It doesn't make any sense. We knew about the subspace radiation
and we ran dozens of simulations before we brought the new drive
online. <br>
JANEWAY: Have you tried taking the core offline? <br>
TORRES: It's not stopping the problem. <br>
JANEWAY: Try to isolate the cause of this, and stabilise the sections
that have already been affected. Dismissed. </font></p>

Computer, begin Chief Engineer's Log, supplemental. I've spent the last
four hours analysing the warp field schematics, but I'm still no closer
to finding out what's going wrong. Computer, did it just get colder in
here? <br>
COMPUTER: Negative. <br>
TORRES: Raise the temperature by five degrees. <br>(She goes into the bathroom, and sees a silver patch on her cheek.)

hands. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Doctor's office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Acute cellular degradation? <br>
EMH: Their chromosomes are breaking down at the molecular level. <br>
JANEWAY: Proximity to the warp field? <br>
EMH: I believe so. B'Elanna and my other three patients all work in
Engineering. They've been subjected to the heaviest exposure. But
preliminary scans suggest the rest of the crew has been affected as
well, including the Captain. It's only a matter of time before you
begin showing the same symptoms. <br>
JANEWAY: We've shut down the warp drive. The ship is still
deteriorating and so are we. Why?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Mess

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TUVOK:
Every bulkhead and conduit from deck one to fifteen show signs of
molecular de-cohesion. <br>
NEELIX: Even food from the replicator shows signs of decay. <br>
CHAKOTAY: As soon as anything comes into contact with Voyager's
atmosphere, it's affected. <br>
NEELIX: That's what we thought at first but take a look at this. These
vegetables are completely free of decay. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I thought you said the replicators<br>
NEELIX: They weren't replicated. I harvested them on an away mission
last week. The same goes for these particle accelerators, the
trilithium ore samples, the keg of Hazari ale. All of them were brought
aboard over the last few months, and none of them is disintegrating. <br>
TUVOK: We haven't been able to narrow the time frame precisely, but it
appears that anything brought on board over the past thirty to forty
weeks is immune. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Something happened to the ship months ago that's causing this
decay. <br>
TUVOK: A logical conclusion.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TUVOK:
Eight months, seventeen days ago, first contact with the Kmada. <br>
CHAKOTAY: They tried to sabotage our life-support systems with
low-frequency theta radiation. Any chance that could have caused the
phenomenon? <br>
TUVOK: Unlikely. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Let's keep looking. <br>
TUVOK: The next event of note took place nine months, two days ago when
the N'Kree tried to conscript Voyager into their battle fleet. <br>

TORRES: Tell me. <br>

beautiful downtown Chicago, circa 1928. Wait till you see it. Crystal
chandeliers, wall to wall Italian marble. We'll take a drive up
Michigan Avenue in a vintage Duesenberg, hobnob with the stars of the

EMH: Cortical stimulator. Initiate an iso-synaptic pulse. It's not
working. Again! Increase the electrolytic levels to seventy five
millijoules. We've lost her. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TUVOK:
Nine months, twenty eight days. We collected silicate from a comet in
the Podaris sector. <br>
CHAKOTAY: According to Neelix's manifest, those samples are stored in
the geology lab. They're showing no signs of molecular degradation.
Take us further back. <br>
TUVOK: Ten months, eleven days ago. Voyager was forced to land on a
class Y planetoid in the Vaskan sector. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The Demon class planet. One of our more interesting missions.
We set down looking for deuterium and ended up helping a new form of
life to be born. <br>
TUVOK: The planet possessed a biomimetic compound. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The silver blood. It sampled our DNA and created duplicates
of the entire crew. <br>
TUVOK: I've often wondered what happened to them. Are they flourishing? Have they continued to evolve? <br>

EMH: What's this about? <br>
TUVOK: We have a disturbing theory. <br>
EMH: I'm detecting all of those compounds. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I want you to inject her with a dichromate catalyst. <br>
EMH: Commander? <br>
CHAKOTAY: We've got to be sure. <br>(The EMH does so, and Torres dissolves into a silver liquid.)<br>
EMH: I don't understand. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That wasn't B'Elanna. It was a duplicate. A biomimetic copy. <br>
EMH: Copy? <br>
TUVOK: We are all duplicates. None of us are real. <br>(Later, Janeway is looking at a flask of silver liquid.)<br>EMH:
Behold the primordial soup. <br>
JANEWAY: That's what created us? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Not just us. The entire ship is composed of the same
material. <br>
EMH: It's a biomimetic compound that duplicated the crew's molecular
structure so precisely that I would never have detected it, if I hadn't
known what to look for. <br>
JANEWAY: I was born on Earth in Indiana. I remember growing up there. I
remember graduating from the Academy. I have no memory of being a copy.
<br>
EMH: Apparently, the original Kathryn Janeway's memories were
duplicated as well. Somehow, after the real Voyager left, we began to
forget we were duplicates. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Eventually, we assumed their lives and set a course for
Earth. <br>
JANEWAY: And now the warp core is breaking down our cellular structure.
We didn't think the radiation would hurt us because it isn't harmful to
humanoids. <br>
EMH: Each and every one of you will disintegrate just as B'Elanna did.
I'm not immune, either. The holo-emitters, like everything else, are
copies. It's only a matter of time before my programme begins to
degrade. <br>
JANEWAY: What can we do to stop the process? <br>
CHAKOTAY: There is one option. Go back. <br>
JANEWAY: To the Demon class planet? <br>
CHAKOTAY: We were created to survive there. <br>
TUVOK: He's correct. It's reasonable to assume that if we return to our
native environment, the degradation will cease. <br>
JANEWAY: Even if we survived the trip, we'd be travelling thousands of
light years in the wrong direction. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It may be the only way. <br>
JANEWAY: Duplicate or not, I'm still the same person I was yesterday and
so are all of you, and that means we're going to do everything possible
to complete our mission, which is to reach Earth. Is that clear? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes, ma'am. <br>
JANEWAY: I want you to adjust the environmental controls to simulate a
class Y planet. That should slow the rate of degradation. <br>
TUVOK: It's only a matter of time before the environmental controls
themselves are affected. <br>
JANEWAY: I realise that. That's why we're going to try and find a safe
harbour till we can figure out a way to stop the degradation. Scan for
the nearest class Y planet and set a course. In the meantime, I'll
explain our situation to the crew.

There's still a great deal we don't know about this phenomenon, and I
have every confidence we'll find a way to reverse it. <br>
KIM: So you're saying all our experiences before we were duplicated,
none of it's real? <br>
JANEWAY: I don't pretend to understand it myself, Harry, but the way I
choose to look at it is this. If everything about us was duplicated,
that includes our memory engrams, the emotional centres of our brain.
So if you feel something, remember something, believe something, I'm
not about to tell you it's not real. <br>
NEELIX: But there is another crew out there, right? The real Voyager. <br>
JANEWAY: I suppose there is, but I don't want that thought to distract
any of you from our mission. <br>
PARIS: What mission is that? <br>
JANEWAY: The same as it's always been, Tom. To reach the Alpha Quadrant
safe and sound. But to do that we're going to have to beat this problem,
and for now that means conserving energy, running the ship in grey
mode, cutting crew shifts in half. The less you exert yourselves, the
slower the cellular decay. Duplicates or not, you're still my crew.

to believe in ourselves. <br>

everything the Captain says anymore. Hell, she's not even the Captain. <br>

badly damaged. We need to set down on the surface to make repairs. <br>
ALIEN [OC]: We repeat. Leave or be destroyed. <br>
TUVOK: Shields down to fifty two percent. <br>
CHAKOTAY: With our systems degrading, we won't be able to take this much
longer. <br>
JANEWAY: Target their weapons systems. Fire. <br>
TUVOK: No effect. Hull breaches on decks eleven, fourteen and fifteen. <br>
KIM: The damaged sections are turning into biomimetic matter.
Containment fields are failing. <br>
JANEWAY: Evacuate those decks. <br>
TUVOK: If we emit a polaron burst, we can disable their shields long
enough to target their warp core. <br>
JANEWAY: No, we're not going to destroy them over a misunderstanding. <br>
TUVOK: Either that or retreat. <br>
JANEWAY: We're Starfleet officers, we can't forget that. Break orbit. <br>
PARIS: That planet may be our last chance for survival. <br>
JANEWAY: We'll have to find another option. <br>
PARIS: I'm not sure why we're still taking orders from you. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Lieutenant, follow orders or leave the bridge. <br>
TUVOK: The alien vessel's not pursuing. <br>
JANEWAY: Begin scanning for other class Y planets. Harry, transmit a
distress call on all subspace bands. If the real Voyager is out there, I
want to find them. <br>
PARIS: In the meantime, which direction do you want me to go? <br>
JANEWAY: Resume course for the Alpha Quadrant, Mister Paris.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
I know what you're going to say and I don't want to hear it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Too bad. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm willing to take a little insolence from Tom, but I
shouldn't have to remind you that I'm still the Captain. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You're not. You're a biomimetic lifeform created in her
image. <br>
JANEWAY: Are you saying you're not taking orders from me anymore? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm saying you need to step back and look at our situation
objectively. <br>
JANEWAY: You think I should have given the order to fire on that
vessel. <br>
CHAKOTAY: No, I agreed with your decision to stand down. But how long
can we adhere to Starfleet principles before we start making
compromises? <br>
JANEWAY: As long as it takes. Our ship may be deteriorating, but our
humanity is intact. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Belief alone won't hold this ship together. <br>
JANEWAY: It's gotten us this far. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Not far enough. Tom and I aren't the only ones who question
your decisions. Now that the truth is known, a lot of people think we
should turn around and head for the class Y planet. They're starting to
remember their existence before Voyager. <br>
JANEWAY: What, what existence? Pools of biomimetic fluid? We didn't
even experience sentience until Voyager came along. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What good is sentience if we're not alive to experience it?
Kathryn, we've got to go back. <br>
JANEWAY: I promised the crew I'd get them home. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Home isn't Earth. <br>(Chakotay's face ripples.)<br>

We've lost Commander Chakotay. Duplicate or not, he was real to me and
he was a fine Starfleet officer. And he was a friend who wasn't afraid
to let me know when I am wrong. Mister Kim, bring the enhanced warp
drive online. Turn Voyager around. We're going home. <br>

We've lost the Doctor. <br>
JANEWAY: What's Tom's condition? <br>
KIM: No change. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, looks like we're in the market for a new medical
officer. Feel up to it, Neelix? <br>
NEELIX: I've only been trained as a field medic. <br>
JANEWAY: It'll have to do. <br>
NEELIX: What about my other duties? <br>
JANEWAY: Make Sickbay your priority. At this point morale is a luxury.
How's the core holding up? <br>
SEVEN: The modified nanoprobes are still reinforcing the warp field. It
should remain functioning until we reach the Demon Planet. However,
there is less than a twenty percent probability that Voyager will
remain intact that long. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, it won't be the first time this crew has been up against
<br>
KIM: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: It's all right, I'm just a little tired. <br>
NEELIX: Let Ensign Kim take command for a little while. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm still the Captain. <br>
NEELIX: And I am the Chief Medical Officer. Don't force me to relieve
you of your duties. <br>
JANEWAY: Your concerns have been noted, sir. Now, there is another
matter. I want to download the ship's database and our personal logs
into a signal beacon. In the event we don't survive, there should be
some record of our accomplishments. <br>
KIM: A time capsule. <br>
JANEWAY: This crew's existence may have been brief, but it's been
distinguished. None of you deserves to be forgotten. <br>
SEVEN: I will use unaffected components to construct a beacon.

<br>
JANEWAY: Purge it. <br>
SEVEN: I can't. The exhaust manifolds have disintegrated. <br>
JANEWAY: We've come too far to be stopped by dust. Reroute auxiliary
power to the deflector. <br>
SEVEN: Warp field failure in eight, seven, six, five, four, three <br>
KIM: Got it. <br>
SEVEN: Reinitialising the deflector. The warp field has stabilised. <br>
NEELIX: I may not be morale officer anymore, but I think this is a cause
for celebration. What do you say, Captain? Captain? <br>(Neelix scans Janeway.)<br>NEELIX: She's gone.
