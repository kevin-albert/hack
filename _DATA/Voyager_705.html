54208.3. Last month's datastream from Starfleet never arrived, so the
crew is looking forward to this one with even more anticipation than
usual. We could all use some news from home. </font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
There he is. The man of the hour. <br>
KIM: You sure are in a good mood. <br>
PARIS: Well, rumour has it you snared the latest datastream last
night. <br>
KIM: Technically, it was this morning. Oh two hundred, to be exact. <br>
PARIS: So, where's my mail, hmm? Oh, don't tell me you lost another one. <br>
KIM: I didn't lose last month's datastream. It never arrived.<br>
PARIS: So what's the hold up this time? <br>
KIM: The transmission was a little larger than usual. It's jammed the
transceivers. Seven and I have been up all night trying to download it.
<br>
PARIS: Harry, we can't go another month without mail. <br>
KIM: Oh, you won't. Trust me.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM: Any
luck? <br>
SEVEN: I've determined why we've been having difficulties.<br>
KIM: A hologram. The transceiver wasn't designed to store photonic
data. We have to get it out of there before it degrades.<br>
SEVEN: What are you doing? <br>
KIM: Tying the transceiver into the holodeck's pattern buffer. <br>
SEVEN: Those systems aren't compatible. You'll depolarise the relays. <br>
KIM: Starfleet wouldn't have sent this hologram if it weren't
important. I'm sure it's worth a few burnt-out relays. <br>(Bang! goes a console.)<br>
SEVEN: You've overloaded the transceiver. <br>
KIM: But I saved the hologram. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Holodeck]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM:
Okay, ready when you are. <br>(The hologram appears.)<br>
JANEWAY: Lieutenant Barclay? <br>
REG: Er, no, but he did design me. I'm a walking, talking,
problem-solving interactive hologram. You can call me Reg.<br>
JANEWAY: It's nice to meet you, Reg. <br>
REG: The pleasure's mine, Captain. Harry, Seven. I've been
looking forward to working with you. <br>
KIM: You have? <br>
REG: I know, you were expecting letters from your friends and
families. But with any luck, in a few days you'll be seeing them face
to face. In three days' time, Voyager is going to be passing through
grid eight nine eight, a sector of space occupied by a red giant star. <br>
JANEWAY: Sensors detected it a few days ago. <br>
REG: At this very moment, a team of Federation scientists is
orbiting another red giant in the Alpha Quadrant. In seventy two hours,
they will target its magnetic field with a verteron beam, creating a
geodesic fold. As a result, a corresponding fold will open here in the
magnetic field of the red giant that Voyager is approaching. Space will
be punctured at these two points, creating a gateway between the Quadrants.<br>
JANEWAY: Our shields are useless against geodesic radiation. We toyed
with the idea of opening a fold ourselves, but it didn't take us long to
realise we wouldn't survive the trip. <br>
REG: A lot's happened in geodesic research since you've been
gone. I've brought schematics for shield upgrades to deflect the
radiation from the fold. Medical technology to provide additional
protection for the crew. We've thought of everything.<br>
SEVEN: Starfleet never mentioned you in any of the previous datastreams. <br>
REG: Well, Lieutenant Barclay didn't want to raise your hopes
in case the plan didn't live up to expectations. But lucky for you, it
surpassed them. <br>
JANEWAY: What about last month's datastream? Why didn't we receive it?
<br>
REG: Pathfinder tried sending an unabridged version of my
programme. It overloaded the MIDAS array.<br>
KIM: The only casualty this time was our transceiver. <br>
REG: If everything goes according to plan, you won't need it
anymore. <br>
JANEWAY: If we were to attempt this, you'd need access to areas of this
ship that aren't equipped with holo-emitters. <br>
REG: Not to worry, Captain. We've thought of that too. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: My
emitter is your emitter. <br>(The EMH puts the mobile emitter onto Reg's sleeve.)<br>
JANEWAY: Computer, transfer the Barclay hologram to the mobile emitter.
<br>
COMPUTER: Transfer complete. <br>
REG: On Lieutenant Barclay's behalf, I thank you. <br>
EMH: Just make sure to return it when we get to Earth. Ha, ha, ha.<br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: We're ready for you in the briefing room, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Excuse us, Doctor. <br>
EMH: I'm sure you have a full day planned, but if you have time, I'd
like to get better acquainted. <br>
REG: I'll stop by the first chance I get. <br>
EMH: You'll know where to find me. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">REG:
This is our destination, red giant two three one three nine. The
geodesic fold will open here, adjacent to the giant's northern pole.
We'll have exactly sixteen seconds to take Voyager through. <br>
JANEWAY: Reg has prepared a list of assignments. I expect you to give
him your full cooperation. <br>
REG: Mister Paris, you have the honour of plotting our course
to Big Red Two. Lieutenant Torres, Commander Tuvok, I'd like you to
start working on shield modifications. And in the meantime, I've asked
the Doctor to prepare a series of inoculations that will protect the
crew from the radiation. <br>
SEVEN: We should discuss the possibility of applying Borg technology to
Starfleet's plan. It could increase our chances of success. <br>
REG: I look forward to hearing your thoughts. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How long before the transceiver's back online? <br>
KIM: No more than two hours. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Then we'll still have time to transmit a response to
Starfleet. <br>
JANEWAY: Keep us posted. I'd like to send Lieutenant Barclay a little
thank you note for all his hard work.<br>
NEELIX: Is there anything I can do, Reg? <br>
REG: Your job might be the most important one of all. The next
few days will be difficult. The crew will be working extremely long
hours. They're going to need an experienced morale officer to keep
their spirits high. <br>
NEELIX: You can count on me. <br>
REG: If this were any other ship, I'd have my doubts. But this
is Voyager, the Miracle Ship. You've survived six years in the Delta
Quadrant. You've evaded the Kazon, the Vidiians, the Hirogen, you've
even faced down the Borg. I think, with a little teamwork, we can pull
off one more miracle and take Voyager home. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM: I
can taste my mom's cooking. <br>
PARIS: Don't forget what the hologram said, Harry. This is Voyager. <br>
KIM: The Miracle Ship. <br>
PARIS: Not when it comes to getting us home. Our shortcuts have a
tendency to blow up in our faces. <br>
KIM: That's looking on the bright side. <br>
PARIS: Remember Arturis and his quantum slipstream drive? Or how about
the telepathic pitcher plant that made us think we were on our way home
right before it tried to eat the ship? <br>
KIM: This is the best opportunity we've had. <br>
PARIS: Yeah, which is why we'll probably end up in the Gamma Quadrant. <br>
KIM: I'll remind you of that when we get back to Earth. <br>
PARIS: Don't say I didn't warn you. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
When a Borg Cube enters a transwarp conduit, it's subject to extreme
gravimetric shear. To compensate, the Borg project a structural
integrity field ahead of the Cube. By modifying Voyager's deflector, we
may be able to do the same.<br>
REG: No one at Starfleet would have thought of this. So,
what's the first thing you're going to do when you get back? <br>
SEVEN: Begin repairs to Voyager. Even with the structural integrity
field, it's likely the ship will suffer significant damage. <br>
REG: Yes, of course, but there are people at Utopia
Planitia who will take care of that. There are Engineering crews and
technicians. <br>
SEVEN: Are you implying that I'm superfluous? <br>
REG: Of course not. I only meant that, if you're too busy
working, you're going to miss all the welcome home hoopla. Starfleet's
planning parties, ceremonies and speeches. There's, there's a
ticker-tape parade down Market Street. <br>
SEVEN: I won't be attending any of those events. <br>
REG: But, you'd be the guest of honour. <br>
SEVEN: When I first arrived on Voyager, it was difficult for the crew to
accept me. I'm anticipating a similar welcome on Earth. <br>
REG: You don't have any idea, do you? I didn't mention this
earlier. I didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings. You are the one who
people are most looking forward to seeing. <br>
SEVEN: That's difficult to believe. <br>
REG: Why? <br>
SEVEN: I was Borg. <br>
REG: Exactly. You were Borg. But you escaped, and despite
incredible odds, you managed to reclaim your humanity. No one's ever
done that before. You're famous. <br>
SEVEN: Fame is irrelevant.<br>
REG: Maybe. But you've given hope to everyone who's ever lost
somebody to the Borg. You've inspired millions. <br>
SEVEN: If you think my participation in the hoopla would be beneficial
to others, then I'll comply.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">HARKINS:
Is this going to take much longer, Reg? <br>
BARCLAY: Well, the computer is still inputting data. That should do it.
Right. Computer, display the intended trajectory of the datastream
transmitted at oh six hundred this morning. Now, display the actual
trajectory, and identify the termination point. <br>
COMPUTER: The trajectory ends in sector three nine five. <br>
BARCLAY: Four two, grid eight. Does that sound familiar? That's exactly
where the datastream dissipated last month. There is something there.
There is something preventing the datastream from reaching Voyager.
Er, a micro-wormhole, a radiogenic field.<br>
HARKINS: Long range scans didn't pick up anything unusual. <br>
BARCLAY: Still, we could send a ship to investigate. We could confirm
my theory. <br>
HARKINS: What about my theory, Reg? The hologram was too complex. It
caused the datastreams to degrade before they reached their
destination. <br>
BARCLAY: Well, to be honest I, I don't agree. The truth is, we don't
know what happened to my hologram. <br>
HARKINS: Then let's stick to what we do know. For the second month in a
row, we tried sending your hologram to Voyager. And for the second month
in a row, it failed to get there. <br>
BARCLAY: And I want to know why, so it doesn't happen a third time. <br>
HARKINS: It won't happen a third time. Next month we go back to
standard transmissions. <br>
BARCLAY: But a holographic matrix carries twice the information, interact with the crew. <br>
HARKINS: Admiral Paris wants us to send more practical data, like
tactical upgrades, letters from the crew's families.<br>
BARCLAY: But, Pete. <br>
HARKINS: Sending a hologram to Voyager was a good idea but it didn't
work. It's time to move on. <br>(Next day, Harkins is escorting a group of schoolchildren.)<br>HARKINS:
And this is the research lab where most of Pathfinder's homework gets
done. All the datastreams are compressed here and then transmitted all
the way to the Delta Quadrant. Your teacher tells me you've been
studying some of the Delta Quadrant races that Voyager's described to
us. Who can name one for me? <br>
GIRL 1: The Talaxians. <br>
HARKINS: Very good. <br>
GIRL 2: The Ocampa. <br>
HARKINS: That's right. Who else? <br>
BARCLAY: The Borg! The Borg! They assimilated my hologram. That's how
it disappeared. <br>
HARKINS: Reg, now isn't the time. <br>
BARCLAY: Look at this. Last month, a spacecraft passed within twenty
metres of the MIDAS array just hours before we sent the first hologram.
<br>
HARKINS: What is your point? <br>
BARCLAY: Twenty metres. It's awfully close, don't you think? <br>
HARKINS: Ensign. <br>(The Ensign ushers the schoolchildren out of the lab.)<br>
BARCLAY: The Borg must have sent a transwarp probe to steal my
hologram. Maybe because they, they thought that it was carrying
anti-Borg technology to Voyager.<br>
HARKINS: It wasn't the Borg, Reg. <br>
BARCLAY: Then it was the Romulans using a cloaked ship.
They've been curious about Voyager for years. <br>
HARKINS: That is enough. <br>
BARCLAY: But, you <br>
HARKINS: I am sorry your idea didn't work, but I can't have you going
off on a tangent. Not again. You'll be no good to Pathfinder or
Voyager. How much leave do you have saved up? <br>
BARCLAY: Not that much. Fifty, maybe sixty days. <br>
HARKINS: Take a week. Go home. Try to relax. <br>
BARCLAY: But, Pete! <br>
HARKINS: No! That was not a request, Lieutenant. <br>
BARCLAY: Maybe I'll go somewhere. Take a vacation. <br>
HARKINS: Now that is the most sensible thing I've heard you say all
day. My cousin has a beach house in Malaysia. She'd be happy to lend it
to you. <br>
BARCLAY: Thanks, er, but I have someplace else in mind. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">REG:
You, you wanted to see me? <br>
EMH: I've been going over the instructions from Starfleet Medical. As
far as I can tell, their new inoculations aren't much different from
run-of-the-mill radiogenic vaccines. I don't think they'll protect the
crew. <br>
REG: Did you try incorporating the synthetic antigen? <br>
EMH: Yes, but it only improved the resistance by ten percent.<br>
REG: That should be enough. <br>
EMH: We can't afford to be cavalier, Reg. If these treatments don't
work, the crew will wind up liquefied. <br>
REG: You're forgetting that the inoculations aren't designed
to work alone. They were intended to work in combination with the
shield modifications. It's the medicinal ying to the shield's yang. <br>
EMH: And what if the yang doesn't work? <br>
REG: That's not going to happen. Now, listen. Lieutenant
Barclay has a special affinity for this crew. So do I. I promise you,
we won't let them down. <br>
EMH: Of course you won't. Tell me, do you also share Lieutenant
Barclay's affinity for golf? <br>
REG: We have identical handicaps. <br>
EMH: Well, if you're not busy later, perhaps we can play nine holes on
the holodeck. <br>
REG: It's tempting, but I still have a few dozen progress
reports to look over. <br>
EMH: In that case, maybe you could look over them here so that I could
borrow the mobile emitter. <br>

mean.<br>

hologram but you can't bring yourself to admit it. That's why you're
projecting your suspicions onto others. You're in denial. If there's

wrong. <br>

You were correct, Admiral. The Ferengi did steal Reg's hologram. Twice.
This is the ship you need to look for.<br>(Troi hands over a PADD. Later, that ship is on the screen.)<br>LEOSA:
That's it. That's Nunk's ship. <br>
HARKINS: Nunk? <br>

HARKINS: Scans indicate they've been in the vicinity of that star for
the last forty three hours. Why? <br>
LEOSA: I don't know. <br>
TROI: She's telling the truth. For once. <br>
ADMIRAL PARIS: The Ferengi wouldn't have stolen the hologram if they
didn't think it was valuable. They're probably waiting to rendezvous
with a buyer. Are there any Starfleet ships in that area? <br>
HARKINS: The Carolina's point seven light years away. At maximum warp
it could reach them in two hours. <br>
ADMIRAL PARIS: Open a channel. <br>
HARKINS: Computer, open a secure channel to the Carolina. <br>
ADMIRAL PARIS: Tell Captain Peterson to adjust his course immediately. <br>

LEOSA: Not everything. Just the parts where I expressed affection for
you. <br>

business. <br>
BARCLAY: What exactly is a broken heart worth these days, hmm?<br>

EMH: It's disrespectful. <br>
JANEWAY: What do you want me to do, deactivate him? <br>
EMH: Just long enough to run a diagnostic of his programme. His recent
behaviour may be indicative of a more serious problem. <br>
JANEWAY: I haven't seen any evidence of that. <br>
EMH: Of course not. In front of you he's all smiles. But I've seen him
be rude and careless. Two traits the real Lieutenant Barclay never
exhibited. <br>
JANEWAY: I know the real Barclay is a friend of yours, and I'm sorry if
the holographic version hasn't lived up to your expectations, but
that's hardly reason to deactivate him. <br>
EMH: Are the lives of a hundred and fifty crewmen reason enough? Maybe
you're right. Maybe I am overreacting. But what if I'm right? We're
less than a light year away from the geodesic fold. Do you want to risk
being led through it by a malfunctioning hologram? </font></p>

Why are you hiding in the corner? <br>
BARCLAY: I'm not hiding. I'm working on a way to foil the Ferengi's'
plans.<br>
TROI: Reg, there's nothing left to foil. The Carolina will have them in
custody within the hour. <br>
BARCLAY: Leosa said the Ferengi were going to be selling Borg
nanoprobes. <br>
TROI: What does that have to do with Voyager?<br>
BARCLAY: They have a Borg crewman. Think about it. The Ferengi stole
the original Barclay hologram a month ago. That gave them time to
reprogramme it and then smuggle it to Voyager in the next transmission. <br>
TROI: Reprogramme it to do what? <br>
BARCLAY: Steal Seven of Nine's nanoprobes. For all we know&nbsp;he could
be dissecting her right now. <br>
TROI: What would the Ferengi want with assimilation technology? <br>
BARCLAY: Oh, nanoprobes aren't just for assimilating. They can
reanimate necrotic tissue, slow down the aging process. They'd be
priceless for the Ferengi. <br>
TROI: Reg, even if the Ferengi did reprogramme your hologram to steal the
nanoprobes, how would they get their hands on them? Voyager's thirty
thousand light years away. <br>
BARCLAY: I haven't figured that part out yet. Maybe they discovered a
wormhole, or a subspace corridor. <br>
TROI: Have you mentioned any of this to Commander Harkins? <br>
BARCLAY: Not yet. I can't. If I don't bring him hard evidence, he'll
just think that I'm
fantasising. For the time being, we need to keep this between us.
