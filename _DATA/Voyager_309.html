<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> NEELIX:
Mister Tuvok! Mister Tuvok! I was supposed to accompany you on security
rounds this morning. Did you forget? <br>
TUVOK: I was not aware that we had a definite appointment. <br>
NEELIX: I'm sure it was definite. Well, maybe not completely definite.
That is, I, I'd expressed my desire to learn the ropes as it were, and
I have completed my study of starship security protocols. I think
you'll find that I'm fully qualified to serve in the capacity of a
Starfleet security officer. Junior grade, of course. <br>
TUVOK: If you recall, Mister Neelix, I did not guarantee you a
position. <br>
NEELIX: But Captain Janeway is always saying that Voyager is a ship of
opportunity. <br>
TUVOK: That is true, but opportunities for promotion on a starship must
be earned. <br>
NEELIX: I've been working hard at this. I really do feel I have a great
deal to contribute to Voyager beyond my current role. <br>
TUVOK: Your dedication is duly noted, Mister Neelix. Now if you'll
excuse me, I am due on the bridge. <br>
NEELIX: I'll see you first thing tomorrow morning for security rounds! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
Ensign Vorik. Get me a duotronic probe, I'm having trouble regulating
the plasma flow. <br>
(Vorik is a Vulcan.) <br>
VORIK: May I suggest a gravitic caliper instead? You might find it a
more precise instrument. <br>
TORRES: Good idea, but bring me both. <br>
NEELIX: Good morning, B'Elanna. You missed my special Klingon Breakfast
Buffet. <br>
TORRES: I'm sorry Neelix, but a bowl of cold gagh is not my idea of how
to start a morning. <br>
NEELIX: Well, you're not alone. None of the crew seemed especially
enthusiastic about it. What's the problem with er, the plasma
injectors? I've been getting myself up to speed on Federation warp
propulsion. <br>
TORRES: The plasma flow in the manifold seems to be constricted. <br>
NEELIX: Ah. Have you thought of phase locking them to the dilithium
matrix? <br>
TORRES: That was the first thing I did. <br>
NEELIX: Oh. I really am interested in learning more about engineering
systems, maybe even volunteering for a few duty shifts. In fact, I have
a couple of questions about the impulse response filters. <br>
TORRES: Neelix, Neelix, this really isn't a good time. <br>
NEELIX: Oh. I understand, Lieutenant. Sorry. I'll just watch for a
while, if you don't mind. <br>
VORIK: Here are the tools, sir. <br>
NEELIX: I also had a question about the transporter buffers. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Mister Neelix, please report to the bridge. <br>
NEELIX: On my way, Captain. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Neelix, we seem to be approaching some kind of interstellar
dust clouds. Can you tell us anything about them? They look rather
ominous to me. <br>
NEELIX: I believe this is a region of space known as the Nekrit
Expanse. <br>
(The dust clouds are purple.) <br>
JANEWAY: What can you tell us about this Expanse, Mister Neelix? <br>
NEELIX: It's a vast territory. No one knows much about it. <br>
JANEWAY: Those plasma storms might be a problem for navigation. Full
sensor scan, Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Can we plot a course around it? <br>
NEELIX: That might be advisable. <br>
TUVOK: I don't believe so. It's thousands of light years wide. <br>
JANEWAY: Then we'll have to go through it. Looks like we'll be counting
on your knowledge of the Delta quadrant even more than usual, Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: Yes, ma'am. I'm at your command, as always. <br>
JANEWAY: Will there be any planets where we can take on supplies? <br>
NEELIX: There is a station near the border, a kind of supply depot for
mining and trading ships. I suggest we stop there for provisions before
we go into the Nekrit Expanse. <br>
JANEWAY: What are the coordinates? <br>
NEELIX: Er, let's see. It's actually been a while. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I have the station on sensors, Captain. Three point four
light years away, heading oh seven one mark one seven. <br>
JANEWAY: You heard him, Tom. <br>
PARIS: On our way. <br>
(Later -) <br>
TUVOK: We're being hailed, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Federation
Starship Voyager. <br>
BAHRAT [on viewscreen]: Bahrat, manager of this station. What can I do
for you? <br>
(He doesn't look up from monitoring different screens.) <br>
JANEWAY: Your station is a trading outpost, isn't it? I'd like
permission to come aboard to negotiate for supplies. <br>
(Now he looks up.) <br>
BAHRAT [on viewscreen]: Granted. But understand that any transaction
you negotiate on this station is subject to my approval. I receive a
twenty percent commission on all trade. Your whereabouts will be
closely monitored. Communications with your ship may also be monitored,
at my discretion. Do you agree to these conditions? <br>
JANEWAY: Evidently I have no choice <br>
BAHRAT [on viewscreen]: Excellent. Meet me in my office in one hour and
we'll discuss your needs. <br>
(Transmission ends.) <br>
PARIS: Pleasant fellow. <br>
JANEWAY: Neelix, Chakotay, Tom. You're with me. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Mister Bahrat? <br>
BAHRAT: What is it? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm Kathryn Janeway. I've brought a list of the supplies we'll
need. <br>
BAHRAT: Forgive me, but it's demanding work watching over this station.
We get all kinds of troublemakers here. <br>
JANEWAY: I understand. <br>
BAHRAT: All right, let's see it. Hmm. Hmm mmm. Hmm! Pergium. <br>
JANEWAY: To regenerate the filters on our environmental control system.
<br>
BAHRAT: That might be a little difficult. It's a rare commodity. Give
me a few moments and I'll put together a list of potential suppliers.
But I'll warn you, they won't strike easy bargains. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm prepared to deal fairly. <br>
BAHRAT: Hmm. </font></p>

and Chakotay are approached by a grey-faced alien with downturned
mouth, wearing a robe with a hood.) <br>
SUTOK: Good day, gentlemen, good day. Anything in particular you're
looking for? Anything I can help you with? <br>
CHAKOTAY: We were hoping to find some magnetic spindle bearings for our
reaction control assembly. <br>
SUTOK: Spindle bearing, spindle bearings. No, can't help you with that.
No. Long voyage ahead? <br>
PARIS: Er, you could say that. <br>
SUTOK: I might have something that could ease your journey. Ease it
considerably. Rhuludian crystals. Ingesting just one of these will make
days of tedious travel seem like moments of exquisite rapture. <br>
PARIS: No, thank you. <br>
SUTOK: The price is surprisingly <br>
CHAKOTAY: No. <br>
PARIS: Nice place. <br>
(Elsewhere, Neelix approaches a slightly more humanoid person.) <br>
NEELIX: I see you're a map dealer. <br>
MAP DEALER: I have coordinate charts for all the local mining colonies.
<br>
NEELIX: Actually, I'm interested in maps of the Nekrit Expanse. <br>
MAP DEALER: You must be a stranger here or you'd know. There aren't any
maps of that region. <br>
NEELIX: Surely there's an astrometric chart or a database that would
help me plot a safe course? <br>
MAP DEALER: The Nekrit Expanse is too unstable to chart. <br>
(Another Talaxian joins them.) <br>
WIXIBAN: No matter. He never could plot a straight course anyway. <br>
NEELIX: Wixiban? Wix, is that you? I can't believe it! <br>
WIXIBAN: What are you doing here? I've never seen another Talaxian this
far from home. <br>
NEELIX: It's a long story. I'm one of the crew of a highly advanced
starship. <br>
WIXIBAN: Ah! I want to hear all about it. Come on, the tavern here
serves the best toffa ale I've had in years. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Station
tavern]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> NEELIX:
I do a little of everything. Cook, guide, advisor to the Captain,
possibly even an unofficial Ambassador. <br>
WIXIBAN: Oh ho, ho. Life's been good to you. <br>
NEELIX: Yes, I'm very, I'm very lucky. But what about you? What are you
doing on this station? <br>
WIXIBAN: A little of this, a little of that. To tell you the truth,
things haven't gone quite so well for me. <br>
NEELIX: I'm sorry. <br>
WIXIBAN: Ever since that nasty business with the Ubeans, things have
been difficult. But, you know me, can't keep Wix down long. I'm working
on a trade deal now that should put me right back in the thick of
things again. <br>
NEELIX: I hope it works out. Er, Wix, about the Ubeans. I don't think I
ever told you how much I valued what you did. <br>
WIXIBAN: You'd have done the same for me. <br>
NEELIX: Yes, I would have. But you were the one who got caught. I owe
you a great deal. If there's anything I can do to help. <br>
WIXIBAN: I'm fine, honestly. Maybe not on the crew of a magnificent
starship, but I'll get by. <br>
NEELIX: To tell you the truth, it's not quite what I told you. In fact
I may not be on Voyager much longer. <br>
WIXIBAN: Why? <br>
NEELIX: The main reason Captain Janeway needed me was as a guide, to
give her information about this quadrant. But I've never been beyond
the Nekrit Expanse. I can't tell her anything about what's ahead. <br>
WIXIBAN: But, your other jobs. Cook, Ambassador. <br>
NEELIX: They don't really need a cook, and I don't think our Captain
really requires an Ambassador. I've tried to find some other area where
I might be useful, but, the truth is, I'm not needed. I'm hoping you
can help me. I can't let Voyager go into that dangerous without some
idea of what's there. I have to find a map. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Mess
hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Neelix
drops a pan of something.) <br>
VORIK: Can I be of help, Mister Neelix? <br>
NEELIX: Dinner isn't for an hour, Ensign Vorik, and I don't have time
to prepare a snack. <br>
VORIK: I don't require food at the moment. Lieutenant Torres sent me to
adjust the control interface on your food replicators. You said you
were experiencing difficulties with them. <br>
NEELIX: Oh, of course. Go ahead. <br>
(Chakotay enters with Wixiban.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Neelix. I thought you'd like to say hello to your old friend.
<br>
NEELIX: Well, er, yes. Yes, of course. <br>
WIXIBAN: So, this is where you prepare your legendary feasts. You know,
Commander, Neelix has more varied talents than anyone I've ever known.
You're lucky to have him on board. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Mister Wix was able to find those magnetic spindle bearings
we were looking for. I don't know what we'd have done if he hadn't come
up them. <br>
NEELIX: Well, yes, Wix has always had a knack for finding those hard to
locate items. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'll let you two reminisce for a while. Thanks again, Wix. <br>
WIXIBAN: You're more than welcome. <br>
(Chakotay leaves.) <br>
NEELIX: Yes, this is the Mess room. On any given day I must be prepared
to feed over a hundred people. About done, Ensign? <br>
VORIK: Not quite. <br>
NEELIX: Well I really don't need the replicators today, so you can
finish later. <br>
VORIK: As you wish. <br>
NEELIX: Oh, and remind Lieutenant Torres. When she has a moment, I'd
still like to go over a few things with her. <br>
VORIK: I'll relay the message. <br>
NEELIX: Thank you. <br>
(Vorik leaves.) <br>
NEELIX: Wix, please tell me those spindle bearings weren't stolen
property. <br>
WIXIBAN: Of course not. I wouldn't do that to you. Neelix, I need the
work. I don't live on a comfortable starship. No one looks out for me
except me. Maybe you've forgotten what that feels like. <br>
NEELIX: I haven't forgotten. <br>
WIXIBAN: I've been stuck on that trash heap of a space station for
three years. My ship's been impounded. I can't afford to give Bahrat
what he wants to get it back. Do you begrudge me an opportunity to make
a fair trade? <br>
NEELIX: Of course not. <br>
WIXIBAN: I have news for you. I've located some pergium for your ship. <br>
NEELIX: That's great news. Captain Janeway hasn't had any luck. <br>
WIXIBAN: And I've found someone with a map. <br>
NEELIX: Wonderful! How do we get it? <br>
WIXIBAN: It'll involve several bartering sessions. I have the
opportunity to sell medical supplies to an outpost whose people are
dying of a lung disease. It's a good cause, and it will make me enough
to pay Bahrat and get my ship back. <br>
NEELIX: Where does the map come in? <br>
WIXIBAN: When I deliver the medical supplies, one of the physicians
will give me an astrometric chart. <br>
NEELIX: I can't thank you enough. <br>
WIXIBAN: I'll have to ask your help though. We'll need a shuttle.
First, we have to get to a nearby freighter to pick up the medical
supplies. Then we return to the space station and meet with one of the
physicians from the outpost. With your transporter technology we could
be in and out of the station within minutes. Then I could finally get
away from here and get back to a Talaxian colony. <br>
NEELIX: I don't think that would be a problem. <br>
WIXIBAN: Just one thing. Don't tell anyone that we're delivering
medical supplies to the station. Not even one person. If Bahrat finds
out he'll take twenty percent, and I can't afford that. <br>
NEELIX: I suppose there's no need to mention it. <br>
WIXIBAN: Thanks, Neelix. I knew I could count on you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Shuttlecraft]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
WIXIBAN: Didn't I tell you this would be easy? I got the medical
supplies and you got the pergium your ship needs so badly. <br>
NEELIX: Only twenty kilogrammes. I told Commander Chakotay it would be
forty five. <br>
WIXIBAN: You're lucky to get what you did. Come on, Neelix, A few
minutes more and we'll be done. And you'll have a map to help you
through the Nekrit Expanse. What is the matter with you? <br>
NEELIX: I don't like keeping the whole truth from Commander Chakotay.
It's not honest. <br>
WIXIBAN: I don't remember you ever being so squeamish about twisting
the truth. <br>
NEELIX: Wix, I'm not what I used to be. <br>
WIXIBAN: Neither am I. We've both tried to change our lives. You've
done it. Now I have the same chance. We're almost there. We should have
your transporter take us to corridor fourteen L, near the outer docking
ports. It's hardly ever used. Our contact will meet us there. <br>
NEELIX: We're within transporter range. I've entered the coordinates. <br>
(Wixiban takes a hand phaser from a locker.) <br>
NEELIX: What are you doing? <br>
WIXIBAN: This station is a dangerous place, and these supplies are
valuable. We have to be able to defend ourselves. <br>
NEELIX: You said this would be easy. <br>
WIXIBAN: It's just a precaution. Let's go. <br>

NEELIX: What kind of medical supplies are those? <br>
WIXIBAN: If you give me my payment, we'll be on our way. <br>

You lied to me from the beginning and I was foolish enough to believe
you! <br>
WIXIBAN: It should have been as easy as I said. I didn't know Sutok
would try to steal the tubes. <br>
NEELIX: Those aren't ordinary medical supplies. You failed to mention
that. <br>
WIXIBAN: They do have a medicinal application, but no one would pay
what I was supposed to get if they were just simple medications. <br>
NEELIX: They're narcotics, aren't they. Oh, you're up to your same old
tricks. We have to talk to Captain Janeway as soon as we get back. <br>
WIXIBAN: Do you really want to do that? How is it going to look to your
shipmates when they find out you were once a contraband smuggler, and
that you were involved in this ugly business tonight? You think your
position on Voyager is precarious now? Wait till they discover the
whole truth about you. <br>
NEELIX: I can't just forget about this. <br>
WIXIBAN: So you'd let Bahrat put me in cryostatic suspension? I guess
you would. You did let me spend a year in that Ubean prison. <br>
NEELIX: Wix. <br>
WIXIBAN: I never told you what it was like in there, did I? About
eating worms to stay alive. Sleeping in a cell where the vermin chew on
you all night. Being punished in ways you couldn't imagine. <br>

anything more to do with you. The debt is paid. </font></p>

JANEWAY: There's been a murder aboard the station. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Murder? <br>
JANEWAY: I've been told that's not an uncommon occurrence here. The man
who dies has been suspected of criminal activity. Mister Bahrat,
however, discovered something at the scene of the killing that greatly
concerns me. <br>
BAHRAT: During my investigation I discovered some energy readings I
couldn't identify, so I ran a spectral analysis. <br>
JANEWAY: He showed me the analysis just a few minutes ago. It's a
Federation phaser signature. Tuvok will be assisting Mister Bahrat in
his investigation. I want to know how a weapon from Voyager could have
been involved in this incident. <br>
BAHRAT: The shooting took place in an abandoned section of the station.
Security scanners were disabled. I'm reviewing other surveillance
records, looking for anything that might help me apprehend whoever did
this. <br>
JANEWAY: I've promised Mister Bahrat the full cooperation of every

You wanted to see me, Mister Tuvok? <br>

confirmed the Federation weapon signature. A type two phaser blast.
Fourteen Voyager crewmembers were off the ship at the time of the
incident. <br>
NEELIX: I see. <br>
TUVOK: Several traders from the station were aboard Voyager on the day
of the incident. We can't rule out the possibility that one of them
managed to steal a phaser. <br>
NEELIX: I suppose not. <br>
TUVOK: What can you tell me about your friend Wixiban? <br>
NEELIX: Wix? <br>
TUVOK: Mister Chakotay reported that he was aboard Voyager. <br>
NEELIX: Ah, yes. He delivered some magnetic bearings. We're more like
acquaintances, not friends really. I haven't seen him in years. <br>
TUVOK: Has he ever been involved in criminal activity? <br>

TUVOK: Were you ever alone on the ship? <br>
WIXIBAN: No. I was met by Mister Chakotay in your transporter room.
Extraordinary experience, that transporter of yours. We delivered
bearings to Lieutenant Torres, then Mister Chakotay and I paid a visit
to my old friend Neelix in your mess hall. <br>

WIXIBAN: The people I was conducting that transaction for aren't happy
that they didn't get paid. <br>
NEELIX: I thought this was your scheme? <br>
WIXIBAN: Do you think I could have afforded those tubes? I was acting
as an agent for some Kolaati traders. Do you know anything about the
Kolaati? They're mean as fire snakes. They will kill us, and it won't
be quick. <br>
NEELIX: I can't believe this is happening. Why did I ever listen to
you! <br>
WIXIBAN: Neelix, it's all right. I've convinced them to take something
else in payment. Something easily come by. They know about Voyager.
They want a sample of your ship's warp plasma. They'll be able to use
it to increase the efficiency of their engines. <br>
NEELIX: No. It's wrong. I won't do it. This has to stop. <br>
WIXIBAN: You should have thought of that in the beginning. You're in
too deeply now.<br>
NEELIX: The people on Voyager are my friends. I can't steal from them. <br>
WIXIBAN: Friends? You've already told me they're ready to put you off
the ship. You're living in a dream world. It's time to wake up. You're
on your own, just as I am, and you're going to die a horrible death at
the hands of the Kolaati unless you bring them three grammes of warp
plasma. Do you understand that? I've already told them you'll do it.

PARIS: I've thought a lot about that, and it comes down to one simple
fact. I didn't tell the truth. I made a mistake, which happens to
people, but if I'd admitted that mistake it would have been a lot
better. But I lied about it, and it nearly ruined my life. Why do you
ask? <br>
NEELIX: Oh, no reason. Just wondered. Here's your container. <br>
PARIS: After I've done here, a bunch of us are going to go down to the
resort. Why don't you come along? <br>
NEELIX: Thanks, but I'm going to turn in early. Maybe another time. <br>
PARIS: Okay. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> NEELIX:
Good evening, Ensign. <br>
VORIK: Mister Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: I thought I'd log a little time in the Jefferies tubes, if
that's all right. <br>
VORIK: I was unaware you were officially on an engineering work detail.
<br>
NEELIX: Oh, it's not official, not at all, but Lieutenant Torres has
been good enough to allow me to poke around here and there. As time
permits, of course. <br>
VORIK: She has mentioned your desire to become familiar with Starfleet
engineering protocols. I see no reason why you can't proceed. <br>
NEELIX: Thank you. Ensign Vorik. <br>
VORIK: Yes, Mister Neelix? <br>
NEELIX: You're quite young. Is it difficult for you being so far away
from everything that's familiar? <br>
VORIK: Had I been given the choice, I might not have chosen to explore
the Delta Quadrant. However, since we are here, I must say the
challenges are intriguing. <br>
NEELIX: Voyager is a wonderful place to be. People here are very
fortunate. <br>
VORIK: I would concur. <br>
(Neelix goes into the Jefferies tubes and climbs a ladder. At the
appropriate place, he opens a wall panel and takes a warp plasma
container from a bag. Then he closes his eyes.) </font></p>

WIXIBAN: Did you get it? Where is it? <br>
NEELIX: I have to talk to you. <br>
WIXIBAN: Give it to me. <br>
NEELIX: I didn't get the warp plasma. <br>
WIXIBAN: What? <br>
NEELIX: I couldn't do it. I just couldn't. We have to tell the truth.
It's the only way to make things right. <br>
WIXIBAN: We're dead men, Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: No. I have a plan. <br>
BAHRAT: You two! Stay where you are! <br>
WIXIBAN: Don't panic, stay calm. <br>
BAHRAT: I said, stay where you are! <br>
(Bahrat and his henchmen walk past Neelix and Wixiban, and go to
Chakotay and Paris.) <br>
PARIS: What is this? <br>
BAHRAT: You two are under arrest. <br>
PARIS: Arrest? <br>
CHAKOTAY: What's the charge? <br>
BAHRAT: Conspiring with known drug traffickers. And murder. Let's go! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Bahrat
shows Janeway and Tuvok surveillance footage of Chakotay and Paris
talking with Sutok.) <br>
BAHRAT: This is the criminal who was killed, and these are the two men
we arrested. <br>
JANEWAY: You can't seriously regard this as viable evidence. <br>
BAHRAT: I realise it's circumstantial, but it is compelling. <br>
JANEWAY: It proves absolutely nothing. <br>
BAHRAT: It proves your two men had a conversation with a narcotics
dealer only hours before he was killed. <br>
TUVOK: As the Captain said, that proves nothing. <br>
BAHRAT: I'm holding them for questioning. They are prime suspects. <br>
JANEWAY: I want my security officer present during all interrogations. <br>
BAHRAT: I'll take that into consideration. But make no mistake about
this. Someone will serve fifty years of cryostatic suspension for that
murder. If I were to let this go unpunished, it would be anarchy on
this station within days. <br>
JANEWAY: You make no mistake about this. I won't allow members of my
crew to be condemned for a crime they did not commit. </font></p>

(Janeway and Tuvok march past.) <br>
NEELIX: This has gone too far. We have to go to Bahrat. <br>
WIXIBAN: We'll end up in his cryostatic prison for decades. <br>
NEELIX: Not if he agrees to my plan. <br>
WIXIBAN: Your plan is crazy. It's worse than prison, it's a death
sentence. <br>
NEELIX: That would be better than living a lie. I'm going whether you
do or not. <br>
WIXIBAN: Neelix! We've been through too much together. I can't let you
do this alone. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bahrat's

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> NEELIX:
It was a type two Federation phaser that was used. It's on one of our
shuttles. You can get it from our security officer to verify the energy
signature. <br>
BAHRAT: Which of you fired the weapon? <br>
NEELIX: We were both involved in all aspects of the crime. <br>
WIXIBAN: I was the one with the weapon, but I fired in self-defence. <br>
NEELIX: So you see, Commander Chakotay and Lieutenant Paris are
innocent. <br>
BAHRAT: The punishment for trafficking in illicit substances is fifty
years of cryostatic imprisonment. <br>
NEELIX: Your cryostatic prison isn't a particularly effective
deterrent, is it? <br>
BAHRAT: It certainly is. There's very little narcotics trafficking that
goes on here. <br>
WIXIBAN: That's what you think. The Kolaati have made a fortune trading
drugs here. <br>
BAHRAT: I know everything that happens on this station. <br>
NEELIX: Apparently not, since we were able to deliver narcotics to
known criminals right under your nose. <br>
WIXIBAN: They have ways of disabling your surveillance systems, masking
your sensors, creating false visual signals. It happens almost every
night. <br>
BAHRAT: I'll put a stop to that. <br>
NEELIX: Since you don't know how they do it, that might prove
difficult. But we have a plan. The Kolaati want a sample of warp plasma
from Voyager. <br>
WIXIBAN: I'll arrange a meeting with them to deliver the plasma. When
they arrive, we'll take them into custody. <br>
BAHRAT: How do you plan to do that? You won't be able to carry weapons,
and if they thought my men and I were near, they'd be gone in a second.
<br>
NEELIX: We have some ideas. If we are able to turn them over to you,
will you agree not to charge us with a crime? <br>
BAHRAT: It's no risk to me. You'll undoubtedly perish in this
ridiculous scheme. <br>
NEELIX: You'll have to provide us with a sample of warp plasma. I won't
take any from Voyager. <br>
BAHRAT: What I can give you won't be of the same quality. <br>
NEELIX: Doesn't matter. We'll make do. <br>
BAHRAT: All right, we'll try it. But I don't hold any hopes that you
will survive. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> NEELIX:
It's been over twenty minutes. Where are they? <br>
WIXIBAN: I confirmed the time and place. They should be here. Maybe
they've realised it's a trap? Maybe they're not going to show up? <br>
NEELIX: Let's hope they do, or we will end up in Bahrat's prison. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (One
moment Bahrat has them on surveillance, then next he is seeing an empty

BAHRAT: It looks like someone's begun transmitting a false visual
signal. My guess is they're about to come aboard. We'll give them five
minutes, and then move in. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Three

WIXIBAN: It's Tosin. <br>
NEELIX: Who? <br>
WIXIBAN: He's one of the most powerful Kolaati. <br>
(Neelix presses a button on the plasma container, and they go to meet
them.) <br>
NEELIX: Good evening, gentlemen. My name is Neelix and I <br>
TOSIN: The warp plasma, where is it? <br>
WIXIBAN: It's right in here, Tosin, but first you must guarantee us <br>
TOSIN: You'll live for today. No guarantees about tomorrow. Give me the
plasma. Slowly. <br>
(Neelix hands over the container, and Tosin scans it.) <br>
TOSIN: Twenty parts per million isonucleic residue? This is
contaminated. You promised me a pure sample. <br>
NEELIX: It doesn't matter, because you're under arrest. <br>
TOSIN: What? <br>
NEELIX: I said, you're being taken into custody for smuggling
contraband and narcotic substances. Very serious offences aboard this
station, Mister Tosin. It's time you faced up to that. <br>
TOSIN: (laughs) Little man, your days have ended. <br>
NEELIX: I wouldn't fire that weapon if I were you. That plasma canister
you're holding. I disengaged the safety nodes just as you came in. Even
as we speak, warp plasma is leaking from it. This section of the
station is filling with plasma particles. Fire your weapon and you'll
set off an explosion that would undoubtedly kill us all. <br>
WIXIBAN: He's telling the truth, Tosin. Don't do it. <br>
NEELIX: And I wouldn't activate your transporter system, if I were you.
The beam would also destabilize the plasma. Same effect. Boom. <br>
TOSIN: Then you will die with me, little man. <br>
NEELIX: No problem at all, if it means getting rid of an Orillian lung
maggot like you. Go ahead. You'd be doing me a favour. I have nothing
to lose. Fire away! <br>
WIXIBAN: Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: Shoot. What are you waiting for? Fire! <br>
TOSIN: Re-engage the safety nodes. <br>
BAHRAT: Don't bother. Put down your weapons. You're under arrest for
violating station code four two seven nine, subsection beta three two
five. <br>
(One of Tosin's henchmen draws and fires his weapon at Bahrat.) <br>
TOSIN: No! Don't! <br>
(Everyone dives for cover as he ignites the green plasma particles and
incinerates himself.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> NEELIX:
I'm in sickbay? <br>
EMH: Yes, Mister Neelix. You sustained third degree plasma burns and a
moderate concussion, but my skills have prevented you from suffering
permanent damage. <br>
NEELIX: Thank you, Doctor. <br>
TUVOK: One of the criminals was killed in the plasma explosion. The
others have been taken into custody by Mister Bahrat. <br>
KES: Chakotay and Tom were released. <br>
NEELIX: Oh, good. And Wix? <br>
TUVOK: Mister Wixiban was given his shuttle. He sent you his thanks
before making a hasty departure. <br>
(Janeway enters.) <br>
JANEWAY: Would all of you excuse us, please? I'd like to talk to Neelix
alone. <br>
(Tuvok and Kes leave. The EMH goes to his office after receiving a
Look.) <br>
JANEWAY: Well, do you have anything to say for yourself? <br>
NEELIX: Only that I'm terribly sorry. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh. You're sorry. Is that supposed to make everything better?
I don't really care whether you're sorry or not, Neelix. At this point
it doesn't matter. I can't imagine what made you behave the way you
did, lying to us, sneaking around behind our backs, covering up
criminal activity. Did you have some misguided reason to think this was
acceptable behaviour? <br>
NEELIX: No, ma'am. <br>
JANEWAY: You've been one of my most trusted advisors since we began
this journey. How can I ever trust you again? How can I ever listen to
you without wondering whether you're telling the truth or not? <br>
NEELIX: I've never been dishonest to you before, I swear, Captain. I
just took one step. A step that seemed perfectly reasonable. And that
step lead to another and another, and before I knew what I was involved
in something I didn't know how to handle. <br>
JANEWAY: What was it? What was so important that you were willing to
throw away your principles? <br>
NEELIX: I needed a map. <br>
JANEWAY: A map? <br>
NEELIX: Captain, my usefulness to you was at an end. I don't know
anything about space beyond this point. I couldn't let you go into the
Nekrit Expanse without knowing what you faced. <br>
JANEWAY: You've been on this ship for two years. I'd think by now you'd
have learned that the first duty of any Starfleet officer is the truth.
You violated that duty, Neelix, and there will be consequences. <br>
NEELIX: I'm prepared to leave the ship, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh no, it's not that easy. You can't just walk away from your
responsibilities just because you made a mistake. You're part of a
family now. and you have obligations. <br>
NEELIX: But, I can't guide you. I can't advise you. I don't know what's
coming. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, that's not the point, is it? None of us knows what's
coming. That's what Starfleet is all about. We are all in this
together, Neelix, and we have to be able to count on each other no
matter how hard it gets. Do you understand? <br>
NEELIX: Yes. Yes, I do. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, that's good. Report to deuterium maintenance at oh four
hundred tomorrow morning. You're going to spend the next two weeks
scrubbing the exhaust manifolds. That should give you time to think
about what I've said. Dismissed. </font> </p>
