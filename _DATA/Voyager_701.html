<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(An alien woman stands with the former Borg children.)<br>WYSANTI:
Thank you again for taking care of them, Captain. We're very grateful. <br>
JANEWAY: We're just glad that Rebi and Azan will have a chance to grow
up with their own people, and that you've been kind enough to let Mezoti
join them. <br>
MEZOTI: You can still come with us. <br>
ICHEB: And you can still stay on Voyager. <br>
MEZOTI: Adapting to your absence will be difficult. <br>
ICHEB: I'll miss you, too. <br>
SEVEN: It's time. <br>
MEZOTI: I've been studying all available data relevant to this species,
as you recommended. <br>
SEVEN: Familiarising yourself with their culture will help you adapt. <br>
MEZOTI: On Wysanti, it is not customary to say goodbye but, I think I
prefer the human way. <br>(Mezoti hugs Seven, then the twins do the same.) <br>
JANEWAY: Energise. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
We should deactivate the children's alcoves. <br>
ICHEB: Right now? <br>
SEVEN: They're a drain on Voyager's power reserves. Is there a problem?
<br>
ICHEB: It just seems like an insufficient amount of time has passed. <br>
SEVEN: You're having an emotional response to the children's departure.
They'll be fine. We should be happy for them. <br>
ICHEB: Seven? <br>(He sees a tear rolling down her chin.)<br>SEVEN: Yes? <br>
ICHEB: You're crying. <br>
SEVEN: My ocular implant must be malfunctioning. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH:
Crying is nothing to be ashamed of, Seven. You should have seen me the
first time I heard Puccini's Tosca in the holodeck. I sobbed through
the entire third act. <br>
SEVEN: You're a hologram. You can't cry. <br>
EMH: Ordinarily. But Lieutenant Torres enhanced my emotional
subroutines so I could truly appreciate the performance. <br>
SEVEN: Then your reaction was the result of a technological enhancement,
just as mine was the result of a technological malfunction. <br>
EMH: Saying goodbye to the children was a traumatic experience. Crying
was a normal response. <br>
SEVEN: Except that I was in complete control of my emotions. <br>
EMH: Hmm. It seems I owe you an apology. According to this, your tears were
the result of a glitch in your primary cortical node. Have you
experienced any other malfunctions lately? Headache? Dizziness?
Diminished motor function? <br>
SEVEN: No. <br>
EMH: Really? Then you won't mind if I check the bio-monitors in your
alcove, just to be sure? <br>
SEVEN: I've experienced an occasional headache. <br>
EMH: Why didn't you come to see me? <br>
SEVEN: The malfunctions have not affected my work. <br>
EMH: Seven, if you're having problems, you need to let me know. <br>
SEVEN: If it'll make you feel better, I'll be more forthcoming in the
future. <br>
EMH: You're all heart. I'll schedule some follow-up tests and make my
report to the Captain. <br>
SEVEN: I'd prefer to keep this between us. I don't want to worry the
Captain. <br>
EMH: We've always kept her informed of your medical needs. <br>
SEVEN: It was my understanding that all members of this crew have the
right to doctor-patient confidentiality. <br>
EMH: If you want to keep this between us, that's where it'll stay. </font></p>

Have you finished charting the nebula in sector nine four nine? <br>
ICHEB: Several hours ago. I've been thinking. While I'm grateful for
the opportunity to assist you in Astrometrics, I'd like to take on more
challenging assignments. <br>
SEVEN: I can assign you additional diagnostics. <br>
ICHEB: That's not what I meant. I want to work on the bridge. <br>
SEVEN: You don't have the proper training. <br>
ICHEB: That's why I'd like to take the entrance exam for Starfleet
Academy. I could forward it to Earth in the next datastream
transmission. If I pass, I could take the basic classes from Commander
Tuvok. He was an instructor at the Academy. <br>
SEVEN: Your plan is ambitious. <br>
ICHEB: Then you think it's a good idea? You could take the classes with
me. Earn your own commission. <br>
SEVEN: I believe I've already assimilated enough Starfleet training. <br>
ICHEB: I'll need a letter of recommendation from the captain. <br>
SEVEN: I'll speak to her. <br>(Something moves under the skin of Seven's right hand. She covers it with her left.)<br>SEVEN: I have work to complete in the Cargo bay. Can

NEELIX: What's all this? <br>
SEVEN: Nutritional supplements. I thought they would compensate. <br>
NEELIX: Your own recipe? <br>
SEVEN: It's a mixture of metabolic enzymes and protein extract. <br>
NEELIX: Let me make you one of my Talaxian omelettes. It may not have
as many enzymes, but it'll taste better. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
You lost consciousness in the mess hall. Your body's begun to reject
your implants. <br>
EMH: I'm afraid it's a result of that glitch we found in your cortical
node. Apparently, it's more serious than we thought. <br>(Cortical scan 138 does not bring good news.)<br>
SEVEN: The node is destabilising. <br>
EMH: It's no longer able to regulate your implants. They're shutting
down one by one. <br>
SEVEN: When you've disconnected implants in the past, I've always
adapted. <br>
EMH: Minor implants. An assimilation tubule here, a few nanoprobes
there. Nothing crucial to your human physiology. But these implants
control your vital functions. <br>
SEVEN: And without my cortical node to regulate them, I'll die.
Correct? <br>(Janeway is suddenly fascinated by her own fingernails.)<br>SEVEN: Borg technology is highly adaptive. My cortical node will
repair itself in time. <br>
EMH: I don't think so, Seven. If anything, the deterioration is
accelerating. <br>
JANEWAY: You'll have to stay here for observation. <br>
SEVEN: I think I've been sufficiently observed. <br>
JANEWAY: Would you excuse us, please? <br>(The EMH leaves them.) <br>JANEWAY: I'm sorry for
what's happening. You have every right to be angry, but that isn't going
to help us solve this problem. <br>
SEVEN: The node will correct itself. <br>
JANEWAY: Suppose it doesn't, for the sake of argument. Is it possible
to replicate a new one? <br>
SEVEN: The technology is too complex. <br>
JANEWAY: What if this had happened when you were part of the
Collective? How would the Borg have repaired the damage? <br>
SEVEN: They wouldn't have. Trying to repair a node would be a futile
exercise. The Borg would simply replace it. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Harry, we passed a Borg debris field six or seven days ago just outside
the Yontasa Expanse. See if you can find it on long range sensors. <br>
KIM: Yes, ma'am. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's not every day we go looking for the Borg. What's up? <br>
JANEWAY: Seven needs a new cortical node. <br>
TUVOK: Captain, need I remind you the Borg often return to salvage
damaged cubes. <br>
JANEWAY: It's a risk I'm willing to take. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I want to help Seven as much as anyone, but if we're not
careful we'll all end up with cortical nodes. <br>
PARIS: That's why I'm taking the Flyer, alone. <br>
KIM: I've located the debris field. <br>
JANEWAY: Transmit the coordinates to the Flyer. You have the bridge,
Commander. <br>
PARIS: With all due respect. The last time you took the Delta Flyer to
confront the Borg, it ended up in a couple of thousand pieces. <br>
JANEWAY: I intend to bring it back in one piece this time. <br>
PARIS: A good pilot might be able to help you do that. <br>
TUVOK: Particularly if he's accompanied by an experienced Tactical
Officer. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You shouldn't do this by yourself, Captain. <br>

ICHEB: And you don't approve? <br>
JANEWAY: Of what? <br>
ICHEB: My request. <br>
JANEWAY: Request? <br>
ICHEB: I'm sure Seven will discuss it with you when she has the chance.
I'm sorry I bothered you. <br>
JANEWAY: Obviously, no one's told you. <br>
ICHEB: Told me what? <br>
JANEWAY: Seven isn't well. <br>
ICHEB: What's wrong with her? <br>
JANEWAY: Her cortical node is failing. <br>
ICHEB: Her cortical node? She's going to die. <br>
JANEWAY: Not if we find a new node. We're on our way to search a Borg
debris field. <br>
ICHEB: I have experience in Borg technology. Let me come with you. <br>
JANEWAY: I appreciate the offer, but it's too dangerous. <br>

ICHEB: I don't understand. <br>
EMH: It's a common response to serious illness. She's frustrated to be
confined. Embarrassed to appear vulnerable. <br>
ICHEB: She shouldn't be embarrassed in front of me. I'm her friend. <br>
EMH: And her pupil. She doesn't want you or anyone else to see her when
she's not at her best. <br>
ICHEB: It's not her fault that she's sick. <br>

consciousness. As long as the hive exists, so will a part of that

EMH: You can stay, provided you wear this cortical monitor. <br>(He throws it up to Seven, who catches it. The EMH leaves.)<br>
SEVEN: Thank you.<br>(Seven puts on the monitor and returns to her work.) </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">ICHEB:
Are you feeling better? <br>
SEVEN: My condition is unchanged. I've spoken to the Captain about your
desire to apply to Starfleet Academy. She's agreed to administer the
entrance exam before we send the next datastream to Earth. <br>(She hands him a
PADD.)
<br>SEVEN: It's a list of crewmen who can help you study. Lieutenant Torres is
extremely well-versed in warp mechanics. Ensign Kim claims to have aced
the quantum theory section. <br>
ICHEB: What about Astrometrics? <br>
SEVEN: You know more about Astrometrics than most Starfleet officers. <br>
ICHEB: Still, I'll need someone to review the material with me. <br>
SEVEN: I'll ask Lieutenant Paris to set aside some time. <br>
ICHEB: I'd rather study with you. <br>
SEVEN: You've become too dependent on me. You must learn to rely on
others. <br>
ICHEB: And if I don't want to? <br>
SEVEN: What you want is irrelevant. <br>
ICHEB: Why are you acting like this? Is it because you think you're
dying? <br>
SEVEN: I am dying. I'm sorry. <br>
ICHEB: You may have given up, but I haven't. <br>(Icheb spends some time alone in Astrometrics looking at medical scans.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Doctor's office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">ICHEB: I
know how to save her. <br>
EMH: I'm certainly open to suggestions. <br>
ICHEB: I've been analysing the simulations you performed. They failed
because you tried to implement a cortical node from a dead drone. <br>
EMH: That's correct. <br>
ICHEB: What you require is a live drone. <br>
EMH: I've already been through that with Captain Janeway. <br>
ICHEB: My cortical node is operational. I want you to remove it and
give it to Seven. <br>
EMH: Absolutely not! <br>
ICHEB: Well, at least review my research.&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b><br></font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: It may as well be a suicide note. <br>
ICHEB: I don't agree. <br>
EMH: Well, that's comforting. <br>
ICHEB: You took these scans of me when I left the Collective. By your
own estimation I emerged from my maturation chamber before I was fully
assimilated. As a result my physiology is less dependent on my
implants. <br>
EMH: They still regulate many of your vital functions. <br>
ICHEB: What about my age? I'm younger, so it should be easier for my
body to adapt to the loss. <br>
EMH: You're obviously too young to understand the risks involved. <br>
ICHEB: I understand the risks perfectly. If we continue to do nothing,
Seven will die. <br>
EMH: And if we proceed with your idea, you could both die. <br>
ICHEB: According to my research, there's an eighty six point nine
percent chance that Seven's implants will adapt to my node. <br>
EMH: Eighty-six <br>
ICHEB: Point nine. <br>
EMH: What about you? Without a cortical node, how will you regulate your
implants? <br>
ICHEB: You should be able to compensate with genetic resequencing. This
isn't suicide, Doctor. I believe it can work. All I ask is that you
consider it. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Seven is looking at an image of the Grand Canyon on the screen.)<br>JANEWAY:
Earth's biggest ditch. That's what my father used to call it. We hiked
the north rim when I was nine. <br>
SEVEN: It's an impressive geological formation. <br>
JANEWAY: Too dusty. I've always preferred farm country myself. <br>(Seven changes the image.)<br>
SEVEN: Bloomington, Indiana. Your home town. You've mentioned it on
several occasions. <br>
JANEWAY: So, what do you think? <br>
SEVEN: It appears to be a pleasant environment. <br>
JANEWAY: When we get to Earth I'll take you there. <br>
SEVEN: It's more likely this crew will reach Earth without me. <br>
JANEWAY: You don't know that. <br>
SEVEN: You refuse to acknowledge the severity of my condition, just as
I did at first. <br>
JANEWAY: Are you giving up? <br>
SEVEN: I'm merely accepting reality. <br>
JANEWAY: If I'd accepted reality six years ago, I'd have settled on the
first M class planet we came across. Instead, I'm thirty thousand light
years closer to Bloomington, Indiana. <br>
SEVEN: Minus several members of your crew. <br>(Seven displays the list of deceased crewmembers.)<br>SEVEN: Ensign Marie Kaplan, Ensign
Lindsay Ballard, Crewman Timothy Lang. <br>
JANEWAY: Is there a point to this? <br>
SEVEN: Every person on this list died under your command. You accepted
their deaths. But I don't believe you'll accept mine. <br>
JANEWAY: That's presumptuous. <br>
SEVEN: I'm not being egotistical. On the contrary, I'm trying to make a
point. <br>
JANEWAY: Which is? <br>
SEVEN: All of these crew members came to Voyager with unique
personalities, but I've required your constant assistance to develop my
individuality. <br>
JANEWAY: And you've come a long way. <br>
SEVEN: But not far enough. I've disappointed you. You feel your task is
incomplete. That's why my death will be difficult for you to accept. <br>
JANEWAY: Is that what you think? That you haven't lived up to my
expectations? <br>
SEVEN: Clearly, I haven't. But I want you to know that the failure has
been mine, not yours. <br>
JANEWAY: You haven't failed, Seven. You've exceeded my expectations.
You've become an individual. An extraordinary individual. If I'm having
trouble accepting your condition, it's only because I don't want to lose
a friend. <br>
EMH [OC]: Doctor to the captain. I need to see you and Seven right
away. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
It would be a complicated procedure. <br>
EMH: No doubt. <br>
JANEWAY: But you believe it'll work. <br>
EMH: There are significant risks involved to Seven and Icheb, but if
you're asking me if it's possible I'd have to say yes. <br>
JANEWAY: What sort of precautions <br>
SEVEN: No matter how many precautions you take, it's not worth the risk
to Icheb. <br>
ICHEB: Seven, this could work. <br>
SEVEN: I'm not willing to extend my life at the cost of yours. <br>
ICHEB: You haven't reviewed all the data. <br>
SEVEN: As long as there is any chance you won't survive, the data is
irrelevant. I'd like to return to Sickbay now. <br>
EMH: As you wish. &nbsp;<br>(Seven and the EMH leave.)<br>
ICHEB: You're the captain. You could order her to do it. <br>
JANEWAY: I have to respect her wishes. <br>
ICHEB: Even if it kills her? <br>
JANEWAY: I want to help her just as much as you do. <br>
ICHEB: If that were true, you wouldn't let her die. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: Is
there anything I can bring from the Cargo Bay to make you feel more at
home? <br>
SEVEN: No, thank you. <br>
EMH: Something from the mess hall? A piece of fruit? <br>
SEVEN: Are you offering me my last meal? <br>
EMH: I. Of course not. Is that what you thought? <br>
SEVEN: I was attempting to lighten the mood. <br>
EMH: Ah, yes. Well done. <br>
ICHEB [OC]: Icheb to the Doctor. Report to Cargo Bay two immediately. <br>
SEVEN: He's persistent. <br>
EMH: Not to worry. I'll make it clear to him that persistence is
futile. </font></p>

Icheb? <br>(Icheb is in his alcove, twitching.)<br>
EMH: He's disengaged his cortical node. <br>
JANEWAY: How? <br>
ICHEB: My alcove. I programmed it to disconnect my neural relays. <br>
JANEWAY: Can you reconnect them? <br>
EMH: He's locked me out of the controls. <br>
JANEWAY: How could you do this? <br>
ICHEB: It was the only way I could prove to you that it would work. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Janeway

SEVEN: What's wrong with him? <br>
JANEWAY: Icheb decided to perform a little operation on himself. <br>
SEVEN: You have to reconnect his node immediately. <br>
EMH: I intend to. <br>
ICHEB: No. If Seven can refuse treatment, so can I. <br>
EMH: We don't have time for this. <br>
ICHEB: Check your scans. You'll see I'm already adapting. <br>
EMH: Some of your implants have adapted, but not all. <br>
ICHEB: Then apply the resequencing technique I researched. <br>
SEVEN: This debate is pointless. I won't accept the node. <br>
ICHEB: And I won't keep it. <br>
EMH: Someone had better use the damn thing. If it stays disconnected
much longer it won't do either of you any good. <br>
SEVEN: You're acting like a child. <br>
ICHEB: I'm trying to save your life. <br>
SEVEN: Only because you've grown too dependent on me. <br>
ICHEB: You think I need to learn to rely on other people? <br>
SEVEN: Yes. <br>
ICHEB: What about you? You've refused to rely on a single member of
this crew. You hid your condition from the rest of us, you deactivated
the Doctor, and now you're rejecting my help. You're the one who needs
to rely on others. Isn't that what people on this ship do? They help
each other? <br>
JANEWAY: Whenever we can. <br>
ICHEB: If the Captain were dying, you'd risk your life to save her,
wouldn't you? And when you respond to a distress call, you're risking
the life of everyone on this ship to respond to the aid of strangers. <br>
JANEWAY: He's right. <br>
SEVEN: Captain, he's just a child. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't think he is. Not anymore. <br>
SEVEN: Doctor! <br>
EMH: Don't look at me. <br>
ICHEB: Please, just let us help you. <br>(So a short time later, the EMH is performing a living donor transplant, with Paris and Janeway assisting.)<br>EMH:

removes Icheb's cortical node and Paris closes that wound. Then he
removes Seven's stuttering node and replaces it with Icheb's
functioning one.)

it's temporary. <br>
SEVEN: Pain I caused him. <br>
EMH: Pain he was willing to endure. <br>(The EMH wakes Icheb.) <br>
ICHEB: You've recovered. <br>
SEVEN: I expect the same from you. <br>
ICHEB: The Doctor wants to keep me here another week, but I'm sure I'll
be back on my feet in half that time. <br>
SEVEN: I suggest you get as much rest as you can. You're going to need
it. <br>
ICHEB: Why? <br>
