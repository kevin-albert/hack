<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Paris is working underneath a car in a
large garage whilst 60s rock music plays. Night Rider by Dick Dale, I'm
told. The EMH appears and sounds the car's horn several times.)<br>PARIS:
Ow! Ow! What do you think you're doing, Doc? <br>
EMH: An impromptu auditory exam.<br>
PARIS: Did I pass? <br>
EMH: With flying colours, which leads me to believe you did hear me
when I requested you meet me this morning. <br>(Paris turns off the transistor radio.)<br>
PARIS: You're right. I forgot. <br>
EMH: I see. I realise your Sickbay training is purely voluntary, but
you haven't spent any time there in several weeks. And when I try to
find you, you're always in the holodeck.<br>
PARIS: Correct me if I'm wrong, Doc, but we haven't been treating
anything more serious than an ingrown toenail. <br>
EMH: That's beside the point. If an emergency were to happen you must
be prepared. You're too far behind in your medical texts to be wasting your
time in the holodeck. <br>
PARIS: If it's any consolation, I have spent most of the morning
immersed in a complicated surgical procedure. <br>
EMH: Really. <br>
PARIS: A classic case of atrophied shocks. They needed to be extracted
to prevent chrome abrasion. It was touch and go for a while, but the
prognosis is excellent. <br>
EMH: You'll be ready for neurosurgery in no time. <br>
PARIS: Take a look at this, Doc. This is a fully stock 1969 Chevy
Camaro, one of the earliest muscle cars ever made. <br>(Paris gets into the driver's seat.)<br>PARIS: Imagine, Northern
California, late twentieth century. You're cruising up Highway One, the
woofers are pounding, the wind is whipping through your hair. <br>
EMH: Medieval safety constraints, internal combustion system producing
lethal levels of carbon monoxide. Hmm. I stand corrected. This may be just
what you need to get you back to Sickbay. <br>
PARIS: I guess I should have known this wouldn't interest you. It's too
much fun. <br>
EMH: This isn't about fun, Mister Paris. Serving in Sickbay is a
privilege. I'd expect you to realise that. <br>
PARIS: Oh, I do. I'll be there. Soon. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Lieutenant Paris, report to the bridge immediately. <br>
PARIS: I'm on my way. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Paris enters, still in his dirty overalls.)<br>PARIS:
Somebody call for a driver? <br>
JANEWAY: Take your station, Tom. Anything on scans, Harry? <br>
KIM: I'm picking up another spatial disturbance two thousand kilometres
away.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Source? <br>
KIM: I have no idea. It looks like space is folding in on itself. <br>
JANEWAY: Shields to full. <br>(A small spaceship appears.)<br>
KIM: It's an alien vessel, one occupant aboard. <br>
PARIS: Captain, it looks like that ship is being powered by a coaxial
warp drive. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Coaxial what? <br>
PARIS: It's a hypothetical propulsion system. Starfleet engineers have
been dreaming about it for years. In theory, it can literally fold the
fabric of space allowing a ship to travel instantaneously across huge
distances. <br>(Whumph! Energy plays over the alien ship.)<br>
TUVOK: The alien warp drive is overloading. <br>
PARIS: In theory, a coaxial drive explosion could collapse space within
a radius of a billion kilometres. In theory. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's keep theory from becoming reality. Red alert! <br>
CHAKOTAY: Scan the vessel. Can we beam the pilot out? <br>
KIM: Too much interference. <br>
PARIS: That ship's about had it, Captain. The coaxial core is breaching.
<br>
TUVOK: We should vacant this area of space at once. <br>
PARIS: We can't just leave him like this. <br>
JANEWAY: Try one more hail. <br>
KIM: Nothing. Maybe he's ignoring us. <br>
PARIS: Or maybe he's unconscious. We've got to do something. <br>
JANEWAY: Suggestions? <br>
PARIS: A symmetric warp field. That should contain any instabilities in
his space-folding core. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How can you be sure? <br>
PARIS: Advanced subspace geometry. It's the one course at the academy
where I actually paid attention. We'll tractor him in to kill his
momentum, generate a warp field around his ship. <br>
TUVOK: His flightpath is erratic. We'd be risking collision. <br>
PARIS: Captain, I can make this work. <br>
JANEWAY: Do it. <br>
PARIS: Passing through the residual folds in space. Steady. Got him! <br>
TUVOK: I've extended our warp field around his vessel. His core is
powering down. <br>
JANEWAY: Nice flying, Tom. <br>
PARIS: My pleasure. <br>
KIM: We're finally receiving a hail. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Open a channel. <br>
JANEWAY: Captain Janeway, of the Federation Starship Voyager. Do you
need medical attention? <br>(A humanoid with an elaborate nose to forehead structure, with a pair of nostrils at the top as well as bottom.)<br>
STETH [on viewscreen]: I'm fine, Captain. Unfortunately my ship is not.
<br>
JANEWAY: If you need to make repairs, we might be able to help. <br>
STETH [on viewscreen]: That's very generous. <br>
JANEWAY: We'll beam you aboard in a few minutes. Stand by. <br>
STETH [on viewscreen]: Thank you. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Energise. <br>(Steth is beamed aboard.)<br>JANEWAY: Welcome. <br>
STETH: Captain, I know you put yourselves in danger to rescue me. I
want to thank you. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm glad we could help. <br>
STETH: I was so eager to test my new engine, I pushed it beyond it's
limits. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Coaxial warp doesn't seem to be the smoothest way to travel. <br>
STETH: It's a violent procedure, but it allows a ship to travel through
space at incredible speeds. <br>
TUVOK: Considering the dangers, this method of travel hardly seems
logical. <br>
STETH: That's probably true, but if I were worrying about danger I
wouldn't have become a test pilot. <br>
JANEWAY: Where are you from? <br>
STETH: The fourth planet of the Benthan system. That's about twenty
light years from here. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll speak to my engineers about helping you with repairs.
Without your coaxial drive, it's a long way home. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Chakotay's office]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
CHAKOTAY: Come in. <br>
PARIS: I'd like to ask you a favour. I need a change of pace. I'd like
to help Steth repair his ship. <br>
CHAKOTAY: This isn't a good time to ask. <br>
PARIS: What do you mean? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I've been reading a report from the Doctor. You didn't show
up today. <br>
PARIS: I was a little busy this morning. Saving someone's life, as I
recall. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Is there something wrong, Tom? Anything bothering you? <br>
PARIS: Nothing is wrong. Since when is not wanting to spend time with
the Doctor a capital offence? You'd have to throw the whole crew in the
brig for that one. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe. I was wondering if there's something on your mind.
You're showing up for your duty shifts, you do what's required, but
your heart doesn't seem to be in it. You seem preoccupied. <br>
PARIS: Like I said, I think I need a change of pace. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You're a different man from the one that came on board four
years ago. You've taken charge of your life, turned yourself around.
I'd hate to see you ruin it. <br>
PARIS: I won't. With your permission, I'll report to Sickbay. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Permission denied. Report to Steth's ship instead. Assist in
the repairs. We need our best man on the job. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Steth's
ship]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> STETH:
And on my way back, I made the mistake of flying the prototype through
restricted Entaban territory. <br>
PARIS: And? <br>
STETH: And the Entabans weren't too pleased to see me. I limped back to
the engineers on Benthos with phaser holes through their brand new
extanium fuselage. I think they would have been happy to see phaser
holes through me. <br>
PARIS: When I was sixteen, I followed an ancient human custom. I took
my father's shuttle out for a joy ride, and proceeded to fry all the
relays. <br>(Benind his back, Steth turns into a woman, then back to a man again.)<br>
STETH: I'm guessing he wasn't happy about getting it back. <br>
PARIS: Actually he didn't. As far as I know, it's still at the bottom
of Lake Tahoe. <br>
STETH: Here it is, the coaxial induction drive. It draws in subatomic
particles and reconfigures their internal geometries. <br>
PARIS: And this is what makes folding space possible? <br>
STETH: At least in spurts. Unfortunately, particle instabilities keep
overloading my engines. But I'm going to make it work. I have to keep in
motion. I don't like the thought of settling down. Too many new ships
to drive. Too many intriguing women. <br>
PARIS: Yeah, I guess so. <br>
STETH: When I get this ship back I'm going to be doing the first test
on a new Mithran class flyer. I'm told it's more advanced than any
warship in the quadrant. Why don't you come with me? We'd have a great
time. You could meet up with Voyager afterwards. <br>
PARIS: I'd love to do that. It sounds very exciting. But I have
responsibilities here. People who count on me. B'Elanna would be
furious. B'Elanna. I have to go. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Mess

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PARIS:
So, you started without me. <br>
TORRES: I finished without you. You're a little late. <br>
PARIS: Sorry. I was helping Steth repair his ship. <br>
TORRES: How's it going? <br>
PARIS: Pretty slow. We're both stuck on how to prevent the particle
overloads in his propulsion system. <br>
TORRES: Have you tried an isokinetic containment field? <br>
PARIS: Yeah, that's the first thing we tried. <br>
TORRES: How long do you think repairs are going to take? <br>
PARIS: I don't know. <br>
TORRES: I was just hoping that maybe you could help me recalibrate the
plasma manifolds tonight. <br>
PARIS: Ah. I, er, I probably should go help Steth. <br>
TORRES: Tom, is there something wrong? <br>
PARIS: Why are you interrogating me? <br>
TORRES: I didn't think I was. <br>
PARIS: It sounds more like you want me to account for every minute that
I'm not with you. <br>
TORRES: That's ridiculous. <br>
PARIS: Can't I have some time to myself? Can't I do what I want without
having to report every detail of it to you? <br>
TORRES: Tom, you can do whatever you want. I just wanted to know if
there was something wrong. I mean, lately you've been cancelling dates. You hide out for hours in the holodeck. <br>
PARIS: I am not hiding anything. That is ridiculous. <br>
TORRES: Is it? You haven't even told me what holodeck programme this is
that has you so fascinated. <br>
PARIS: The Dancing Girls of Ninipia Prime. It's very entertaining, <br>
TORRES: Very funny. <br>
PARIS: You're overreacting. <br>
TORRES: I am not overreacting. There's obviously something going on
and you're refusing to admit it. <br>
NEELIX: Good evening, Lieutenants. I see you don't have your dinner
yet, Tom. Can I get you something? <br>
PARIS: I'm really not hungry. <br>
TORRES: Excuse me. Are you going to talk about this? Because if you're
not, I don't want to sit here anymore. <br>
PARIS: If you can carry on an adult conversation without all the
histrionics<br>
TORRES: Good night, Tom. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PARIS:
So I was lying in bed last night when it hit me. What you need is a
carburettor. <br>
STETH: A carburettor? <br>
PARIS: Yes. It's a device that's hundreds of years old. I can't believe
I didn't think of it yesterday. <br>
STETH: Wait. Hundreds of years old? Surely that couldn't be of any use
to us now. <br>
PARIS: It all goes back to basics. You would be surprised at how often
I find solutions to twenty fourth century problems in twentieth century
technology. Computer, access Paris programme alpha one, Grease Monkey. <br>
STETH: Grease Monkey? <br>
PARIS: Mechanic lingo. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Holodeck
- Grease Monkey programme]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Paris has taken the carburetter from his Camaro.)<br>PARIS:
A car's engine can't run on pure fuel, so the carburettor supplies it
with a mixture of vaporised fuel and air. <br>
STETH: And you think we need a device like that to dilute the particle
stream as it enters the coaxial drive. <br>
PARIS: Exactly! And a spare polaric modulator from Voyager's impulse
drive should do the trick. <br>
STETH: Subatomic dilution! It never would have occurred to me. I think
you've solved it. <br>
PARIS: Well, we can run a few simulations on the holodeck before we
actually try it. <br>
STETH: I owe you a lot. <br>
PARIS: You can thank my lucky toolbox. It's gotten me out of hot water
more than once. <br>
STETH: You're lucky to be stationed on a ship like this. Replicators to
feed and clothe you, holotechnology to cater to every whim. Hallways
filled with women. <br>
PARIS: Yeah. It's great. <br>
STETH: You don't sound convinced. Aren't you happy here? <br>
PARIS: Of course I'm happy. I'm very happy. I mean, I pilot one of the
most advanced ships in Starfleet, I have a beautiful girlfriend, I'm
respected. I have everything that I've ever wanted. <br>
STETH: You're lucky, You're part of a family, part of a structure. You
have rules to guide you. You don't have to worry about making a lot of
choices. I usually go to bed at night not knowing what the next day has
in store, what trouble I might get into. You don't have to worry about
those things. You're very settled. <br>
PARIS: I remember those days. I used to be a lot like you. Going
anywhere, doing whatever I wanted, making my own rules. <br>(Paris refits the carburetter. Steth becomes female behind his back, but the voice stays the same.)<br>
STETH: Well, then there's hope for me yet, Maybe someday I'll settle
down too. But for now I prefer to stay on the move. <br>
PARIS: Sometimes I wish that's what I was doing. &nbsp;<br>(Paris stands, and Steth is back to male.)<br>
STETH: Things'll turn around for you. I've always found that change is
inevitable. It comes when you least expect it. <br>
PARIS: Yeah, I suppose. <br>
STETH: Now, are we ready to try this carburettor idea on my ship? <br>
PARIS: Just give me five more minutes to finish up here and I'll be
right with you. <br>
STETH: Five minutes. And Tom? Don't dismiss the suggestion I made, about
coming with me to fly the new ship. It might be fun to escape the
shackles for a while.<br>PARIS: Hmm.<br>(He discovers that there is a tool missing from his lucky tool box.) </font></p>

You're early, Mister Paris. I see some good came from my report to

STETH/PARIS: What would you say to twenty four glorious hours on the
famed fourth planet of the Kendren system? <br>
TORRES: You mean the planet where Neelix is gathering food samples? <br>
STETH/PARIS: I ran a few scans and found the most incredible beach
on one of the smaller continents. I replicated a picnic lunch for us.
Voyager isn't leaving orbit until tomorrow. We'd have an entire day. <br>

SEVEN: We were supposed to meet in the shuttlebay at twenty one
hundred hours. Did you forget? <br>
STETH/PARIS: I did. I got so caught up with my reading I guess it
slipped my mind. Sorry. <br>
SEVEN: The capillaries in your eyes are swollen, Lieutenant, and I see
signs of vascular congestion in your cheeks. Are you intoxicated? <br>
STETH/PARIS: No, not at all. I was just exploring the replicator,
trying some alien beverages. Only a few were alcoholic. <br>
SEVEN: You are not officially off-duty for another seventy eight
minutes. <br>
STETH/PARIS: I'm on break. Would you like to join me? I could
replicate another Trakian ale for you. <br>
SEVEN: That will not be necessary. <br>
STETH/PARIS: Relax, Seven. You're not on the Borg Cube any more. We
could finish our work on the shuttle tomorrow. <br>
SEVEN: That would be an inefficient use of our time. I will complete
the work myself. <br>
STETH/PARIS: Fine. <br>
SEVEN: Before I leave, I would like to know why you were reading the captain's personal logs?<br>
STETH/PARIS: I wasn't. <br>
SEVEN: I saw the PADD. It was unmistakably the captain's logs. <br>
STETH/PARIS: You're wrong. You're confused. You couldn't possibly
have seen anything. <br>
SEVEN: You know I possess an eidetic memory. I require only seconds to
commit what I see to memory. Would you like me to quote the passage you
were reading? <br>
STETH/PARIS: I'm warning you, stay out of my way! Don't interfere in
things that don't concern you. If you bother me again, I will make

STETH/PARIS: You wanted to see me, Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: Yes. I received a rather disturbing report from Seven of Nine
regarding your conduct last night. She claims you were drinking on
duty. <br>
STETH/PARIS: She's mistaken, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Don't lie to me, Tom. I checked the computers. You replicated
five alcoholic beverages in the mess hall. She also said you threatened
her. <br>
STETH/PARIS: I'm sorry, Captain. B'Elanna and I had an argument. I
was upset. <br>
JANEWAY: And is that why you were reading my personal logs? <br>
STETH/PARIS: I wasn't! <br>
JANEWAY: Seven recited a passage which I'd written, word for word. <br>
STETH/PARIS: She probably accessed those files herself. Captain, you
can't take the word of a Borg over mine. <br>
JANEWAY: This has to stop, Tom. Your conduct lately has been bizarre,
and I've heard far too many complaints from far too many people to
dismiss it. Chakotay, the Doctor, Seven of Nine. They're all worried
about you. And so am I. <br>
STETH/PARIS: You're right, Captain. I need some rest. I'll go right
to my quarters. <br>
JANEWAY: Tom! As your Captain and as your friend, I want you to report
to Sickbay for some tests. We have to find out if there's something
physical that's causing this behaviour. <br>

possible. <br>
DAELEN: The alien seems capable of some sort of selective DNA exchange.
He absorbs new DNA while depositing his current genetic material into
his victims. Let's hope he can reverse that process. <br>

Neurological scans yielded very little, but I did find something very

EMH: I don't know, but I'm running more scans to see how this might
have affected his neurological functions. <br>
