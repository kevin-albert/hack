Dominion and the Breen. </font></p>

will share a cell. They may wish to physically comfort each other

rituals fascinating to watch. <br>

DAMAR: Interesting device. <br>
WEYOUN: I am so sorry. Where are my manners? Allow me to introduce
Legate Damar, head of the Cardassian Union. Thot Gor. <br>
DAMAR: Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? <br>
GOR: (electronic noise) <br>

DAMAR: What did he say? <br>
WEYOUN: He says you need to get your universal translator adjusted. <br>

you. <br>
GOR: (electronic noise) <br>
FOUNDER: Thank you. If our face to face talks are as productive as our
subspace communications have been, I'm sure we'll sign the treaty
documents within a few days. <br>
DAMAR: I haven't even seen this treaty. <br>
WEYOUN: We'll discuss it later. <br>
FOUNDER: The alliance between the Breen Confederacy and the Dominion
will end the destructive war that has torn this quadrant apart. With
the Breen at our side, the Federation will not be able to stand against
us. They'll be erased from the face of the galaxy. <br>
(After the opening titles, Damar is reading a PADD.) <br>
DAMAR: This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? <br>
WEYOUN: Parts of it. <br>
DAMAR: There's a reference to territorial concessions that the
Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those
concessions are. <br>
WEYOUN: Oh, you needn't worry about that. It's all been itemised in a
secret protocol between the Dominion and the Breen. All that is
required of you is sign the document as the acknowledged leader of the
Cardassian Union. <br>
DAMAR: I want to see this protocol. <br>
WEYOUN: It wouldn't be much of a secret then, would it? <br>
DAMAR: You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't
even seen what they are? <br>
WEYOUN: Damar, you are missing the point. We need the Breen to win this
war. When it's over, there will be more than enough territories
available to compensate Cardassia for the loss of a few minor planets. <br>
DAMAR: There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. <br>
WEYOUN: Do you know what I think you should do? Talk to Thot Gor.
Express your concerns. He's very reasonable and quite personable once
you get to know him. <br>
DAMAR: I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have
agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! <br>
WEYOUN: I'm sorry, I think I misunderstood you. It sounded as if you
were implying that Cardassian territory doesn't belong to the Founders.
Surely that isn't what you meant? <br>
DAMAR: No. Of course not. <br>
WEYOUN: Oh good. I look forward to receiving the signed documents from
you within the hour. Is there something else? <br>
DAMAR: The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. <br>
WEYOUN: I'm aware of that. <br>
DAMAR: Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The
Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. <br>
WEYOUN: I assure you the Septimus Three situation will be dealt with.
We will not allow your brave soldiers to perish in vain. You have my
word.

The Cardassian Eleventh Order. It's a reserve unit. Old men and walking
wounded. They don't stand a chance. <br>
SISKO: I think you're right. <br>
MARTOK: But enough about the war with the Dominion. I want to hear
about the war at home. You just married that freighter captain, didn't
you? <br>
SISKO: Yes. <br>
MARTOK: Then war has broken out, whether you know it or not. A long,
gruelling, intoxicating war. I remember the day my beloved Sirella
moved into my home. I had a pet targ. Had him since I was a boy. A
filthy, mangy beast, but in his bony breast beat the heart of a
warrior. Of course, Sirella loathed him. Well, to make a long story
short, while she was supervising the unloading of her bags, Sirella
accidently left the front door open, and my faithful targ, ever ready
to follow the call of the wild, tottered outside on his frail legs and
disappeared into the forest. I never laid eyes on him again. <br>
SISKO: Lady Sirella draws the first blood. <br>
MARTOK: You see my point. Don't get me wrong, I would not trade Sirella
for all the targs on Kronos. And over the course of our marriage I've
won more than my fair share of the battles between us. But in the end,
I know she will win the war. <br>
SISKO: I'll keep that in mind.

DUKAT: The good Ranjen doesn't much care for me, does he? <br>
WINN: You'd think he'd be pleased to see his Kai so happy. <br>
DUKAT: Are you happy, Adami? <br>
WINN: More than I've ever been in my life. The Prophets are smiling on
us. They've not only brought us together, but they've given us a great
task, the Restoration of Bajor. <br>
DUKAT: Our world will be reborn. And you will be its leader. <br>
WINN: It's a sacred responsibility. <br>
DUKAT: Yes. <br>
WINN: I pray that I'll have the strength to do what the Prophets are
asking of me. <br>
DUKAT: I will be at your side. We won't fail them. But the Restoration
will not come without struggle. There will be those who will stand in
our way. <br>
WINN: It is not allowed to interfere with the will of the Prophets. <br>
DUKAT: Even those who claim to speak in their name. <br>
WINN: The Emissary. <br>
DUKAT: In your vision, the Prophets said he'd faltered. <br>

is strong, but so is their wrath. </font></p>

EZRI: Probably not. <br>
WORF: We must get back to the station and warn Starfleet about the
Breen. <br>

SISKO: Well, welcome home, Mrs Sisko. <br>
KASIDY: Thank you, Mister Sisko. <br>
SISKO: So, how was your cargo run? <br>
KASIDY: Interesting. It seems my Bajoran crewmembers have decided that
serving under the wife of the Emissary is a little different than
serving under his girlfriend. I've known some of those people for ten
years or more and suddenly they're asking me for advice about their
children, their wives, their husbands, their spiritual relationship
with the Prophets. <br>
SISKO: Welcome to the club. Which reminds me. Every spring, the
Emissary holds a little ceremony to bless the women on the station who
want to be mothers. <br>
KASIDY: What does this have to do with me? <br>
SISKO: There's been a request made. Several, in fact, that the new wife
of the Emissary perform the ceremony this year. This week, actually. <br>
KASIDY: No. <br>
SISKO: Kasidy. <br>
KASIDY: No. I've got to draw the line somewhere. I married you. I
didn't convert. And I'm not going to start acting like I suddenly
believe in the Prophets. <br>
SISKO: I wouldn't want you to do anything you're uncomfortable with. <br>
KASIDY: Good. Then it's settled. I'm going to go take a sonic shower. <br>

EZRI: Yes, I'm hurt. You just cut my finger and made me hit my head! <br>
WORF: It was an accident. <br>
EZRI: I still don't see how getting a pin out of a bunk is going to
help us escape. <br>
WORF: If you would stop interfering and allow me to remove the pin, I
would show you. Let me look at your head. <br>
EZRI: No, thank you. The last time you touched me, things got a little
out of control. <br>
WORF: You are right about that. I was seduced and betrayed. <br>
EZRI: Seduced? I seduced you? <br>
WORF: At least we agree on that point. <br>
EZRI: What? <br>
WORF: You desired a physical relationship with me from the very start.
That much was obvious. <br>
EZRI: You have the biggest ego of any man I've ever known. <br>
WORF: Considering how many men you have known, that is quite a
statement. <br>
EZRI: Am I supposed to be embarrassed because Jadzia had a few lovers
before you? <br>
WORF: A few? <br>
EZRI: You're right. It was more than a few. It was dozens. Hundreds. In
fact, I don't think there was anyone aboard DS Nine who wasn't her
lover! <br>
(The door opens. It's Weyoun with Damar and two Cardassian guards.) <br>
WEYOUN: Let me take this opportunity to welcome you both to Cardassia
Prime. I trust you've been well-treated for so far? I've been looking
over the information you supplied to the Breen during your
interrogation, and the results are a bit confusing, as mental probes so
often are. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind sifting through the
data and clarifying certain issues for us. <br>
EZRI: You can't be serious. <br>
WEYOUN: I'm always serious. You see, if you don't do as I ask, I'll
have to hand you over to Legate Damar and you know how ruthless the
Cardassians can be. <br>
DAMAR: It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a
Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. <br>
EZRI: War criminals? What are the charges? <br>
DAMAR: That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is
that you will be found guilty and executed. <br>
WEYOUN: However, if you should decide to help us in our search for a
quick end to this miserable war, your sentence will be reduced to life
imprisonment. <br>
EZRI: If you want to end the war why don't you convince the Founders to
surrender? <br>
WEYOUN: You know, my dear it would be such a shame for you to die
without the good Doctor Bashir knowing how you felt about him. <br>
(Worf grabs Weyoun's head and breaks his neck. A Cardassian guard
knocks Worf down and aims his weapon.) <br>
DAMAR: Wait! <br>
(Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) <br>
DAMAR: Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders
should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just
make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's
only one Damar. <br>
WORF: I will keep that in mind. <br>
DAMAR: I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two
days. Pick that up and let's go.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SOLBOR: Colonel Kira to see you, Eminence. <br>
WINN: Come in, my child. Please sit down. Thank you for seeing me at
such a late hour. <br>
KIRA: What can I do for you? <br>
WINN: I have often sensed that you don't approve of how I conducted
myself as Kai, that you believe I put my own political interests ahead
of the spiritual well being of our people. I wish I could disagree with
that assessment. I have strayed from the path the Prophets laid down
for me. <br>
KIRA: Eminence. <br>
WINN: You don't know. You don't know. <br>
KIRA: Eminence, when you told me that the Prophets had spoken to you, I
prayed that they would open your heart, that they would change you. <br>
WINN: I want to change. I'd do anything to earn their forgiveness, nut
I'm afraid it's too late. <br>
KIRA: It's never too late. The worst of us can be redeemed. <br>
WINN: How? <br>
KIRA: I'm not a Vedek, but it seems to me that you have to set aside
the things that led you astray. Ambition, jealousy. <br>
WINN: Oh yes, I have given in to the temptations of power. <br>
KIRA: Turn away from temptation. <br>
WINN: Yes. <br>
KIRA: Give yourself over to the Prophets. <br>
WINN: I'll do whatever it takes to make myself worthy in their eyes. <br>
KIRA: Everything will change once you step down as Kai. You'll see. <br>
WINN: Step down? I don't understand. Why would I do that? Bajor needs
me. <br>
KIRA: Eminence, being in power is what led you on the wrong path. <br>
WINN: I've resolved to change. Don't you see? Once I have regained the
Prophets' trust, I'll be better able to serve them if I remain Kai. If
the Prophets wanted me to step down, surely they would have told me so.
<br>
KIRA: They don't always use words to make their wishes known. Sometimes
they speak to us by touching our hearts, but only you would know if
they had done that. <br>
WINN: But Bajor needs me. <br>
KIRA: Goodnight, Eminence.

enters.) <br>
WEYOUN: Oh, Damar, there you are. I want you to hear this. Thot Gor had
an interesting observation regarding our forces along the Romulan
border. In his view, we have failed to take advantage of several
weaknesses in their defences. <br>
DAMAR: Is that so. <br>
WEYOUN: For instance, Romulan colony in the Unroth system is ripe for
attack. Their long range sensor array is being repaired <br>
DAMAR: Septimus Three has fallen. <br>
WEYOUN: Excuse me? <br>
DAMAR: Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out.
Five hundred thousand men! <br>
WEYOUN: Oh, yes. A great tragedy. <br>
DAMAR: You promised reinforcements. <br>
WEYOUN: I promised nothing of the kind. I said the situation would be
dealt with, and it was. <br>
DAMAR: By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. <br>
WEYOUN: If you will calm down and listen, I will explain. The sacrifice
made by the Eleventh Order will not be in vain. They forced the
Klingons to commit worthwhile valuable troops and resources to capture
a strategically worthless planet. <br>
GOR: (electronic noise) <br>
WEYOUN: I'm glad you agree. <br>
DAMAR: Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians <br>
WEYOUN: If they were truly loyal Cardassian, then they died willingly
for the Dominion. There can be no greater sacrifice. <br>
DAMAR: How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? <br>
WEYOUN: Your people, Damar? We are all one with the Dominion. Vorta,
Cardassian, Jem'Hadar, the Breen. <br>
GOR: (electronic noise) <br>
WEYOUN: We all serve the Founders and we will all make whatever
sacrifices they deem necessary. Thot Gor, would you mind reiterating
your plan for the Unroth System? I seem to have lost my train of
thought. <br>
GOR: (electronic noise) <br>
(Damar leaves.) <br>
WEYOUN: Yes, I know. It's become increasingly difficult to get a full
day's work out of him.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EZRI: The Dax symbiont has lived for over three
hundred years. Experienced eight lifetimes. And now it's all going to
end with an execution on Cardassia. Ezri Tigan's contribution to the
Dax legacy will be to end it. <br>
WORF: There is no honour in self pity. <br>
EZRI: You know, Worf, I have had just about enough of your little
Klingon aphorisms. The only reason I came on this mission was to save
your miserable life, so the least you could do is stop acting like such
a self righteous targ. <br>
WORF: Your motives for rescuing me were not honourable. <br>
EZRI: Do you really think that I would disobey orders and risk my life
so I could seduce you? I hate to burst your bubble, Worf, but it wasn't
that good. <br>
WORF: Always the barb, always the joke. <br>
EZRI: There was a time when you found my sense of humour to be one of
my more endearing qualities. <br>
WORF: That was Jadzia, not you. <br>
EZRI: Are you angry at me for something that I did or because I'm not
Jadzia? Let's cut right to the heart of the matter. Do you love me? Me?
Ezri? <br>
WORF: You are trying to turn this around and make it about me. <br>
EZRI: Answer the question. Do you love me? <br>
WORF: I have made my feelings clear back on Goralis Three. <br>
EZRI: What is it, Worf? Could it be that you're feeling just a little
guilty because you don't have the same feelings for me that you did for
Jadzia? If that's true, maybe we both made a mistake back on Goralis.
So maybe we both should be forgiven. <br>
WORF: This night would be better spent preparing ourselves for the next
life, instead of rehashing the mistakes of this one. <br>
(Later, Ezri is trying to sleep.) <br>
WORF: You are right. <br>
EZRI: What? <br>
WORF: I said you are right. I do not love you as I loved Jadzia. <br>
EZRI: There's no crime in that. <br>
WORF: I dishonoured myself. I know how often I use that word. Maybe too
often. But in this case, it is appropriate. <br>
EZRI: Go on. From the first moment you came on the station, I knew you
were not Jadzia, and yet I knew that there was a part of Jadzia still
alive within you. On Goralis, I allowed myself to see her instead of
you. <br>
EZRI: I felt the same way. A part of me, the part that was your wife,
wanted very much to be close to you. <br>
WORF: I realise Jadzia saw physical love very differently than I do. To
her it could mean many things, but to me it is a deeply spiritual act.
When I made love to you, my motives were not spiritual. It was an
unworthy impulse. <br>
EZRI: Worf, we're not gods or prophets. We're people. We make mistakes.
There is one other thing I want you to know. I honestly didn't realise
how I felt about Julian. I would have never hidden something like that
from you. <br>
WORF: I believe you. And I do not hold any malice toward you or Doctor
Bashir. <br>
EZRI: That's good to know. Friends? <br>
WORF: And more. <br>
EZRI: And more. <br>
WORF: It appears all we have left to do is to be executed. <br>
EZRI: Sounds like a lazy day to me. <br>
(The door opens.) <br>
DAMAR: It's time.

DAMAR: There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A,
two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to
get you past our security checkpoints. <br>
EZRI: Why are you doing this? <br>
DAMAR: I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they
have an ally on Cardassia. <br>
WORF: Why should we trust you? <br>
DAMAR: You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. <br>
EZRI: I vote for option one.

called for him. <br>
WINN: Show him in. <br>
SOLBOR: As you wish. <br>
(Solbor sighs and leaves.) <br>
WINN: I remember the first time I saw the Gate of the Celestial Temple.
I was on the Promenade. When it burst into view, this whirlpool of
colour and light, the people around me were in awe. They said they
could feel the love of the Prophets washing over them. Do you know what
I felt, Anjohl? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. But I smiled and pretended
I did because it was expected of me. I've never admitted that to
anyone. <br>
DUKAT: I can understand why. <br>
WINN: They've never spoken to me. Never offered me guidance. Never
trusted me with the fruits of their wisdom. And now, I'm supposed to
step down as Kai in order to be blessed by them? No. I have worked too
hard, waited too long to give it all up now. <br>
DUKAT: You shouldn't have to. Merciful gods don't ask their children to
make such sacrifices. <br>
WINN: The Prophets have turned their backs on me. After all I've done
for them, all the pain I've endured for them. <br>
DUKAT: They are not worthy of you, Adami. <br>
WINN: I'm a patient woman. But I have run out of patience. I will no
longer serve gods who give me nothing in return. I'm ready to walk the
path the Pah wraiths have laid out for me. <br>
DUKAT: I'll walk with you, and no one will be able to stand against us.
<br>
WINN: Those who dare to try, the Federation and its Vedek puppets, the
false gods and their precious Emissary, they'll all be swept aside like
dead leaves before an angry wind. </font> </p>
