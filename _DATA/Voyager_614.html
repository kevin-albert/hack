Heart, heart, heart. Just one more heart. <br>

NEELIX: I don't know what you're talking about. I've, I've, this is the
first time I've played. What is it called? <br>
ALL: Poker. <br>
PARIS: Look, why don't we make things a little more interesting. Forget
the chips. Let's bet on tomorrow's work detail, all right? Whoever wins
this hand gets the morning off. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm in. <br>
KIM: I'm in. <br>
NEELIX: Sounds good to me. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What have you got? <br>

NEELIX: Does that beat a flush? <br>
KIM: I knew you were bluffing. <br>

I can't shake them. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Return fire. <br>
NEELIX: Why didn't our sensors detect them? <br>
KIM: Looks like they used a dispersal field to mask their approach.<br>

CHAKOTAY: It's all right. You were unconscious, but I don't think
you're injured. <br>
NEELIX: I was dreaming you'd been assimilated. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Your subconscious was jumping the gun, but not by much. From

PARIS: Calm? We're in a chamber of horrors or haven't you noticed? <br>

a way out. There's a forcefield around this room. Let's try to disable
it. </font></p>

Their ion trail ends directly ahead. <br>
TORRES: I'm detecting another vessel, bearing three zero, mark one one
two. It's a Borg Cube. <br>
JANEWAY: Red alert. Alter course to intercept. Adjust shields to
rotating frequencies. Have they detected us? <br>
TUVOK: Unclear. The vessel's holding position. <br>
JANEWAY: As soon as we're within sensor range, start scanning for the
away team. On screen. <br>
SEVEN: Their propulsion system is offline. The damage is not that
severe. The drones should've repaired it by now. <br>
JANEWAY: Lucky for us they didn't, or we'd never have caught up with
them. Any sign of our people? <br>TORRES: Not yet. <br>(Whumph!)<br>
TUVOK: They are targeting our warp core. Shields are holding. <br>
JANEWAY: Return fire. Aim for their weapons array. <br>
TORRES: Now they're going after our impulse engines. That one was meant
for our sensors. They can't seem to make up their minds. <br>
SEVEN: Their attack strategy is erratic, inefficient. <br>
TUVOK: And finished. We've disabled their weapons. <br>
TORRES: That was too easy. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe they're in worse shape than we thought. <br>
TUVOK: I'm picking up non-Borg life signs. One of them is definitely
Talaxian. It looks as though they haven't been assimilated yet. <br>
JANEWAY: Try to get a transporter lock. <br>
TORRES: Their shields are interfering. <br>
JANEWAY: Target their shield generator and fire. <br>
SEVEN: Captain, I believe I can explain the unusual behaviour of these
Borg. There should be thousands of drones manning the vessel, but I'm
picking up only five signatures. <br>
BORG [OC]: We are the Borg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is
futile. <br>
TORRES: It doesn't sound like they've lost their confidence. <br>
TUVOK: Their shield generators are too deep inside the vessel. Our
weapons can't reach them. <br>
JANEWAY: Open a channel. Borg vessel, this is the starship Voyager.
You're holding our crewmen. We're willing to cease firing if you return
them.<br>
BORG [OC]: Negotiation is irrelevant. You will be assimilated. <br>
JANEWAY: Not today, and not by you. Agree, or I'll resume firing. <br>
TUVOK: They are scanning us. <br>
BORG [OC]: We will return your crew members in exchange for specific
technology. <br>
TORRES: Talk about unusual behaviour. The Borg negotiating? <br>
JANEWAY: What technology?<br>
BORG [OC]: Your navigational deflector. Disengage it from your
secondary hull. <br>
JANEWAY: Mute audio. <br>
TUVOK: If we surrender our deflector, we'll be dead in space. We won't
be able to go to warp. <br>
JANEWAY: What would they want with it? <br>
SEVEN: When their communications array was damaged, it severed their
link to the Collective. They intend to adapt our deflector to regain
it. <br>
JANEWAY: And call for reinforcements? That's the last thing we need.
We'll have to stall them until we can find another way out of this. <br>(Janeway signals audio on.)<br>JANEWAY:&nbsp;I'll consider the exchange, but first I want to be certain my crewmen
are unharmed and alive. <br>
BORG [OC]: You have scanned our vessel. <br>

incomplete. You'll continue to malfunction. You must return to your

repair it alone. I can help you, but first you must release the

What have we learned from our friend here? <br>
EMH: The bigger they come, the harder they fall. Behold the David that
slew our Goliath. <br>(Micro-cellular scan 407)<br>
JANEWAY: A pathogen. <br>
EMH: A space-borne virus that adapted to Borg physiology. It's inert
now, but in its virulent state it attacked the drones and killed them. <br>
TUVOK: Why weren't the juveniles infected? <br>
SEVEN: The maturation chamber is designed to protect developing drones.
Malfunctions caused by the deaths of the adults led several of the
chambers to open prematurely. <br>
TUVOK: Does this pathogen only target the Borg? <br>
EMH: The Borg, and other cybernetic organisms it encounters. You're not
thinking of using it as a biological weapon? <br>
TUVOK: If we can revive the pathogen and reintroduce it, we could
neutralise the drones without harming the away team. <br>
EMH: Neutralise? You mean murder, don't you? Captain, they're children.
<br>
TUVOK: Need I remind you that these children have committed murder
themselves in their futile attempts to assimilate others. <br>
JANEWAY: Seven, tell me something. You saw them, talked to them. Do you
think they'll kill the hostages if we don't give them what they want? <br>
SEVEN: Yes. <br>
JANEWAY: I want that pathogen as an option, Doctor, but I won't
consider using it until I've seen these drones for myself. Think you
can arrange that? Then you're with me. </font></p>

the deflector as agreed. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe it's hard for you to accept, but you don't have to

found some unsettling information. I examined their communication
records. The Collective did receive the drones' initial distress call. <br>
JANEWAY: How long before they arrive? <br>
SEVEN: A vessel was not dispatched. The Collective declared the
neonatal drones irrelevant and severed their link to the Hive
permanently. <br>
JANEWAY: They see them as damaged, unworthy of re-assimilation. <br>
SEVEN: Precisely. <br>

JANEWAY: Once they learn they've been rejected by the Hive, they won't
need our deflector. They might be willing to release the hostages. <br>
SEVEN: Normally when drones learn they're irrelevant, they deactivate
themselves. But these neonatal drones are unpredictable. They may not
adhere to Borg protocols. <br>

they realise they have no place else to go<br>
SEVEN: If you're suggesting transforming them into individuals, that
would be extremely difficult. <br>
JANEWAY: You turned out pretty well, Seven. <br>
SEVEN: That's because I was prepared before you encountered me. <br>
JANEWAY: What do you mean? <br>
SEVEN: When I was first captured by the Borg, I was young and
frightened. I watched my parents assimilated. Then I was placed in a
maturation chamber, and the Hive mind began to restructure my synaptic
pathways, purge my individuality. When I emerged five years later, the
turmoil of my forced assimilation had been replaced with order. You may
not be aware of this, Captain, but that order continues to be a source
of strength for me. I could not have regained my humanity without it. <br>
JANEWAY: I appreciate your insights. But just because they didn't have
the benefit of your Borg upbringing doesn't mean we're going to turn
our backs on them. There has to be another way. <br>

JANEWAY: Continue the repairs aboard the Borg Cube. We'll hold onto
this information for now. <br>

SEVEN: The unity of the Collective, common goals, the quest for
perfection. I have not forgotten. But you don't need to remain drones
to experience those things. Come back with me to Voyager. <br>
LEADER: Thirty eight minutes. You're wasting time. <br>(An alarm sounds.)<br>ICHEB: Another maturation
chamber is malfunctioning. <br>(The foetus is in distress.)<br>
SEVEN: Its autonomic nervous system is failing. <br>
LEADER: It's Borg. It will adapt. <br>
MEZOTI: It's not adapting. Let Seven help. <br>
SEVEN: We can modulate the stasis field to stabilise its functions, at
least temporarily. Assist me. The field is degrading. We need to
transport it into an incubation pod. Quickly. <br>(The twins do the transport. Seven opens the pod and picks up the baby. It struggles to breathe.) <br>
MEZOTI: Why is it doing that? <br>
SEVEN: Its respiratory system is impaired, and this incubation pod is
malfunctioning. We must transport this infant to Voyager. <br>
LEADER: No. The drone is part of our Collective. <br>
ICHEB: Not if it dies. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM:
Tetryon levels are rising. I'm getting closer. <br>
TUVOK [OC]: The shield generator should be directly ahead. <br>
KIM: I see it. The first charge is in place. Tuvok? Hello? <br>
MEZOTI: You left these. <br>(She holds up Queen of Hearts.)<br>MEZOTI:&nbsp;I like her. She
looks like Seven of Nine. <br>
KIM: Is Seven your friend? You know, she's my friend, too. Maybe
someday, we <br>

How long has it been since you lost contact? <br>
TUVOK: Four or five minutes. <br>
JANEWAY: His bio-signs? <br>
EMH [OC]: Doctor to the Captain. Please report to Sickbay immediately. <br>
JANEWAY: On my way. Keep looking for him. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
What's the emergency? <br>
EMH: I thought you should see for yourself. Somebody left a bundle on
our doorstep. I turned around and there she was, lying on a bio-bed. <br>
JANEWAY: Seven must have beamed her here. <br>
EMH: Good thing, too. A few more minutes and I wouldn't have been able
to do anything for her. It's hard to believe she could grow up to be a
drone. <br>(The baby starts to cry and the EMH picks her up.)<br>EMH:&nbsp;Hold her for a moment while I take some readings. Oh, I guess
she just wanted to be held. Oh. The pathogen. I finished synthesizing
it. <br>
JANEWAY: Start working with Tuvok on a way to deploy the virus. <br>
EMH: Captain, you don't seriously plan to use it?<br>
JANEWAY: If I have to. Let's just hope your brothers and sisters don't
force my hand. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
You complain of delays then you interrupt my work. <br>
LEADER: Can you identify this? <br>
SEVEN: It's a plasma charge. <br>
LEADER: You tried to deceive us. <br>(The children step aside to reveal an unconscious Kim.)<br>LEADER: Nanoprobes were injected into his
bloodstream. He won't survive without medical attention. Call your
Captain. Tell her to give us the deflector. <br>
SEVEN: That won't be necessary. I only need a few more minutes to
repair the<br>

is futile. </font></p>

[on viewscreen]: Comply. <br>
JANEWAY: Return Harry Kim, then we'll talk. <br>
LEADER [on viewscreen]: We've talked enough. Your requests are
irrelevant. Comply or we'll assimilate the others. <br>
JANEWAY: It'll take us at least an hour to dismantle the deflector and
transfer the components. <br>
LEADER [on viewscreen]: Now. <br>
JANEWAY: I can't give it to you now. It's complex technology that's
part of our ship. We can't simply remove it. And no amount of threats
from you is going to change that. <br>(Whumph!)<br>
TUVOK: They've locked a tractor beam onto the deflector. <br>
TORRES: They're trying to tear it off. Hull stress is increasing.
Breaches on decks ten and eleven. <br>
JANEWAY: Increase shield strength and randomise the harmonics. <br>
TUVOK: They're adapting. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Maturation area]</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
Even with Voyager's deflector, your efforts to return to the Hive will
fail. <br>
LEADER: They'll come for us. <br>
SEVEN: No, they won't. The Borg received your message but chose to
ignore it. They consider you irrelevant. <br>
MEZOTI: Irrelevant? <br>
ICHEB: We are damaged. They don't want us. <br>
LEADER: Ignore her. It's another lie. <br>
SEVEN: Their reply is in data grid four two six. Use decryption
protocol theta three. <br>
LEADER: Return to your station. It's another deception. She's
manipulating us. <br>
ICHEB: The transmission is authentic. <br>
LEADER: It's a mistake. <br>
SEVEN: The Collective does not tolerate imperfection. <br>
LEADER: Then we'll assimilate more species. Prove we're worthy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TORRES:
Hull stress is reaching critical levels. <br>
JANEWAY: Reroute all emergency power to structural integrity. <br>
TORRES: That'll buy us another minute at most. <br>
TUVOK: Captain, I have found a fluctuation in their shield grid near a
plasma duct. It's too intermittent to beam out the hostages, but we
could use it to deploy the pathogen. Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Not yet. <br>
TUVOK: There is no alternative. <br>
JANEWAY: There's always an alternative. We just need to find it. Their
tractor beam draws power from the same grid as their shield matrix. If
we use the deflector to send a feedback pulse along the beam, it could
disrupt their shields. Do it. <br>
TORRES: Rerouting warp plasma. If this doesn't work it'll do more
damage to us than the Cube. <br>
JANEWAY: It'll work. Prepare to fire. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
You have no future with the Borg. But you do with Voyager. A chance to
reclaim your real lives. <br>
LEADER: What do you know about real lives? <br>
SEVEN: Does he speak for all of you? You should make your decisions
yourself, as individuals. <br>
ICHEB: They are sending a feedback pulse through our tractor beam. It's
overloading our shield matrix. <br>
LEADER: Adapt! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TUVOK:
Their tractor beam is fluctuating. Their shields are dropping. <br>
TORRES: I've got a partial lock on the away team. Boosting the
confinement beam. I've got three of them. <br>
TUVOK: Confirmed. Chakotay, Paris and Neelix are in Transporter room
two.<br>
JANEWAY: What about Seven and Harry? <br>
TORRES: They must be in a section that's still shielded. <br>
JANEWAY: Amplify the feedback pulse. </font></p>

The other captives are gone. <br>
ICHEB: The shields around this chamber are failing. Instructions. <br>
SEVEN: Lower your shields. Lower the shields! <br>(Seven goes to do it herself.)<br>
LEADER: No! <br>(The
Leader pulls Seven away from the control panel and puts the shields
back up. Then he grabs an object and goes to hit Seven over the head
with it. Icheb stops him.)<br>
ICHEB: Leave her alone. <br>
LEADER: Get back to your station. Do what I say. <br>
ICHEB: What you say? I thought we were a Collective. <br>
MEZOTI: One mind, one voice. <br>
LEADER: I protected you. Gave you order. <br>
ICHEB: Your order. Your rules. <br>
LEADER: Their feedback pulse is overloading the induction grids. <br>
SEVEN: This vessel will be destroyed. We must evacuate. <br>
LEADER: No! Assist me. <br>(An explosion sends an electric charge through the Leader.)<br>
SEVEN: You're damaged. Lie still. <br>
LEADER: We have to resist. The Collective will come for us. <br>
SEVEN: His cortical implants are depolarising. I can't help him. <br>(Mezoti kneels by her Leader.)<br>
MEZOTI: We'll find a new home. You'll see. <br>

away team is safe and sound. As for the drones, the Doctor's removed
most of their implants, leaving us with four very troubled children. </font></p>

We've sent out calls to any Brenari and Norcadian ships that might be
in the vicinity, but we haven't gotten any responses so far, and we're
still trying to figure out where the other two came from. It may take a
while. <br>
SEVEN: They could use the time. They have a great deal to learn. <br>
JANEWAY: It might help if they had someone around who knew what they're
up against. <br>
SEVEN: I've never been responsible for children. Mister Neelix would be
a wiser choice. <br>
JANEWAY: From what I've seen, you're the one they've established a
bond with. They'll be looking to you for guidance. <br>

encountered. </font></p>
