I was just praying for Bareil. What can I do for you? <br>
SISKO: This may come as somewhat of a shock, but I wanted you to hear
it from me. The First Minister of the Provisional government has died. <br>
KIRA: Kalem Apren? How? <br>
SISKO: Heart failure. He died in his sleep. <br>
KIRA: Well, I just met him once, but he seemed like he was a good man.
How soon will they appoint someone to replace him? <br>
SISKO: They have already appointed someone. The new head of the
Provisional government is Kai Winn.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: So as a result, I've transferred Ensign
Palmers back to the night watch and reassigned Crewman Donark to the
Defiant as a member of the security detachment. Starfleet is sending a
series of upgrades for our tactical computer modules next week. I've
drawn up a plan to phase in the upgrades over the course of three days.
Major. Is something wrong? <br>
KIRA: Yes. Oh, it's this whole thing with Kai Winn. I was just trying
to get used to her as spiritual leader of Bajor and now she's running
the government, Odo? <br>
ODO: Not an ideal situation. <br>
KIRA: Well I'm beginning to think that you and I are the only ones who
feel that way. No one's is opposing her in next month's elections. She
is going to be elected the First Minister for the next six years and no
one seems to care. <br>
ODO: You and I have a different perspective than most Bajorans. There's
a personal element to our feelings about her. I know that you still
blame Winn for Bareil's death. <br>
KIRA: That's part of it. This is about the future of Bajor. I can't
shake the feeling that giving Winn control of the government is a
mistake and she should be stopped. <br>
ODO: Stopped from doing what? <br>
KIRA: I don't know. Maybe, maybe I'm afraid that if she's given power,
she's never going to let go. <br>
ODO: Unfortunately that suspicion is not shared by the people of Bajor.
They still admire her as the woman who made peace with Cardassia. <br>
KIRA: Bareil made peace with Cardassia. <br>
ODO: I know that, Major. But to the rest of Bajor, Winn is the real
hero. In their eyes it took courage for her to conclude a treaty with a
race that she herself had so bitterly condemned and fought against. <br>
KIRA: I don't care what her popular image is. She is no hero. The only
thing that she cares about is her own power. Why can't people see that?
We spent so many years fighting the Cardassians. We spent so much time
hoping and praying for a Bajor that was free. Now that we won, how can
people just hand their freedom over to someone like Winn? <br>
ODO: It has been my observation that one of the prices of giving people
freedom of choice is that sometimes they make the wrong choice. </font></p>

KIRA: Yes? <br>
WINN: Hello, child. <br>
KIRA: Eminence. <br>
WINN: May I come in? <br>
KIRA: Yes. <br>
WINN: Please forgive this intrusion. I know the hour is late. <br>
KIRA: Does Commander Sisko know you're aboard the station? <br>
WINN: I'm not here to see the Emissary. I'm here to see you. <br>
KIRA: Me? <br>
WINN: Yes, child. Have you suffered a recent loss? Or are you still
mourning the death of Minister Kalem? <br>
KIRA: It's for Vedek Bareil, actually. <br>
WINN: It's been three months since Bareil left us to walk with the
Prophets. You must have cared for him deeply. <br>
KIRA: I loved him. <br>
WINN: As did I. <br>
KIRA: Is that why you never mention Bareil's name when you talk about
your peace treaty with Cardassia? As I recall, he's the one who
negotiated it. <br>
WINN: Bareil saw himself as simply carrying out the will of the
Prophets. To him, achieving peace with Cardassia was its own reward. He
never wanted fame or glory for what he did. As someone who loved him,
I'm surprised you didn't know that. <br>
KIRA: What is it you want, Eminence? <br>
WINN: Are you familiar with Rakantha Province? <br>
KIRA: It's a farming community. <br>
WINN: And it used to be one of the most productive agricultural regions
on Bajor. But as you know, the Cardassians poisoned much of our
farmlands before they left, and Rakantha has been mostly barren
wasteland ever since. After years of research, the agricultural
ministry has finally developed reclamators which can detoxify the soil
and make it fertile again. <br>
KIRA: It's very interesting, but what does it have to do with me? <br>
WINN: Patience, child. In six months, it will be planting season in
Rakantha. By this time next year, we can be producing boton, moreka and
salam grass. All valuable commodities for export. If we can attract
interstellar commerce to Bajor, it will only enhance our application
for membership in the Federation. <br>
KIRA: I understand. <br>
WINN: Unfortunately, a group of farmers who were allowed to use the
reclamators in another province are now refusing to return them. And
this is why I've come to you, Kira. The farmers who seized the
equipment are in Dahkur Province. Your home. And they're led by a man
with whom you're acquainted. His name is Shakaar. <br>
KIRA: Shakaar? <br>
WINN: And if I'm not mistaken, he was the leader of your resistance
cell during the occupation. <br>
KIRA: That's right. <br>
WINN: I want you to convince him to return the equipment he's stolen. <br>
KIRA: You want me to go up against a man who saved my life countless
times for you? <br>
WINN: Not for me, child. For Bajor. I know we've had our differences in
the past, but I'm asking you to put those feelings aside and think of
what is best for our people. We're on the verge of a new era. The
Occupation is over, we've achieved peace with Cardassia, Federation
membership is only a few years away. This is an exciting time to be a
Bajoran. But our future depends on each of us acting for the common
good of all Bajor. Shakaar has lost sight of this. By stealing the
reclamators, he's acting in his own self-interest at the expense of the
rest of our people. <br>
KIRA: I know Shakaar. He's one of the most selfless people I have ever
met. He must have a good reason for what he's done. <br>
WINN: Perhaps. Perhaps he is just misguided. That's why I've come to
you, Kira. You know him, you can talk to him. I don't want this to
become a scandal. I want this settled peacefully, quietly. Surely we
can both agree that that's a worthy goal. <br>
KIRA: I'll talk to him, but I can't guarantee that he'll listen to me. <br>
WINN: Vedek Bareil used to tell me that you could be quite persuasive
when you put your mind to it, child. I hope he wasn't mistaken. Walk
with the Prophets.

LUPAZA: (another red-headed woman) You never would've found your way
out of there if I hadn't left that marker on that rock. <br>
FUREL: (a stout one-armed man) I have a fine sense of direction. I knew
exactly where I was that night. Exactly. <br>
KIRA: I found your tracks the next day. You'd been walking in circles. <br>
FUREL: I was throwing the Cardassians off my trail. Again, please. <br>
(Kira fills his clay mug.) <br>
KIRA: Furel, if you don't mind my asking, why haven't you? <br>
FUREL: Had my arm replaced? Well, I thought about it. I even saw a
Federation doctor about it. She said, no problem, Furel. You can have a
new arm in less than a week. It'll have full range of motion and feel
just like your own. <br>
KIRA: So why didn't you do it? <br>
FUREL: Before I went into that interrogation centre, I asked the
Prophets to give me the strength to get the rest of you out of there.
And in exchange, I said I'd give up my life. As it turned out, I was
able to rescue you, Shakaar and Lupaza. It only cost me an arm. I felt
the Prophets were generous. Somehow replacing the arm seems ungrateful.
<br>
LUPAZA: I think you're just afraid that with two arms you'd actually
have to do some real work for a change. <br>
FUREL: I've done more work in three months on my farm than you've done
in three years. I have seen better weeds than the crops you grow. <br>
LUPAZA: You know good and well that my soil's more toxic than any other
tract within a hundred kilometres. <br>
FUREL: Ha! <br>
LUPAZA: It's true. Once I get a chance to use one of the reclamators
things'll change, I can promise you that. <br>
SHAKAAR: You may not get that chance, Lupaza. Nerys was sent here by
the Kai with orders to convince us to return the reclamators to the
government. <br>
FUREL: And you said no. <br>
SHAKAAR: I said I'd have to think about it. <br>
LUPAZA: There's not much to think about, Shakaar, you know that. Tell
the Kai or the First Minister or whatever she wants to be called these
days, that the answer's no. We need the reclamators and that's the end
of it. Now, who wants tuwaly pie? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Shakaar's farm]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: You know this business with the reclamators
isn't going to just go away, Shakaar. <br>
SHAKAAR: Maybe not. <br>
KIRA: Definitely not. I think you should reconsider. I know what you're
trying to do here, and I know how difficult it's been. We have to think
about what's best for Bajor. <br>
SHAKAAR: If you think giving the reclamators back to the government is
the best thing for Bajor, then you've been out on that space station
for too long. We waited three years to get the reclamators. We finally
got them two months ago and we were told that they were ours for at
least a year. The Provisional government actually did something right
for a change. Then Minister Kalem died, and the next thing we know we
get an order to return the reclamators immediately to the Rakantha
farming project. <br>
KIRA: The Rakantha project is important. If they can get it underway,
Bajor could start exporting goods again. It could start to change the
way the rest of the galaxy looks at us. They'll stop seeing us as poor
refugees and start seeing us as equals. <br>
SHAKAAR: I don't give a damn how the rest of the galaxy looks at us.
We're trying to feed our own people here and you're talking about
exports. <br>
KIRA: There must be a way to reach some kind of compromise here <br>
SHAKAAR: How? <br>
KIRA: I don't know, but maybe if you and the Kai would sit down and
talk together, maybe you can reach some kind of agreement. Some way of
sharing the equipment more fairly. If I could arrange a meeting between
the two of you, would you at least agree to sit down talk with her
about it? <br>
SHAKAAR: I don't know if it'll accomplish anything. <br>
KIRA: It might not, but it's a place to start. <br>
SHAKAAR: All right. For you. It's good to have you home, Nerys. You
should come back more often. <br>

WINN: And have you convinced him to return the soil reclamators? <br>
KIRA: He's not ready to return them yet. <br>
WINN: I see. When can we expect the return of the equipment? <br>
KIRA: When the topsoil in Dahkur Province has been restored and readied
for planting. Another six months. <br>
WINN: In six months, the planting season in Rakantha will be over. <br>
KIRA: I realise that, and I know how important the Rakantha project is,
which is why I've arranged a meeting between the two of you. <br>
WINN: A meeting? <br>
KIRA: Yes. To work out a compromise. If you just hear him out and look
at the work they've been able to accomplish in Dahkur in just two
months, you'll see how important this is to them. I'm sure there's a
way to resolve this situation so that both Rakantha and Dahkur can
benefit. <br>
WINN: Did you explain to Shakaar that you were there on the direct
authority of the First Minister? <br>
KIRA: Yes, but it wouldn't have mattered if I were there on behalf of
the Prophets themselves. He wasn't about to just give up the equipment.
<br>
WINN: A pity. Shakaar sounds like a prideful and arrogant man. It also
seems there's no reasoning with him. <br>
KIRA: Shakaar is not an unreasonable man. He's desperate. They all are.
You should see what they're up against. The condition of the soil, the
harsh weather. I'm sure if you talk to him, you'll be able to work out
a compromise. <br>
WINN: It would seem that I have little choice. <br>
KIRA: So I can tell him that you'll discuss it with him? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WINN: Emissary, I'm so happy you came to consult
with me. <br>
SISKO: Frankly, I'm surprised you wanted my advice. <br>
WINN: The advice of the Emissary is always welcome. But what I need is
your help. <br>
SISKO: What kind of help? <br>
WINN: It's been two weeks since I was forced to send the militia into
Dahkur Province. <br>
SISKO: And? <br>
WINN: And they've yet to catch sight of Shakaar or any of his
followers, let alone take them into custody. <br>
SISKO: I guess now you know how the Cardassians must have felt. <br>
WINN: The point is, I can't let this go on much longer. It embarrasses
me to say this, but Shakaar's defiance seems to be catching on in some
of the other Provinces, and I've had to take certain unfortunate
actions to maintain order. <br>
SISKO: You mean declaring martial law and suspending local government
in the hill provinces? <br>
WINN: I wasn't aware that you kept such close watch on the Bajoran
political situation. <br>
SISKO: From what I understand, Shakaar is gaining support all over
Bajor. <br>
WINN: Is that what Major Kira's been telling you? <br>
SISKO: I haven't spoken with Major Kira in quite some time. <br>
WINN: Emissary, I don't want this issue to divide my people. <br>
SISKO: Then I advise withdrawing your troops from Dahkur. <br>
WINN: I'm more than willing to do that, on one condition. <br>
SISKO: And what might that be? <br>
WINN: I'd like you to provide a Federation security force to take their
place. <br>
SISKO: You want me to bring in Shakaar for you. <br>
WINN: Such an act would do much to solidify the relations between the
Federation and Bajor. <br>
SISKO: I wasn't aware that our relationship needed solidifying. <br>
WINN: Nevertheless, this would be an opportunity for the Federation to
once again show it's friendship for Bajor. <br>
SISKO: I'm sorry, but I'm afraid Federation law prevents me from
interfering in Bajoran internal affairs. <br>
WINN: So, you're refusing my request for aid? <br>
SISKO: I suppose I am. <br>
WINN: If Bajor cannot depend on the Federation, we'll withdraw our
application for membership. <br>
SISKO: That would be an unfortunate overreaction on your part. If I may
say so, your entire response to this crisis has been an overreaction.
By using the militia against your own people, you're risking civil war
over a couple of soil reclamators. <br>
WINN: I'm afraid you can't see what's really going on here. This isn't
about soil reclamators. This is about the future of our society. When
someone like Shakaar can defy the law and escape punishment, we risk
descending into anarchy and chaos. This is a test, a test by the
Prophets. They want to see if I'm worthy of the role they've given me
as First Minister and Kai. I will not fail them. I will stop Shakaar by
any means necessary.

SHAKAAR: Move, move, move! <br>
FUREL: They're closing. Seventy five metres. <br>
SHAKAAR: Come on, Kira. <br>
KIRA: I've almost got it. <br>
(Kira keeps working a piece of machinery.) <br>
LUPAZA: They're on the ridge. <br>
(A Bajoran troop is coming down towards them, scanning as they go.) <br>
SHAKAAR: Kira, if you can't do it, tell me now. <br>
KIRA: I got it. <br>
(She plants the device in the ground.) <br>
TROOP: New reading. Seven hundred metres that way. <br>
TROOP 2: Yes, sir. <br>
LEADER: Let's go. <br>
SHAKAAR: How long do we have? <br>
KIRA: I've projected the false life signs about seven hundred metres
past that ravine. It'll take them about an hour to cover that distance,
and another fifteen to realise what's happened. <br>
FUREL: Either I'm getting older or these mountains are getting higher. <br>
LUPAZA: The next time I start getting nostalgic for the old days, shoot
me. <br>
FUREL: If you insist. <br>
(The troop disappear over the ridge again.) <br>
SHAKAAR: They're good. <br>
KIRA: Half of them are from Dahkur Province. They know this terrain
almost as well as we do. <br>
SHAKAAR: I think you're right. We need to leave Dahkur. They'll box us
in if we stay much longer. <br>
KIRA: We could take Serpent's Ridge up to Ratosha Pass, head for Lonar
Province. <br>
SHAKAAR: Serpent's Ridge is pretty rugged territory. <br>
KIRA: I don't think we have much choice. <br>
FUREL: Yes, we do. We can turn and fight. <br>
LUPAZA: He's right, Shakaar. It's just like in the old days. Every once
in a while the Cardassians would get too close and we'd turn around and
give them a bloody nose. <br>
SHAKAAR: Sometimes it was our nose that got bloodied. <br>
FUREL: We were willing to take the chance. I'll follow whatever orders
you give, but I am tired of running. <br>
SHAKAAR: Kira? <br>
KIRA: I'm not sure we can keep up this pace. <br>
SHAKAAR: All right. We head for Tanis Canyon. Kira's on point, column
of twos behind her. Lupaza, you take up the rear. <br>
FUREL: There is no way out of Tanis Canyon <br>
SHAKAAR: And that's why we're going to lead those militia troops in
there. Because we're going to be waiting for them. Let's move.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The rebels are on the ridge as the troops enter
the box canyon.) <br>
SHAKAAR: I don't think they've picked us up on their tricorders. <br>
KIRA: They won't, either. Not with that dampening field in place. I
think I recognise that man. <br>
SHAKAAR: Which one? <br>
KIRA: The colonel. That's Lenaris Holem. <br>
SHAKAAR: Lenaris? From the Ornathia resistance cell. <br>
KIRA: I met him at a reception in the Capital about a year ago. <br>
SHAKAAR: He's good. No wonder we haven't lost them. We have to get him
with the first volley. You take the Lieutenant on the right. I'll take
Lenaris. <br>
(They take aim, but neither can squeeze the trigger.) <br>
KIRA: I can't. I'm sorry. <br>
SHAKAAR: Don't be. I can't either. <br>
(Kira and Shakaar stand up.) <br>
LENARIS: Hold. <br>
(Kira and Shakaar walk down the slope.) <br>
LENARIS: Set a perimeter and watch the hills. Nobody fires until I give
the order. <br>
TROOP: Aye, sir. Firing positions, hold. <br>
LENARIS: That's far enough. Shakaar? <br>
KIRA: Kira Nerys. <br>
LENARIS: We've met. I've wanted to thank you for a long time. I had a
brother at Gallitep when you liberated the camp. <br>
SHAKAAR: A lot of people did. I just wish we'd gotten there sooner. <br>
LENARIS: Well. I take it from your calm demeanour that I've walked into
an ambush. I should have stayed up on the ridge line, never come down
into the valley. <br>
SHAKAAR: It's an easy mistake to make. You thought we were another two
kilometres ahead so you tried to make up time. I might have done the
same thing. <br>
LENARIS: I think I should tell you I've been in worse situations. <br>
SHAKAAR: The Pullock Five raid. <br>
LENARIS: You know about that? <br>
SHAKAAR: The first offworld raid against the Cardassians? Of course. It
was a bold move. <br>
LENARIS: If you know about Pullock Five, then you should also know I
won't give up without a fight. If you're here to ask me to surrender,
you're wasting your time. <br>
SHAKAAR: That's not why I'm here. I want to take my people and walk out
of here. I want to take them home. <br>
(One of the troopers fires at Furel.) <br>
SHAKAAR: Wait! <br>
KIRA: Stop! No one shoot! No one shoot! <br>
LENARIS: Cease fire! Cease fire! <br>
TROOPER: Sir, I saw someone. I thought they were going to open fire. <br>
LENARIS: Lieutenant. Take this man's weapon and get him off the
perimeter. Now, I believe you were saying something about wanting to
walk out of here? <br>
SHAKAAR: That's right. <br>
LENARIS: You know that's impossible. <br>
KIRA: Well we'd better find a way to make it possible, because the next
time someone starts shooting, we won't be able to stop it. And I'm not
talking about today. I'm talking about tomorrow and the next day and
the next. I am talking about the beginning of a civil war. <br>
SHAKAAR: I didn't fight the Cardassians for twenty five years just so I
could start shooting other Bajorans. <br>
LENARIS: Neither did I. So, what do we do about it?

LENARIS: They're not my prisoners. <br>
WINN: What do you mean, they're not your prisoners? What's going on? <br>
SHAKAAR: I'm here to enter the election as a candidate for the office
of First Minister. <br>
WINN: You have an interesting sense of humour. <br>
KIRA: It's no joke. Shakaar is going to enter the election and you are
going to lose. <br>
LENARIS: I've consulted with the other army commands, and he has their
full support. <br>
WINN: So this is a coup? <br>
KIRA: No, it's a free election. If you want to run, go ahead. But if
you do, this entire incident is going to be made public. And when the
people know the real facts, when they know you risked a civil war over
a couple of pieces of farm equipment, they're never going to trust you
again. You'll still be Kai, the spiritual leader of Bajor. But your
days in this office are numbered. So if I were you, I'd start packing. </font></p>
