</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Captain
Janeway has abandoned her Victorian gothic holonovel for something more Renaissance.) <br>
DA VINCI: The Cardinal is a thief. I delivered two portraits of his
mindless nephew more than three months ago, to be depicted in the
heroic mode of an Hercules or an Achilles, so specified our contract. I
complied, making that young fool of a nephew look far more heroic than
nature ever intended. An act on my part far greater than anything
accomplished by Hercules or Achilles! And what have I, the divine
Leonardo Da Vinci received in payment? <br>
JANEWAY: The Cardinal's eternal gratitude? <br>
DA VINCI: Essatto! In other words, Signorina, less than nothing. <br>
JANEWAY: All the more reason why you should accept my proposal. <br>
DA VINCI: Money is beside the point, Signorina. Catarina, is it? <br>
JANEWAY: Yes. I'm only asking for a corner, one bench, a place to work
on my own projects, paintings, sculptures. Just being here in your
company is inspiring to me. <br>
DA VINCI: Flattery, Catarina, is also beside the point. Besides, I
prefer my solitude. Scusi. <br>
(He activates a clockwork arm.) <br>
DA VINCI: Meraviglioso. <br>
JANEWAY: What will you call it? <br>
DA VINCI: The Arm of Hephaestos. <br>
JANEWAY: The god of the forge. <br>
DA VINCI: Every blacksmith who has ever swung a hammer will thank me
for this creation. <br>
JANEWAY: Someone once said all invention is but an extension of the
body of man. <br>
DA VINCI: Do not think that just because I have enjoyed your visit
today, that I am prepared to turn my workshop into a traveller's inn. <br>
(The clockwork arm stops.) <br>
DA VINCI: Che catzo. <br>
JANEWAY: Here, let me help you. <br>
DA VINCI: You will get your hands covered with goose grease. <br>
JANEWAY: It's good for the skin. <br>
(One of the wooden cogs has fractured.) <br>
DA VINCI: Let us see if we can find his big brother. Hopefully he will
be stronger. <br>
(Janeway picks up one of his sketches, not the preliminary for the portrait of
Lisa Gherardini.) <br>
JANEWAY: This looks like a flying machine. <br>
DA VINCI: I though that because my imagination took flight so easily,
my body could do the same. I was wrong. <br>
JANEWAY: It's this flapping approach. You designed your machine to
mimic the way a bat or a sparrow flies. <br>
DA VINCI: Yes, yes. So? <br>
JANEWAY: So what if you based it on the hawk, instead? <br>
DA VINCI: The hawk. A creature that glides through the air. <br>
JANEWAY: Essatto. <br>
DA VINCI: We will design a new machine, and you, Catarina, will help me
fly it. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll need someplace to work. <br>
DA VINCI: A corner? One workbench? <br>
JANEWAY: That will be fine. <br>
DA VINCI: Ten scudi per week and you provide your own materials. <br>
JANEWAY: Seven. And I might need to borrow a few things, on occasion. <br>
DA VINCI: Then we have an agreement. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Chakotay to Janeway. <br>
JANEWAY: Go ahead. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Captain, we need you in Engineering. There's something
here you should see. <br>
JANEWAY: On my way. Computer, end programme.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
What have you got? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Some bad news. The long range probe we sent out two months
ago has stopped transmitting. <br>
TORRES: At first I thought it was a problem with the communications
grid, then I cleared up the last few seconds of telemetry. Take a look
at this. <br>
(The probe was taken inside a Borg cube.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: This could be it, Captain. Borg space.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Briefing
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
We don't know exactly how many vessels are out there. but their space
appears to be vast. It includes thousands of solar systems, all Borg.
We are no doubt entering the heart of their territory. There's no going
around it, but there may be a way through it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Before the probe was disabled, it picked up a narrow corridor
of space devoid of Borg activity. We've nicknamed it the Northwest
Passage. <br>
TORRES: Unfortunately, the passage is filled with intense gravimetric
distortions. probably caused by a string of quantum singularities. <br>
PARIS: Better to ride the rapids than face the hive. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Exactly. We're going to set a course for that corridor. and
go into full Tactical Alert. Where do we stand with weapons? <br>
TUVOK: I have reprogrammed the phaser banks to a rotating modulation,
but I suspect a Borg vessel will adapt quickly. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We can use every edge. Ensign? <br>
KIM: I've already configured the long range sensors to scan for
transwarp signatures. An early warning system. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Good work. Doctor, how are you coming on the medical front? <br>
EMH: I've analysed every square millimetre of the Borg corpse we
recovered three months ago. I'm closer to understanding how their
assimilation technology works, and I might be able to create some sort
of medical defence. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Redouble your efforts. This is your top priority. Neelix, I
doubt we can resupply the ship any time soon. <br>
NEELIX: No problem, sir. I'm working on a plan to extend our food and
replicator rations. <br>
JANEWAY: We have to act fast. The Borg have captured one of our probes.
They know we're out here. We'll do everything in our power to avoid a
direct confrontation. but if and when we do engage the Borg, I'm
confident that we'll be ready. I have faith in each and every one of
you. Let's do it.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH:
These injection tubules are the first step in the Borg assimilation
process. Once inside the skin, they release a series of nanoprobes into
the bloodstream. <br>
KES: Maybe we can develop some kind of protective shielding against
them. <br>
EMH: Unlikely. The tubules are capable of penetrating any known alloy
or energy field. Which means our battle must be waged inside the body
itself. <br>
(Image enhancement 047.) <br>
The first tissue to be attacked by the nanoprobes is the victim's
blood. Assimilation is almost instantaneous. <br>
KES: They take over the blood cell functions like a virus. <br>
EMH: Which suggests to me that we should try to enhance the immune
system. Create an assimilation antibody, as it were. I doubt we can
actually destroy the nanoprobes, but we might be able to slow them
down. Let's try a submicron dissection on the probes we've
collected so far, see if we can discover the assimilation mechanism. <br>
(Kes gets a vision of a pile of dead Borg.) <br>
EMH: Kes, is something wrong? Kes? <br>

experienced several telepathic visions about the death of Borg and the
destruction of Voyager. <br>

JANEWAY: I'd like to see a tactical update. <br>

last night. Join me for dinner? <br>
JANEWAY: No thanks, I'm not hungry. And I've got a lot of work to do. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I see. <br>
JANEWAY: I've been looking through the personal log entries of all the
Starfleet Captains who encountered the Borg. I've gone over every
engagement, from the moment Q flung the Enterprise into the path of
that first Cube to the massacre at Wolf 359. Every battle, every
skirmish. anything that might give me an insight into the mind of the
Collective. <br>
CHAKOTAY: And? <br>
JANEWAY: In the words of Jean-Luc Picard. 'In their Collective state,
the Borg are utterly without mercy, driven by one will alone: the will
to conquer. They are beyond redemption, beyond reason.' And then
there's Captain Amasov of the Endeavour. 'It is my opinion that the
Borg are as close to pure evil as any race we've ever encountered.'
What's so funny? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Nothing. <br>
JANEWAY: You're smiling. Obviously, I've said something amusing. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You sounded just like Amasov. <br>
JANEWAY: What? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Just now, while you were reading his log. You were using his
inflections. <br>
JANEWAY: I did not. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes, you were. And before that, you were doing a pretty good
Picard. <br>
JANEWAY: Was I? <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's nothing to be ashamed about. Echoing the Greats. Ensign
Hickman in Astrophysics does a passable Janeway. <br>
JANEWAY: If we manage to survive the next few days, I'm going to have a
little chat with Ensign Hickman. Imitating the Captain, huh? Surely
that violates some kind of Starfleet protocol. This day was inevitable.
We all knew it. And we've all tried to prepare ourselves for the
challenge ahead. But at what point is the risk too great? At what point
do we come about and retreat to friendly territory? Could the crew
accept living out the rest of their lives in the Delta Quadrant? I keep
looking to all these Captains, my comrades in arms. But the truth is,
I'm alone. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If that moment comes. we'll face it together. And we'll make
the right decision. You're not alone, Kathryn. <br>
JANEWAY: Three years ago, I didn't even know your name. Today I can't
imagine a day without you. <br>

high concentrations of antimatter particles. It looks like a warp
propulsion system of some kind. <br>

contaminating the chest wound is now infusing every system in his body.

JANEWAY: He's still conscious, Doctor. <br>
EMH: I tried giving him a sedative, but it was rejected immediately. In
fact, every treatment I've tried has been neutralised within seconds.
These are alien cells. Each one contains more than a hundred times the
DNA of a human cell. It's the most densely coded life form I've ever
seen. Even I would need years to decipher it. <br>
JANEWAY: They have an extraordinary immune response. Anything that
penetrates the cell membrane, chemical, biological, technological, it's
all instantly destroyed. That's why the Borg can't assimilate them. <br>
EMH: Resistance in this case is far from futile. Nevertheless, I
believe Borg technology holds the key to saving Mister Kim. <br>
JANEWAY: How so? <br>
EMH: I hope to unleash an army of modified Borg nanoprobes into his
bloodstream, designed to target and eradicate the infection. As you
know, I've been analysing the nanoprobes. They're efficient little
assimilators, one can't help but admire the workmanship. But they're no
match for the alien cells. So I successfully dissected a nanoprobe and
managed to access its re-coding mechanism. I reprogrammed the probe to
emit the same electrochemical signatures as the alien cells. That way,
the probe can do its work without being detected. Observe. The alien
cells are completely oblivious to probe until it's too late.
Unfortunately, I've only created a few prototypes. I'll need several
days to modify enough nanoprobes to cure Ensign Kim. <br>

ourselves a nice planet here in the Delta Quadrant and giving up on

Maestro? Leonardo? <br>
DA VINCI: Catarina. Buona sera. <br>
JANEWAY: Am I disturbing you? <br>
DA VINCI: What do you see? <br>
JANEWAY: A wall with candlelight reflecting on it. Why? What do you
see? <br>
DA VINCI: A flock of starlings, the leaves of an oak, a horse's tail, a
thief with a noose around his neck. And a wall with the candlelight
reflecting on it. There are times, Catarina, when I find myself
transfixed by a shadow on the wall, or the splashing of water against a
stone. I stare at it, the hours pass, the world around me drops away,
replaced by worlds being created and destroyed by my imagination. A way
to focus the mind. Sit, and tell me why you have come. <br>
JANEWAY: There's a path before me. The only way home. And on either
side, mortal enemies bent on destroying each other. If I attempt to
pass through them I'll be destroyed as well. But if I turn around, that
would end all hope of ever getting home. And no matter how much I try
to focus my mind, I can't see an alternative. <br>
DA VINCI: When one's imagination cannot provide an answer, one must
seek a greater imagination. There are times when even I find myself
kneeling in prayer. I must deliver a bronzetto to the Monks at Santa

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
An alliance with the Borg? <br>
JANEWAY: More like an exchange. We offer them a way to defeat their new
enemy and in return we get safe passage through their space. In
developing a treatment for Harry, the Doctor has found a way to attack
the aliens at a microscopic level. <br>
EMH: It's still in the experimental stages, Captain. I've only made a
few prototypes. <br>
JANEWAY: Nevertheless, if we teach the Borg how to modify their own
nanoprobes, they'd have a blueprint to create a weapon to fight the
aliens. <br>
EMH: In theory, yes. <br>
JANEWAY: B'Elanna, it's clear from the Borg database that they know
practically nothing about Species 8472. <br>
TORRES: That's right. The Borg gain knowledge through assimilation.
What they can't assimilate, they can't understand. <br>
JANEWAY: But we don't assimilate. We investigate. And in this case,
that's given us an edge. We've discovered something they need. <br>
NEELIX: But the Borg aren't exactly known for their diplomacy. How can
we expect them to cooperate with us? <br>
KES: Normally, the answer would be no. But if what I've learned from
the aliens is true, the Borg are losing this conflict. <br>
JANEWAY: In one regard, the Borg are no different than we are. They're
trying to survive. I don't believe they're going to refuse an offer
that will help them do that. <br>
TUVOK: What makes you think the Borg won't attempt to take the
information by assimilating Voyager and its crew. <br>
JANEWAY: That won't get them anywhere. Doctor, you're the only one on
board with full knowledge of the nanoprobe modifications. I want you to
transfer all of that research into your holomatrix. <br>
EMH: Certainly. <br>
JANEWAY: You're my guarantee. If the Borg threaten us in any way, we'll
simply erase your programme. But it won't come to that, Doctor. It's in
the Collective's own interest to cooperate. Voyager is only one ship.
Our safe passage is a small price to pay for what we're offering in
exchange. B'Elanna, assist the Doctor with his transfer. <br>
TORRES: Aye, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Paris, locate the nearest Borg vessel and lay in a
course. They shouldn't be difficult to find. <br>
PARIS: Yes, ma'am. <br>
JANEWAY: Dismissed. <br>
(Everyone leaves except Chakotay.) <br>
JANEWAY: You were awfully quiet. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I didn't want the others to hear this, but I think what
you're proposing is too great a risk. <br>
JANEWAY: How so? <br>
CHAKOTAY: There's a story I heard as a child, a parable, and I never
forgot it. A scorpion was walking along the bank of a river, wondering
how to get to the other side. Suddenly he saw a fox. He asked the fox
to take him on his back across the river. The fox said no. If I do that
you'll sting me, and I'll drown. The scorpion assured him. If I did
that, we'd both drown. So the fox thought about it and finally agreed.
So the scorpion climbed up on his back, and the fox began to swim. But
halfway across the river, the scorpion stung him. As the poison filled
his veins, the fox turned to the scorpion and said why did you do that?
Now you'll drown too. I couldn't help it, said the scorpion. It's my
nature. <br>
JANEWAY: I understand the risk, and I'm not proposing that we try to
change the nature of the beast, but this is a unique situation. To our
knowledge, the Borg have never been so threatened. They're vulnerable.
I think we can take advantage of that. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Even if we do somehow negotiate an exchange, how long will
they keep up their end of the bargain? It could take months to cross
Borg territory. We'd be facing thousands of systems, millions of
vessels. <br>
JANEWAY: But only one Collective, and we've got them over a barrel. We
don't need to give them a single bit of information, not until we're
safe. We just need the courage to see this through to the end. <br>
CHAKOTAY: There are other kinds of courage. Like the courage to accept
that there are some situations beyond your control. Not every problem
has an immediate solution. <br>
JANEWAY: You're suggesting we turn around. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes. We should get out of harm's way. Let them fight it out.
In the meantime, there's still plenty of Delta Quadrant left to
explore. We may find another way home. <br>
JANEWAY: Or we may find something else. Six months, a year down the
road, after Species 8472 gets through with the Borg, we could find
ourselves back in the line of fire, and we'll have missed the window of
opportunity that exists right here, right now. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How much is our safety worth? <br>
JANEWAY: What do you mean? <br>
CHAKOTAY: We'd be giving an advantage to a race guilty of murdering
billions. We'd be helping the Borg assimilate yet another species just
to get ourselves back home. It's wrong! <br>
JANEWAY: Tell that to Harry Kim. He's barely alive thanks to that
species. Maybe helping to assimilate them isn't such a bad idea. We
could be doing the Delta Quadrant a favour. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't think you really believe that. I think you're
struggling to justify your plan, because your desire to get this crew
home is blinding you to other options. I know you, Kathryn. Sometimes
you don't know when to step back. <br>
JANEWAY: Do you trust me, Chakotay? <br>
CHAKOTAY: That isn't the issue. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, but it is. Only yesterday you were saying that we'd face
this together, that you'd be at my side. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I still have to tell you what I believe. I'm no good to you
if I don't do that. <br>
JANEWAY: I appreciate your insights, but the time for debate is over.
I've made my decision. Now, do I have your support? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You're the Captain. I'm the First Officer. I'll follow your
orders. That doesn't change my belief that we're making a fatal
mistake. <br>

CHAKOTAY: Not yet. I've sealed off decks nine through thirteen and posted security details at every access point.<br>

EMH: The plasma burns to her thoracic region I can treat, and I've
already stopped the internal bleeding. But her neural injuries are
going to require some creative thinking.<br>
TUVOK: Before we beamed out, an alien energy discharge struck very near the Captain.<br>
EMH: Well, it appears to have disrupted all her neuroelectrical pathways. I'll have to induce a coma to protect her higher brain
functions. But I must tell you, unless I can repair the damage, she may never regain consciousness.<br>

CHAKOTAY: I'd say so.<br>
SEVEN: The loss of our vessel requires that we modify our agreement.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I've been giving that some thought. I'm willing to let you
stay on board. We'll continue to work with you on the weapon. Once
we're safely out of Borg territory we'll give you the nanoprobes, shake
hands and part company.<br>
SEVEN: Insufficient. Our latest tactical projections indicate that the
war will be lost by then. The nearest Borg vessel is forty light years
away. You will reverse course and take us to it.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Even at maximum warp, that's a five day journey in the wrong
direction. We're supposed to be heading out of Borg space, not deeper
into it.<br>
SEVEN: There is no alternative.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Look, I'll honour the original agreement, but I'm not turning this ship around. It's too dangerous.<br>

CHAKOTAY: A five day trip back into the heart of Borg territory. It's
too risky. With those drones and the nanoprobes on board, we might as
well have a
bull's-eye painted on our hull. We're a prime target for Species 8472.
We'd never survive another attack.<br>
NEELIX: What is the alternative?<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm going to end this alliance here and now. We're going to
drop the Borg off on the next uninhabited planet, give them the
nanoprobes and take our chances alone. They can wait for a Borg ship to
pick them up and finish the weapon. I'm in command now and I have to do
what I think is best for this crew. Tom, I want you to scan for the
nearest uninhabited planet and set a course. <br>

around. You're getting what you wanted. I suggest we part ways amicably.<br>
SEVEN: There is another option. We could assimilate your vessel.<br>
CHAKOTAY: If a single drone steps one millimetre out of that Cargo Bay,
I'll decompress the entire deck. You won't pose much of a threat
floating in space.<br>
SEVEN: When your Captain first approached us, we suspected that an
agreement with humans would prove impossible to maintain. You are
erratic, conflicted, disorganised. Every decision is debated, every
action questioned. Every individual entitled to their own small

SEVEN: We must prepare this ship for the altercation. We will construct a complement of biomolecular warheads. <br>

What's the matter, our galaxy wasn't big enough for you? You had to
conquer new territory? But this race fought back. A species as
malevolent as your own.<br>
SEVEN: Species 8472 was more resistant than we anticipated. Their
technology is biogenically engineered. It is superior to that of all
species we have previously encountered.<br>
TUVOK: Which is precisely what you wanted.<br>
SEVEN: They are the apex of biological evolution. Their assimilation would have greatly added to our own perfection. <br>
TUVOK: So instead of assimilating these aliens you opened a door for them to our galaxy. <br>
SEVEN: There is only one course of action. Destroy them first. My
subspace link to the Collective has been weakened by the
interdimensional rift. We cannot signal for help. We are alone. We must
construct a compliment of biomolecular warheads and modify your
weapons to launch them.<br>

JANEWAY: The Doctor brought me up to speed, but he couldn't tell me what I really wanted to know. Why?<br>
CHAKOTAY: The Collective ordered me to reverse course, travel forty light years back the way we came. What would you have done?<br>
JANEWAY: I probably would've reversed course. Maintained the alliance as long as possible.<br>
CHAKOTAY: In my mind, the alliance was already over.<br>
JANEWAY: You never trusted me. You never believed this would work. You
were just waiting for an opportunity to circumvent my orders.<br>

JANEWAY: And so did I.<br>
CHAKOTAY: They have taking advantage of us from day one.<br>
JANEWAY: We made concessions, so did they.<br>
CHAKOTAY: They lied. The Borg started the war with Species 8472. We've
only got one Borg left to worry about. We should try to disable her and
get back to the Delta Quadrant. We might be able to duplicate the
deflector protocols they used to open a singularity.<br>
JANEWAY: No. I won't be caught tinkering with the deflector when those
aliens attack. There's no other way out of this, Chakotay. It's too
late for opinions, it's too late for discussion. It's time to make the
call, and I'm making it. We fight the aliens in full cooperation with
the Borg.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I was linked to a Collective once, remember? I had a
neurotransceiver embedded in my spine. I know who we're dealing with.
We've got to get rid of that last Borg and take our chances alone.<br>
JANEWAY: It won't work. This isn't working either. There are two wars
going on. The one out there, and the one in here, and we're losing both
of them.<br>
CHAKOTAY: It will be your undoing.<br>
JANEWAY: What?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Our conflicted nature. Our individuality. Seven of Nine said
that we lack the cohesion of a Collective mind. That one day it would
divide us and destroy us. And here we are, proving her point.<br>
JANEWAY: I'll tell you when we lost control of this situation, when we
made our mistake. It was the moment we turned away from each other. We
don't have to stop being individuals to get through this, we just have
to stop fighting each other.

we're going to fight this battle, I intend to win it.<br>

JANEWAY: Good. This is the plan. We engage the enemy here, in their
space. We show them what they're up against. If they have any sense of
self-preservation, they'll back off, pull their ships out of the Delta
Quadrant. That's provided the weapons are effective. If they
aren't, it's been nice working with you. We've got to get this ship

destroy them at the cellular level. If they don't stop their attacks on

SEVEN: All remaining bioships in the Delta Quadrant are returning to their realm. The Borg have prevailed. <br>
JANEWAY: With a little help from us. Now it's time you fulfilled your
end of the agreement. Tell the Collective we expect safe passage from
here on out. We'll give you a shuttlecraft. You can head for the
nearest Borg ship. <br>
