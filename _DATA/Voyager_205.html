CHAKOTAY: Anything? <br>
TORRES: Not really. The polyferranide deposits are contaminated with
astaline. <br>
TUVOK: Commander, there's something over here I think you should see. <br>
CHAKOTAY: (to Torres) Pack it up. We'll find better quality somewhere
down the line. <br>
TORRES: That line is going to be cut short when our nacelles burn
themselves up if we don't find it soon. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What have you got, Lieutenant? <br>
TUVOK: There have been other visitors to this moon recently. <br>
NEELIX: What do you think this is? Some kind of message? <br>

KOLOPAK: I don't want you to go wandering off. <br>
YOUNG CHAKOTAY: I'm not. I'm just looking at something. <br>
KOLOPAK: Antonio. <br>
(Kolopak speaks the local language to their one of their guides.
Antonio replies in the same language.) <br>
KOLOPAK: He says you're quite a scout, a kep-o-ne. <br>
YOUNG CHAKOTAY: I was just looking at a lizard when I saw it. <br>
KOLOPAK: Well, it was your eyes that saw it. No one else's did. That's
the important thing. Come. I want you to understand this. It's a
blessing to the land, an ancient healing symbol. A chamozi. They
probably cut this down for firewood. <br>
YOUNG CHAKOTAY: The Rubber Tree People? <br>
KOLOPAK: Well, the closest thing to the ancient Rubber Tree People that
we'll ever see. The people in this tribe are their descendants, just
like we are. But they never left this jungle, and they rarely
intermarry with other tribes. <br>
YOUNG CHAKOTAY: And they still use firewood instead of magnesite fuel
like everyone else. <br>
KOLOPAK: Chakotay, they have chosen to live like this for centuries.
That's why we are travelling on foot and not using a transporter. We
honour the Sky Spirits who led our ancestors to this sacred land. <br>
YOUNG CHAKOTAY: Sacred land? <br>
KOLOPAK: Yes. <br>
YOUNG CHAKOTAY: Huh. The Sky Spirits must have taken a wrong turn
somewhere. </font></p>

Maybe it's a blessing to the land, for damaging it with the campfire. <br>

EMH: Describe the nature of your pain. <br>
WILDMAN: In the lower back. It's tight. <br>
EMH: Choose the word that would best describe your pain. Burning,
throbbing, piercing, pinching, biting, stinging, shooting <br>
WILDMAN: Shooting. It even goes down my legs. <br>
EMH: Hmm. <br>
WILDMAN: Is the baby all right? <br>
EMH: Hmm? Oh, certainly. Fine. Nothing to worry about. <br>
WILDMAN: Well, that makes me feel better. <br>
EMH: The position of the baby is simply putting pressure on your
sciatic nerve. You may return to your post. <br>
WILDMAN: The pain makes it difficult to sit for any period of time.
It's really quite uncomfortable. <br>
EMH: Elevating your legs when you sit should provide all the relief you
need. <br>
KES: Perhaps a day of rest, off duty. <br>
EMH: Mmm. Ensign Wildman, according to your medical history, this is
your first pregnancy, correct? <br>
WILDMAN: Yes. <br>
EMH: Well, Ensign, unfortunately, pregnancy causes its fair share of
discomforts, and you'll have to learn to live with them. That's just
the way it is. (to Kes) We'll schedule her for follow-up in two days.
If the pain has not subsided on its own by then, we'll attempt to
decrease the sensitivity of the nerve in that region. <br>
WILDMAN: Thank you, Doctor. <br>
KES: Call me day or night if this gets any worse. <br>
(Wildman leaves.)<br>
KES: Don't you have any compassion for the way she feels? <br>
EMH: Every member of this crew is an adult. I will not coddle them.
Compassion can be your department. Fortunately, you have enough for
both of us. <br>
KES: You've never been sick or in pain. I just wish once in your life
you could know what it's like, how it makes you feel vulnerable and a
little afraid. Then you'd understand. <br>

and Janeway enter.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: I hated every minute of it. My father had dragged me all the
way from our colony near the Cardassian border on this quest of his.
Away from my friends, my home, and here we were in the middle of a
brutal Central American jungle looking for the descendants of the
ancient Rubber People. <br>
JANEWAY: It must have been very important to him. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Believe me, it was. And he was very disappointed that I
didn't share his enthusiasm. He'd been tracking down the origins of our
tribe for years. <br>
(Chakotay calls up two images on a wall monitor.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: The one on the right is the one I found today. <br>
JANEWAY: And now something you saw on that trip years ago shows up
again on a moon's surface almost seventy thousand light years away. I
don't suppose you have any theories that might explain this. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I can give you an official Rubber Tree People theory if you
like. Sky Spirits. <br>
JANEWAY: Sky Spirits? <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's an ancient myth. Sky Spirits from above created the
first Rubber People in their own image and led the way to a sacred land
where the Rubber People would live for eternity. <br>
JANEWAY: You obviously don't put a great deal of faith in this
explanation. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How much faith do you put in Adam and Eve? Hasn't science
proved that all humans developed from a single evolutionary process? <br>
JANEWAY: That's what I was always taught. On the other hand, none of my
teachers ever spent much time in the Delta Quadrant. B'Elanna tells me
we've picked up a warp signature heading away from the moon. Think we
should follow it? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't know that it's fair for me to put my own personal
curiosity ahead of the ship's priorities. <br>
JANEWAY: We still haven't found the polyferranide we need to seal the
warp coils. If these people have warp technology, they might be able to
help us. Besides, we are in the business of exploring, aren't we? <br>
CHAKOTAY: My father would put on his expedition hat and shout, let's
go. I guess that's good enough for me. </font></p>

KIM: Showing no life signs. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Paris, are you certain the warp signature ended here? <br>
PARIS: Positive, Captain. Harry, check your sensors. That look like
some kind of power source to you? <br>
KIM: That is an unusually high EM reading for a natural occurrence. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Could be some kind of cloaking technology. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Kim, transmit a continuous message on all frequencies
identifying who we are, where we're from, and make it clear our
intentions are peaceful. <br>

Acknowledged. We'll send down an away team to continue the survey.
Report to Transporter room three. <br>
TORRES [OC]: On my way. <br>
JANEWAY: Commander, if we meet any resistance, abort the mission. I
have no intention of disturbing an alien race that would rather be left
alone. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Understood. <br>
JANEWAY: On the other hand, if we can make contact, our goal is to get
permission to begin excavation as soon as possible. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok, you're with me. Mister Neelix, please report to
Transporter room three for an away mission. <br>

We may be out of luck. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Problem? <br>
TORRES: I'm not sure we can transport down. Every time we try to lock
onto a transport site, a storm begins. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Storm? <br>
TORRES: We've tried seven different sites and as soon as we lock on, an
electrical storm forms right above the location. When we change sites,
a new storm forms and the old one dissipates. <br>
TUVOK: Might the transporter beam itself be causing an electrostatic
charge in the atmosphere? <br>
TORRES: That's as good a guess as any. I can't explain it. We just
can't transport. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Fine. We'll take a shuttle. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Shuttlecraft]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TUVOK:
Once again, the storm seems to have formed as a direct result of our
interaction with the atmosphere. The meteorological conditions changed
radically when we began our entry sequence. <br>
TORRES: Shields are holding. <br>
NEELIX: It takes more than a little thunderstorm to bother one of your
mighty Starfleet ships, huh? <br>

KOLOPAK: That's why they call it a rain forest. <br>
YOUNG CHAKOTAY: Why do your Sky Spirits choose a place where it rains
all the time? And it's hot, and there are so many bugs. <br>
KOLOPAK: It's said the Sky Spirits honoured the land above all else.
Maybe it's because this land yields so many different kinds of life.
Maybe they wanted us to become friends with everything in nature,
including the bugs. <br>
YOUNG CHAKOTAY: Sorry, Sky Spirits, I will never make friends with
bugs. <br>
KOLOPAK: Maybe that's why they keep biting you. You're miserable. It
was a mistake to bring you. I'm sorry. <br>
YOUNG CHAKOTAY: I'm sorry I can't be what you want me to be. <br>
KOLOPAK: From the day you came out of your mother, upside down, I knew
the Spirits had chosen you to be a contrary. <br>
YOUNG CHAKOTAY: No one chooses for me. I choose my own way. And if that
makes me a contrary, I'll have to live with it. <br>

break the ice, as it were, that I restored it. Let's just say it works
for me. (Sneezes) <br>
KES: Doctor. <br>
EMH: Ah, you noticed. <br>
KES: Are holograms supposed to sneeze? <br>
EMH: Generally, no, but I have accepted your challenge. I've programmed
myself with the symptoms of a twenty nine hour Levodian flu. Thus, I
will gain the experience that you suggest would be beneficial to the
performance of my duties.

Don't offer them to patients. Hmm. Interesting sensation, blowing one's

EMH: Nothing of the sort. I intend it to be an educational experience. <br>
KES: I'm sure you'll learn a lot. <br>

unusual power reading, Commander. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Then I guess we'll have to search for these people the old
fashioned way, with our eyes and ears. <br>
NEELIX: Is something bothering you, Commander? <br>
CHAKOTAY: No. It just reminds me of another jungle that I visited once.
The Central American rain forest on Earth. It's the only other place in
the universe that I've ever seen this flower. <br>
TUVOK: It appears to be a rare variety of Cypripedium, of the Asiatic
genus Paphiopedilum.<br>
NEELIX: I never knew you had such horticultural expertise, Mister
Vulcan. <br>
TUVOK: In fact, I am, or more accurately I was, a breeder of prize
Vulcan orchids. <br>
NEELIX: Then we have something in common. I breed orchids too. Don't
they make the most exquisite salad? A touch of Baldoxic vinegar, pure
heaven. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I hereby designate the two of you the team's botanical
surveyors. Collect a sample of that flower. B'Elanna? <br>
TORRES: It's just what we've been looking for. Almost pure
polyferranide. But there's a problem with crust reactivity. If we can't
solve it before excavation, we might contaminate the entire yield. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Have Ensign Kim run an analysis from the ship. We should be
able to. <br>

are home, eh? <br>
YOUNG CHAKOTAY: I'm leaving the tribe, Father. <br>
KOLOPAK: What? <br>
YOUNG CHAKOTAY: I got to know a lot of the Starfleet officers
patrolling the Cardassian border. I asked Captain Sulu if he would
sponsor me at Starfleet Academy. <br>
KOLOPAK: And he would do such a thing without even discussing it with
me? <br>
YOUNG CHAKOTAY: I told him I had your approval. <br>
KOLOPAK: Ah. <br>
YOUNG CHAKOTAY: I kept him as far away from you as I could. <br>
KOLOPAK: I take it you've been accepted by the Academy? Well, you've
never fully embraced the traditions of our tribe, I know that. And
you've always been curious about other societies, and that is why I
allowed you to read about them. Because I believe that ignorance is our
greatest enemy. But to leave the tribe? <br>
YOUNG CHAKOTAY: Our tribe lives in the past. A past of fantasy and
myth. <br>
KOLOPAK: That past is a part of you, no matter how hard you try to
reject it. <br>
YOUNG CHAKOTAY: Other tribes have learned to accept the twenty fourth
century. Why can't ours? <br>
KOLOPAK: It is not the place of a fifteen year old boy to question the
choices of his tribe. <br>
YOUNG CHAKOTAY: I know. That's why I have to leave. <br>

you will never belong to this one. You'll be caught between worlds. <br>

PARIS: Surface conditions are back to normal, Captain. Winds, two
knots. But I can't find any sign of their shuttle. It's not where they
landed it. <br>
JANEWAY: And it isn't airborne? <br>
PARIS: No, ma'am. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll lead the away team back. Mister Tuvok, Lieutenant, you're
with me. Mister Paris, you have the <br>
EMH [OC]: Captain Janeway, this is the Doctor. Please turn to your
Emergency Medical Holographic channel. <br>
JANEWAY: What is it, Doctor? <br>
(The EMH's voice is almost gone.) <br>
EMH [on monitor]: Something terrible has happened. My programme
(coughs) <br>
JANEWAY: Doctor, I think you're carrying this experiment of yours a
little too far. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: One hour too far to be precise. I very specifically
programmed a twenty nine hour Levodian flu, and it has now been thirty
hours. <br>
JANEWAY: Doctor, I'm sorry but we have more pressing matters to <br>
EMH [on monitor]: You can't leave me like this. I need help. </font></p>

I'm going to need you with me, Kes. Prepare a medkit and bring it with
you to Transporter room three. Commander Chakotay is still on the
surface and may be injured. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY

(Kes gets the EMH to bed.) <br>
EMH: Oh, I don't understand it. I ran a computer diagnostic and it said
my programme was fine. <br>
KES: Just rest, Doctor. <br>
EMH: Oh. <br>
KES: Here's a cool holographic towel for your forehead. <br>
EMH: Thank you. Thank you so much. Please, don't go yet. <br>
KES: I have to. The Captain <br>
EMH: I feel like I'm fading. Just fading away. You don't know what that
means to a hologram. <br>
KIM: What seems to be the problem? <br>
EMH: Oh. My simulated virus is leading me to a simulated death. <br>
KES: It's nothing to worry about. I just added a couple of hours to his
computer programme. He'll be fine in about
forty five minutes. Knowing when it would end didn't exactly make it a
fair test, did it, Doctor? <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TORRES:
I don't understand it. It's the same thing that happened the first time
we tried to go down. A storm develops wherever we try to lock on. <br>
JANEWAY: Why would we have the ability to beam people up, but not beam
them down? <br>
TUVOK: I believe we have seen enough to discern a pattern, Captain. The
logical conclusion is that someone is controlling the elements of
nature to ward us off. The transporter anomaly is evidence of this
conclusion. We are allowed to leave the planet, but not to approach. <br>
JANEWAY: If that's true, I'd be happy to respect their wishes. But
unfortunately, I have a missing crewman to get back first. Janeway to
Paris. </font></p>

Yes, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Mister Paris, we're going to land Voyager on the surface.
Take us into the atmosphere. <br>
PARIS: Acknowledged. Beginning entry sequence. <br>
KIM: I'm reading a electrical storms forming all around us. <br>
PARIS: Adjusting flight path. <br>
KIM: The barometric pressure is continuing to fall. We're looking at
monsoon conditions out there. <br>
(The storm is building on the surface. Chakotay explores and finds a
cave, but lightning strikes are guarding the entrance. He takes a
chance and manages to dodge inside.) <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Paris, the shuttle crew didn't report turbulence this
severe during their landing. <br>
PARIS: I'm doing the best I can, Captain. I'm showing gale force winds
out there. <br>
TUVOK: It is conceivable that the aliens have been able to intensify
their response now that they are familiar with our capabilities. <br>
JANEWAY: Red alert. <br>
PARIS: Inertial dampers are offline. We seem to be caught in some kind
of vortex. I can't maintain altitude. <br>
KIM: Captain, it's a cyclone. <br>
PARIS: Altitude, twenty thousand metres and falling. I can't get us out
of this thing, Captain. <br>

just be stains on the back wall. <br>

can't understand. <br>

his father drew in the soil, and its name.) <br>

ALIEN: Do you understand my words now? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes. <br>
ALIEN: Explain the face marking. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I wear it to honour my father. He wore it to honour his
ancestors. <br>
ALIEN: Ancestors. You are human? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes. <br>
ALIEN: Are there others on your world with this mark? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes. Not many, but some. <br>
ALIEN: We were taught all of them had been annihilated. We were taught
your world had been ravaged by those with no respect for life or land. <br>
CHAKOTAY: There was a time when that was true, but no longer. <br>
ALIEN: He claims to be a descendent of the Inheritors. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Inheritors? <br>
ALIEN: The ones our ancestors chose to honour. I'm surprised you have
no memory of the Inheritors. One of our gifts was the memory. If you
are a descendent, you should remember. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm not sure I understand. <br>
ALIEN: Perhaps it has been lost over time. <br>
(The alien leader puts his hand on Chakotay's chest. Chakotay sees an
image of another alien doing the same to a native in animal skins, in
the Arctic.) <br>
ALIEN: Forty five years ago, on our fist visit to your world, we met a
small group of nomadic hunters. They had no spoken language, no
culture, except the use of fire and stone weapons. But they did have a
respect for the land and for other living creatures that impressed us
deeply. We decided to give them an inheritance, a genetic bonding so
they might thrive and protect your world. On subsequent visits, we
found that our genetic gift brought about a spirit of curiosity and
adventure. It impelled them to migrate away from the cold climate to a
new, unpeopled land. It took them almost a thousand generations to
cross your planet. Hundreds of thousands of them flourished in their
new land. Their civilisation had a profound influence on others of your
species. But then, new people came with weapons and disease. The
Inheritors who survived scattered. Many sought refuge in other
societies. Twelve generations ago, when we returned, we found no sign
of their existence. <br>
CHAKOTAY: My people called you the Sky Spirits. Why have you been
hiding from us since we landed here? <br>
ALIEN: When we heard your message, who you were, observed you probing
our land, we believed you were a threat. We thought you would
annihilate us as you had the Inheritors. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Our message was supposed to communicate peaceful intentions. <br>
ALIEN: We were taught that is the way human conquerors often introduce
themselves. <br>
CHAKOTAY: As I said, we've tried to change our ways since the last time
you stopped by. </font></p>

showing an alien population. I have located the shuttle. It may be
possible to locate Commander Chakotay without landing. <br>

generations to reach your world. <br>

ALIEN: Does he still live? <br>
CHAKOTAY: No. He died fighting enemies who would have taken our home
colony. Our tribe moved there a few hundred years ago. <br>
ALIEN: So he honoured the land just as his ancestors did. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes. Yes, he did. We weren't on very good terms when he died.
Once he was gone, I didn't know how to reconcile our differences, how
to heal our old wounds. I returned to my colony and continued the fight
in his name. I took the mark that he wore to honour his ancestors. I
spoke to him in my vision quests, but he never answered. Until now. <br>
