Captain's log. Using the lightspeed breakaway factor, the Enterprise
has moved back through time to the twentieth century. We are now in
extended orbit around Earth, using our ship's deflector shields to
remain unobserved. Our mission, historical research.
We are monitoring Earth communications to find out how our planet
survived desperate problems in the year 1968.

thousand light years away. <br>
SCOTT: No transporter beam can reach that far, not even in our century.

KIRK: Something is shaking us apart. <br>
SCOTT: It's locked, it's locked our circuits wide open. <br>
(One of the transporter pads has activated.) <br>
KIRK: You're right. Something is beaming aboard. <br>
(It's a man in a dark suit, holding a black cat. He steps down from the
platform and speaks calmly.) <br>
SEVEN: Why have you intercepted me? <br>
KIRK: Security. <br>
SECURITY [OC]: Security. <br>
KIRK: Transporter room, on the double. <br>
SECURITY [OC]: On our way, sir. <br>
SEVEN: Please identify yourselves. <br>
KIRK: This is the United Spaceship Enterprise. I'm Captain Kirk,
commanding. <br>
SEVEN: (to the cat) Yes, I heard him, Isis. We're aboard a space
vessel. From what planet? <br>
KIRK: Earth. <br>
SEVEN: That's impossible. In this time period, there weren't (notices
Spock) Humans with a Vulcan? You're from the future, Captain. You're
going to have to beam me down to Earth immediately. <br>
(Security arrive.) <br>
KIRK: Phasers on stun. <br>
SEVEN: Careful, Isis. All right. Captain Kirk. My name is Gary Seven. I
am a human being from the twentieth century. I was on my way <br>
KIRK: Humans of the twentieth century do not go beaming around the
galaxy, Mister Seven. <br>
SEVEN: I've been living on another planet far more advanced. I was
beaming to Earth when you intercepted me. <br>
KIRK: The location of that planet? <br>
SEVEN: They wish their existence kept secret. Even in your time, it
will remain unknown. <br>
SCOTT: It's impossible to hide a whole planet. <br>
SEVEN: Impossible for you, not for them. Captain Kirk, I am of this
time period. You are not. You interfere with me with what I have to do
there, and you'll change history. You'll destroy the Earth and probably
yourselves, too. <br>
SPOCK: If what he says is true, Captain, every second we delay him
could be dangerous. <br>
KIRK: And if he's lying? <br>
SEVEN: This is the most critical period in Earth's history. The planet
I'm from wants to help Earth survive. <br>
KIRK: What if it turns out you're an invading alien from the future? <br>
SPOCK: A most difficult decision, Captain. <br>
KIRK: I can't beam you down without further proof one way or the other.
Security confinement. <br>
SECURITY: This way, please. <br>
KIRK: Sickbay. <br>
MCCOY [OC]: McCoy here. <br>
(Seven attacks the security men. Spock neck-pinches him but is thrown
off. <br>
MCCOY [OC]: Jim. Jim! Jim. What's going on there? <br>
(Kirk gets a phaser and stuns Seven as he starts to work the
transporter controls.) <br>

security confinement. I want a medical analysis fast. Is he or isn't he
human?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, supplemental. A man in a twentieth
century business suit. What is he? Not even Spock's Vulcan neck pinch
could stop him. Without our phasers, he would have over powered all
five of us. I find it difficult to believe the mysterious Mister Seven
can be human, and yet, suppose he is? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Spock is stroking the cat, who is purring.) <br>
KIRK: What do you make of the cat, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Quite a lovely animal, Captain. I find myself strangely drawn to
it. <br>
KIRK: This is the captain. All science, engineering, and supervisory
personnel, lock into the briefing room. Our next decision can be of
enormous consequence, not only to us but to Earth's entire future.
You've already been given as much information as we have. Please break
in at any time with analysis of that information. Navigation report. <br>
CHEKOV [on monitor]: We have analysed the direction of his beam, sir.
Our star maps show no habitable planets in that area of the galaxy. <br>
SPOCK: He did say his planet was hidden, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Engineering. <br>
SCOTT [on monitor]: Still unable to analyze it, sir. It was so
powerful, it fused most of our recording circuits. Could have brought
him back through great distances, could have brought him back through
time. There's no way for us to know. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, historical report. <br>
SPOCK: Current Earth crises would fill a tape bank, Captain. There will
be an important assassination today, an equally dangerous government
coup in Asia, and, this could be highly critical, the launching of an
orbital nuclear warhead platform by the United States countering a
similar launch by other powers. <br>
KIRK: Weren't orbital nuclear devices one of this era's greatest
problems? <br>
SPOCK: Most definitely. Once the sky was full of orbiting H-bombs, the
slightest mistake could have brought one down by accident,
setting off a nuclear holocaust. </font></p>

the guard from shooting him.) <br>

again behind the shelves of glasses. Seven goes to the window and looks
down onto a street filled with people and traffic.) <br>
SEVEN: You're right, Isis. It is primitive. It's incredible that people
can exist like this. At least we won't have to. Not for long. Computer
on. <br>

Supervisor one nine four. Code name Gary Seven. <br>
COMPUTER: Voice pattern matches, but I have no listing of a Gary Seven
assigned this planet. <br>
SEVEN: Computer, I am a class one supervisor. You are ordered to
override previous instructions and answer my questions. <br>
COMPUTER: I am a Beta Five computer capable of analytical decisions.
Please confirm identity as supervisor by describing nature of agents
and mission here. <br>
SEVEN: Computer, I caution you. I have little love for Beta Five
snobbery. Override. All right. Agents are male and female, descendants
of human ancestors taken from Earth approximately six thousand years
ago. They're the product of generations of training
for this mission. Problem. Earth technology and science have progressed
faster than political and social knowledge. Purpose of mission. To
prevent Earth's civilisation from destroying itself before it can
mature into a peaceful society. <br>
COMPUTER: Incomplete but sufficient. Location of agents unreported for
three days. <br>
SEVEN: Why didn't you say so in the first place? No, don't answer that.
Simply begin search immediately. Recheck all news broadcasts, decode
any government intercepted message <br>

beamed down, Captain. <br>
KIRK: If we beam down, can you compare our position with his control
setting? <br>
SCOTT: Aye. <br>
SPOCK: Following him down is a major risk, Captain. If we ourselves do
anything that changes history <br>
KIRK: I'm aware of that. But I must know if he's lying, and we can't
answer that sitting up here. Have ship's stores prepare the proper
costumes. Stand by to beam us down.
