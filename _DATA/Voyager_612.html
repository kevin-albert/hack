That's one planet that never showed up on the multiple choice exam. <br>
TUVOK: Its gravimetric readings are similar to that of a collapsed
dwarf star. It also resembles a quasar, in that it has a high rate of
rotation, approximately fifty eight revolutions per minute. <br>

CHAKOTAY: That's what we're here for. <br>

The new one is brighter than Tahal, or any of his brothers in the sky. <br>
NATIVE: What does he want from us? <br>
SHAMAN: To answer that, we must learn the nature of this god. We must
understand the reason for his arrival. You were making an offering to
Tahal. <br>
NATIVE: I placed the fire-fruit on his altar. Then the ground shook. I
looked up and the new one was there. <br>
SHAMAN: The fire-fruit. Where is it? <br>(It had fallen onto the ground. The shaman picks it up.)<br>SHAMAN: The new one doesn't want Tahal to
have the fire-fruit. Make an altar for him, as big as Tahal's. The

Report. <br>
TUVOK: We're in synchronous orbit, fifty seven thousand kilometres above
the planet's equator. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Good work, Tom. Now, let's see<br>
PARIS: You're patting the wrong guy on the back. <br>
JANEWAY: Explain. <br>
PARIS: Our thrusters went offline halfway through our descent and then
we just stopped, like we were caught in something. <br>
TUVOK: I'm picking up a strong tachyon field along the hull. It could
be what's holding us. <br>
SEVEN [OC]: Seven of Nine to the bridge. <br>
JANEWAY: Go ahead, Seven. <br>
SEVEN [OC]: Please report to Astrometrics. There's something you must
see. <br>
JANEWAY: On my way. Chakotay.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Astrometrics
lab]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
The planet has a tachyon core. It's produced a subspace particle field
which runs between the poles. Voyager's arrival disrupted that field. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It looks like the ship's been caught in an eddy of some kind.
<br>
JANEWAY: It's worse than that. Voyager seems to have become the
planet's third pole. <br>
SEVEN: The imbalance is affecting the outer crust. I've picked up
indications of high-frequency seismic activity. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Caused by our presence? <br>
SEVEN: Possibly. <br>
JANEWAY: Does anybody live down there? <br>
SEVEN: The atmosphere is having a scattering effect on our sensors. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Is that vegetation? <br>
SEVEN: According to sensors, yes. <br>
JANEWAY: The tachyon core has created a space-time differential between
the planet and the surrounding space. We're watching the seasons change
in a matter of seconds. <br>
SEVEN: For each second that passes on Voyager, nearly a day goes by on
the planet. <br>
JANEWAY: Scan for inhabitants. <br>
SEVEN: I can't isolate individual lifeforms. It'll take time to correct
for the space-time differential <br>
CHAKOTAY: A couple of hundred years, maybe? If our orbit starts to
decay, Voyager will begin to feel the effects of the differential and
we'll begin aging hundreds of times faster than we would in normal
space. <br>
JANEWAY: Unless we want to live our lives in the blink of an eye, I
suggest we find a way out of here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CHAKOTAY:
How's our warp core? <br>
TORRES: The matter-antimatter reaction is still active, but this field
we're stuck in is raising hell with the nacelles. Until we break orbit,
warp drive is offline. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Without warp drive, we'll never leave orbit. <br>
TORRES: It does pose a bit of a problem, doesn't it? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe the key is to learn more about this planet, in case
we're missing something. <br>
TORRES: Sensors aren't having an easy time of it either. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Then let's modify a class-five probe for low orbit, see what
we can pick up. Configure the programme to scan along all subspace
bands, and set it for visual images every ten milliseconds. <br>
TORRES: Snapshots. Why do I get the feeling you're not just interested
in tachyon fields? <br>
CHAKOTAY: This could be the greatest anthropological find of my career.
If there's an intelligent species down there, we'll be able to track
their development, not just for days or weeks, but for centuries. <br>
TORRES: Watch them discover new and better ways of beating each other
over the head. <br>
CHAKOTAY: They won't necessarily follow the Klingon model. <br>
TORRES: As opposed to the Human model? It'll take a few hours to make
the adjustments. <br>
CHAKOTAY: A few hours. We might miss the rise and fall of a
civilisation. <br>
TORRES: So we'll watch the next one. </font></p>

be. <br>
KELEMENE: More heat. <br>(The man inflating the hot air balloon looks up.)<br>KELEMENE: There are grave matters of state here that cannot
be delayed. <br>
CLERIC: Protector, what exactly are you doing? <br>
KELEMENE: I'm sending him a letter. <br>
CLERIC: Him? Sending who a letter? <br>
KELEMENE: The Ground Shaker. The Light Bringer. <br>
CLERIC: Had you been more attentive to my lessons when you were a
boy, you would not be so gullible as a man. <br>
KELEMENE: On the contrary, you taught me well. Our ignorant ancestors
believed every star was a deity. You taught me how foolish that was.
Superstition, you called it. <br>
CLERIC: And that's exactly what it is. <br>
KELEMENE: Hungry? <br>
CLERIC: It's bad fortune to eat the fire-fruit. <br>
KELEMENE: According to whom? Our ancestors? Don't tell me you believe
that old superstition? Perhaps we shouldn't completely ignore the old
beliefs, no matter how strange they may seem today. Ground Shaker.
Ground shaker. Isn't it possible the name was not given arbitrarily?
That this star is indeed responsible for knocking down our walls and
making us stumble as we walk? <br>
CLERIC: Oh yes, I heard about that. My condolences. <br>
KELEMENE: You heard what? <br>
CLERIC: Well, that you stumbled in front of several important people
during the last ground shake. Uh, very embarrassing, I'm sure. <br>
KELEMENE: I did nothing of the sort. <br>
CLERIC: Well, my hearing is not as good as it used to be, nor my
memory either. Now, what were we talking about? <br>
KELEMENE: We were talking about ancient superstitions. Now, I don't
believe for a moment that the stars are gods, but then, what are they? <br>
CLERIC: A great mystery to which there is no answer. <br>
KELEMENE: I believe the sky is full of people just like ourselves. <br>
CLERIC: What? Oh, nonsense. <br>
KELEMENE: Prove me wrong. I say each star encompasses a city and the
Ground Shaker rules one of these cities. A fellow Protector. If I'm
correct, then he'll listen to me, one Protector to another. Your pen.
<br>(The cleric takes a quill and paper out of his wooden case and sets it up to write on.)<br>KELEMENE: I, Kelemane. <br>
CLERIC: Kelemane. <br>
KELEMENE: Son of Kelemane, ruler of the good people of the land below
you, demand that you stop what you're <br>
CLERIC: Demand? <br>
KELEMENE: Would hope? <br>
CLERIC: Ah, better. Much better. <br>
KELEMENE: Would hope that you might consider putting an end to whatever
it is you're doing that shakes our ground. If this causes you
inconvenience I'm willing to offer a recompense. <br>
CLERIC: A recompense. <br>
KELEMENE: I await your reply.<br>(The

The next series of scans is coming through. I'm downloading them into
the display buffer. <br>
CHAKOTAY: No doubt about it. There's a city down there. <br>
TORRES: Elevated levels of carbon monoxide, ammonium. That's progress,
all right. <br>
CHAKOTAY: They've developed internal combustion technology since the
last few scans. Look at those radial lines. It looks like a system of
roads. <br>
TORRES: Well, one thing hasn't changed. The geological disturbances
that Voyager seems to be causing. The probe recorded half a dozen each
month. Still no way to tell how severe they are. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Look at the amount of iron being used in that city. That's
ten times what you'd expect to see in a culture at this stage of
development. <br>
TORRES: Do you think they're using it to support their buildings? <br>
CHAKOTAY: If you lived on a planet that wouldn't stop shaking, you
might be doing the same thing. If they've reached this stage of
industrial development, they must be observing us. <br>
TORRES: The probe's impulse thrusters are starting to fail. At its
present altitude, it's been operating for over two hundred years. Its
orbit is becoming decayed. <br>

TECHNICIAN: Actually, I had them all, even the duplicates. You couldn't
walk into my home without tripping over a Friend or two. <br>
ASTRONOMER: Not in our home. My grandfather wouldn't allow it. He told
us that the Sky Ship was a palace where an Evil Protector lived. He
said that bad children were sent there to be punished. At this point,
I'd be happy to see anything, evil or not. Can you boost the signal? <br>

[OC]: There's nothing on our world that resembles your technology, so
we assume you came here from a nearby planet or a distant star. Our
ancient mythology describes your arrival centuries ago, coinciding with
the tremors that continually shake our planet and destroy so many of
our accomplishments. I hope that was never your intention, but the
result is the same. Respond if you can. Or if you wish, come down from
your Sky Ship and visit us. <br>
PARIS: Well, we've got to let them know we're not doing it on purpose. <br>
TUVOK: Inadvisable. The Prime Directive still applies. This
transmission was made with primitive radio technology. They are not a
warp capable civilisation. <br>
PARIS: To hell with the Prime Directive. That man deserves an answer. <br>
TORRES: Don't forget the temporal differential. That man has been dead
for a long time. <br>EMH: Nearly a century by now. <br>
PARIS: Okay, so we send a message to his great grandchildren. I'll
gladly do the honours. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Ancient mythology. That means we've already insinuated
ourselves into their culture. Why not take the next step? <br>
JANEWAY: First contact with a pre-warp society. <br>
PARIS: We've already made first contact. They know we're up here. <br>
JANEWAY: They've known for hundreds of years, which means our presence
has been tempered by time. We've gradually become part of their mythos.
Meeting us could throw that belief system into chaos. <br>
PARIS: But we're destroying their planet. You heard him. <br>
CHAKOTAY: A first contact, face to face, might give us information we
could use to leave orbit. That would stop the damage. It's worth the
risk. <br>
JANEWAY: We don't even know if an away team could survive the
transition to their time frame. Doctor, correct me if I'm wrong, but the
physiological stress could be fatal. <br>

EMH: They're hardly savages, Captain. In fact, they're making great
strides technologically, thanks in part to Voyager. <br>

EMH: From the moment our ship arrived in the sky, they've been trying to
make contact. Our presence has encouraged invention, religion, science,
art even children's toys. They're all variations on a single theme,

That's my intention. I saw something that looks like a transfer port.
It might be a place we can dock. Move in closer. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Jefferies

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TRINA:
Wait, wait. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Are you all right? <br>
TRINA: A little disoriented. Let's keep going. </font></p>

I don't understand. <br>
TRINA: Her skin feels warm. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TRINA:
It might be some sort of metabolic stasis. But then why does it look
like they're just going about their business? <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: This isn't right. We shouldn't be here. We were never
meant to be here. <br>
TRINA: Try and stay calm. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: We've seen enough. Please, we have to leave. <br>
TRINA: You're the best pilot we have. That's why you're on this
mission. This is no different than flying your favourite <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Oh, it's different. <br>
TRINA: I can't argue with that. Another few minutes, then we'll go
back. This looks like their command centre. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Neelix is pouring coffee into Janeway's cup.)<br>GOTANA-RETZ:
This is not metabolic stasis. <br>
TRINA: Could the laws of physics be different here? <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Maybe they're just a little slower. <br>(Trina grabs her abdomen in pain.)<br>GOTATA-RETZ: What's wrong? <br>(The both
collapse on
floor. We return to normal time.) <br>
TUVOK: Intruder Alert. Security team to deck one. <br>
KIM: Captain, I'm picking up a ship at docking port one. It just
appeared there. <br>
JANEWAY: Bridge to Sickbay. Medical emergency. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
What can you tell me. <br>
EMH: The transition to our time frame was a little rough for them. I'm
afraid his colleague didn't make it. <br>
JANEWAY: How is he? <br>
EMH: Recovering. Lucky for him I'm as good as his family doctor. After
three years of poring over their medical journals, I know as much about
their physiology as I do yours. Easy. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Where's Trina? <br>
JANEWAY: She didn't survive the transition. I'm very sorry. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Transition? To your time frame? <br>
JANEWAY: You understand what's happened to you? <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: I'm beginning to. <br>
JANEWAY: Voyager exists in the same space-time as the rest of the
galaxy. Your planet is different. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: So you really haven't been watching us for centuries. <br>
JANEWAY: Actually, we just got here, And we're hoping you can help us
find a way to leave. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Ready
room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">GOTANA-RETZ:
So if what you're saying is true, everyone I know, everyone I knew, is
gone. <br>
JANEWAY: That's correct. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Captain, I'm an accomplished pilot. That's why they chose
me for this mission. I don't have the courage of the others. They made
a mistake choosing me. <br>
JANEWAY: I have to disagree. For someone whose life has just been
turned upside down, I think you're doing fine. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: When I was a young child, the toys hanging above my crib
depicted the Sky Ship. It's the first thing I ever remember seeing,
even before my mother's face. And now I'm the only one that knows its
name. Voyager. I suppose it'll be the last thing I see as well. <br>
JANEWAY: that's up to you. I have no intention of keeping you here
against your will. The Doctor spent some time on your planet collecting
data that we hoped would help us find a way to leave orbit. We need you
to assist us in interpreting that information. However, the longer you
stay on board, the more difficult it will be for you to go home. Your
culture is changing every second you're here. By the time you go back,
you might find it more alien than ours. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: (sings) Star of the night, Star of the day, Come to take
my tears away. Make my life always bright. It's a child's prayer. <br>
JANEWAY: To Voyager? <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Yes. <br>
JANEWAY: I hope you're not disappointed. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: How often does your very first dream come true? Of course
I'll help you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: The
information I brought back is in Voyager's database. Seven of Nine has
been trying to make sense of it. She'll welcome your assistance. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Mountain or Lakeside? <br>
EMH: Mountain, of course. Don't tell me you're a Lakeside supporter. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: You really were on the surface. <br>
EMH: How are they doing this season? <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Not good. Five wins, twelve losses. <br>
EMH: I don't believe it! Who's guarding for them? <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Torelius. <br>
EMH: Any relation to the Torelius? <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: His grandson. <br>
EMH: I saw the original defend for Mountain in the playoffs against Red
River. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: That was before I was born. <br>
EMH: He would have gone into voluntary exile after a 5-12 season. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">GOTANA-RETZ:
This information is out of date. We were far more advanced than this
when I left. I can help you correct it. <br>
SEVEN: Very well. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Let's start with the geological data. The seismic
detectors back then were off by a variance of three point eight. <br>
SEVEN: A simple conversion will compensate for that. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Does every planet look like ours? <br>
SEVEN: None that I've seen. Your world appears to be unique. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: If we're so out of step with everything else, we'll never
be able to explore space the way you have. <br>
SEVEN: You're a highly adaptable species. Your scientists will find a
way to compensate for the temporal differential. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: They'd better do it before you leave. Without the Sky Ship
up above them, my people might lose interest in progress. There
wouldn't be anything left to reach for. <br>
SEVEN: Perhaps they'll miss Voyager so much, they'll do everything they
can to follow us. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Maybe so. What was that? <br>
SEVEN: An antimatter implosion. Your world is experimenting with warp
technology. The sensors detected an early test. Another test, six weeks
later, and a third. More controlled each time. They're learning
quickly. (Whumph.) Too quickly. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
What was that? <br>
TUVOK: Unknown, but our shields are down to eighty two percent. Sixty
four percent. <br>
KIM: I don't know what's causing it. There's nothing on sensors. <br>
JANEWAY: Janeway to Seven of Nine. <br>
SEVEN [OC]: Go ahead, Captain. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN
[OC]: I believe we're under attack. <br>
TUVOK: Another direct hit. Shields at forty nine percent. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Captain, I apologise for this attack. They have no right. <br>
JANEWAY: Unfortunately, they've got every right. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Let me talk to them. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We've already tried to hail them. It doesn't look like
they're able to receive our transmissions. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: They still don't know about the time differential. <br>
TUVOK: A logical assumption. Shields down to thirty four percent. <br>
KIM: The torpedoes are being fired at three day intervals. They're
making refinements each time, increasing the detonation yield. <br>
PARIS: Captain, isn't it time we returned fire? <br>
CHAKOTAY: We've done enough damage to these people over the last
thousand years. <br>
JANEWAY: You've got to go back. It's the only way. Make them understand
who we are. You have the specifications of this ship. Your scientists
might be able to use them to help free us. At the very least, get them
to hold their fire. <br>
KIM: Captain, the transporters are offline. <br>
JANEWAY: Is his vessel still intact? <br>
KIM: The docking port hasn't been hit yet. <br>

GOTANA-RETZ: Thank you for everything, Doctor. <br>
EMH: It was a pleasure to treat a fellow citizen. Would you do me a
favour? <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Certainly. <br>
EMH: Find out what happened to a boy named Jason Tabreez. He lived in
the Central Protectorate. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Jason? An unusual name. <br>
EMH: Yes. He was my son. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: But you're a hologram. <br>
EMH: It's a long story. He's dead by now, but perhaps you could
discover what happened to him. Maybe he had children or grandchildren.
You could tell them about me. <br>

respond. <br>

GOTANA-RETZ: Pilot First Rank, Gotana-Retz. <br>
WEATHER COORDINATOR [OC]: Clear the channel or I'm going to report you
to the command centre. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Is this Launch Control? <br>
WEATHER COORDINATOR [OC]: I'm the weather coordinator for Station zero
zero four. You're in violation of transmission regulations. <br>

WEATHER COORDINATOR [OC]: Let me guess. You finally decided to come
home. You're Gotana-Retz? <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Gotana-Retz, yes. Now, please transfer me to Launch
Control. <br>
WEATHER COORDINATOR [OC]: Launch Control became the Tactical Command
Centre fifty years ago. You're dead. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: I've been inside the Sky Ship. <br>
WEATHER COORDINATOR [OC]: Then it's a good thing you decided to leave.
They're about to shoot it down. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: I've got to speak with them. <br>
WEATHER COORDINATOR [OC]: Tactical Command frequencies are classified.
Now get off this channel. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: If you ever wanted to report more than the weather, now is
your chance. Tell them to clear Central Lake of all traffic. Orbital
One is coming in for a landing. </font></p>

Shields at twenty three percent. Seventeen percent. Shields are down. <br>
PARIS: What was that last one? <br>
KIM: A tricobalt device. <br>
PARIS: What will they think of next? <br>
TUVOK: Damage reports coming in. Imminent hull breeches on decks eight,
nine and ten. Life support is failing. <br>
JANEWAY: Our astronaut should have made it by now. <br>
KIM: Based on his descent velocity, he landed about ten minutes ago. <br>

free. <br>
JANEWAY: No. Let's give our friends the benefit of the doubt. <br>
KIM: They're pulling us away from the planet. <br>
TUVOK: We've broken orbit. <br>
JANEWAY: Try hailing them. <br>(A figure solidifies.)<br>
GOTANA-RETZ: It's good to see you all again. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Looks like somebody down there listened to you. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: I'm sorry it took so long. <br>
JANEWAY: Now we can make first contact the proper way. <br>
GOTANA-RETZ: Unfortunately that won't be possible. A temporal
compensator. It allows me to exist in your time frame without actually
leaving my own, but only for a few minutes. I'm afraid it'll be a while
before my people actually join the rest of the galaxy. <br>
TUVOK: Captain, we'll be able to bring the warp drive back online in
approximately two hours. <br>
