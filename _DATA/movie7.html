<font face="Arial" size="2">JOURNALIST #3: Captain Kirk, how does it
feel to be back on the Enterprise Bridge? ...Can I ask you a few
questions? ...We'd like to know how you feel how you're going...<br>
HARRIMAN: Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. There will be plenty of time
for questions later. I'm Captain John Harriman and I'd like to welcome
you all aboard.<br>
KIRK: It's our pleasure.<br>
HARRIMAN: I just want you to know how excited we all are to have a
group of living legends with us on our maiden voyage. ...I remember
reading about your missions when I was in grade school.<br>
KIRK: Oh, really. Well, ...may we have a look around?<br>
HARRIMAN: Please, ...please.<br>
CHEKOV: Demora!<br>
JOURNALIST #1: Captain, ...this is the first Starship Enterprise in
thirty years without James T. Kirk in command. How do you feel about
that, sir?<br>
KIRK: Oh just fine. I'm glad to be here to send her on her way.<br>
JOURNALIST #3: And what have you been doing since you retired?<br>
KIRK: Keeping busy.<br>
JOURNALIST #3: Captain Kirk...<br>
HARRIMAN (OC): Why don't we give the Captain a chance to look around?<br>
(Kirk takes a longing glance at the Captain's chair)<br>
CHEKOV: Captain. ... Excuse me. ...I'd like you to meet the helmsman of the Enterprise-B. Demora. ...Ensign Demora Sulu.<br>
DEMORA: It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. My father's told me some ...interesting stories about you.<br>
KIRK: Your father is Hikaru Sulu?<br>
DEMORA: Yes sir.<br>
CHEKOV: Oh, you've met her before, when she was...<br>
KIRK: It wasn't so long ago. ...It couldn't have been more than....<br>
CHEKOV: Twelve years, sir.<br>
KIRK: Twelve years?<br>
CHEKOV: Absolutely.<br>
KIRK: Incredible. Congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm.<br>
DEMORA: Thank you, sir.<br> 
CHEKOV: I'm sure Hikaru must be very proud of you.<br>
DEMORA (OC): I hope so.<br>
CHEKOV: I was never that young.<br>
KIRK: No, ...you were younger!<br>
SCOTT: Damn fine ship if you ask me.<br>
KIRK: Scotty, ...it absolutely amazes me.<br>
SCOTT: What would that be, sir?<br>
KIRK: Sulu. When did he find the time to have family?<br>
SCOTT: Well like you always say, if something's important, you'll make the time.<br>
(Kirk takes a second glance at the Captain's chair)<br>
SCOTT: Ah, so that's why you seem so restless. Finding retirement a little lonely, are we?<br>
KIRK: You know, I'm glad you're an engineer. With a tact like that you'd make a lousy psychiatrist.<br>
SCOTT: Ha, ha, ha...<br>
HARRIMAN: Excuse me, gentlemen, ...if you'll take your seats.<br>
KIRK: Yes, of course.<br>
(Kirk gives the Captain's chair a nostalgic pat as he moves away)<br>
HARRIMAN: Prepare to leave Spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one-quarter,
port and starboard at station keeping. ...Captain Kirk, I'd be honoured
if you'd give the order to get underway.<br>
KIRK: Thank you very much. I...<br>
HARRIMAN: Please, sir.<br>
KIRK: No.<br>
HARRIMAN: Please, I insist.<br>
KIRK: Take us out.<br>
(the crew breaks out into general applause)<br>
CHEKOV: Very good, sir.<br>
SCOTT: Brought a tear to my eye.<br>
KIRK: Oh, be quiet.<br>
(as Kirk, Scott and Chekov return from their tour of the ship the journalists accost them again)<br>
JOURNALIST #1: Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Tell me. Now that you've seen the rest of the ship, How's it feel to be back?<br>
KIRK/SCOTT/CHEKOV: Fine. Fine. Fine.<br>
HARRIMAN: Ladies and gentlemen, we've just cleared the asteroid belt.
Our course today will take us out past Pluto and then back to
Spacedock. Just a quick run around the block.<br>
CONN OFFICER: Captain, will there be time to conduct any tests on the warp drive system?<br>
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER: We're picking up a distress call, Captain.<br>
HARRIMAN: On... On speakers.<br>
COMM VOICE: This is the transport ship Lakul. We're caught in some kind
of energy distortion. Two ships in our convoy. ...We're trapped in a
severe gravimetric distortion. We can't break free. We need immediate
help. It' tearing us apart. This is the trans...<br>
SCIENCE OFFICER: The Lakul is one of two ships transporting El-Aurian refugees to Earth.<br>
HARRIMAN: Ensign Sulu, can you locate them?<br>
DEMORA: The ships are bearing at three one zero mark two one five. Distance, three light years.<br>
HARRIMAN: Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. ...We don't even have a full crew aboard.<br>
NAVIGATOR: We're the only one in range, sir.<br>
HARRIMAN: ...Well, then, ...I guess it's up to us. Helm, lay in an intercept course and engage at maximum warp.<br>
DEMORA (OC): Aye sir.<br>
SCOTT: (to Kirk) Captain, is there something wrong with your chair?<br>
DEMORA: We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.<br>
HARRIMAN: On screen.<br>
CHEKOV (OC): What the hell is that?<br>
DEMORA: I've located the transport ships. ...Their hulls are starting
to buckle under the stress. ...They won't survive much longer.<br>
LIEUTENANT: We're encountering severe gravimetric distortions from the energy ribbon, Captain.<br>
HARRIMAN: We'll have to keep our distance. We don't want to get pulled in too.<br>
KIRK: Tractor beam! Tractor beam.<br>
HARRIMAN: We don't have a tractor beam.<br>
KIRK: You left Spacedock without a tractor beam?<br>
HARRIMAN: It won't be installed until Tuesday. ...Ensign Sulu, try
generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them
free.<br>
DEMORA: There's too much quantum interference, Captain.<br>
HARRIMAN: What about... What about venting plasma from the warp nacelles? That might disrupt the ribbon's hold on the ships.<br>
NAVIGATOR: Aye sir. ...Releasing drive-plasma. ...It's not having any effect, sir. I think the ribbon's hold...<br>
DEMORA: Sir! The starboard vessel's hull is collapsing...<br>
CHEKOV (OC): How many people were aboard that ship?<br>
DEMORA (OC): Two hundred sixty-five.<br>
SCIENCE OFFICER: Sir, the Lakul's hull integrity is down to twelve percent.<br>
HARRIMAN: Captain Kirk, ...I would appreciate any suggestions you might have.<br>
KIRK: First ...move us within transporter range and beam those people aboard the Enterprise.<br>
HARRIMAN: What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.<br>
KIRK: Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.<br>
HARRIMAN: Helm, close to within transporter range.<br>
KIRK: And second, ...turn that damned thing off.<br>
(the cameraman turns off the floodlight)<br>
DEMORA: We're within range, sir.<br>
HARRIMAN: Beam them directly to Sickbay.<br>
LIEUTENANT (OC): Aye sir.<br>
CHEKOV: How big is your medical staff?<br>
HARRIMAN: The medical staff ...doesn't arrive 'til Tuesday.<br>
CHEKOV: (mutters in Russian)&nbsp;(to journalists) You and you and you. You've just become nurses. Let's go.<br>
DEMORA: Main engineering reports fluctuations in the warp plasma relays.<br>
LIEUTENANT: Sir, I'm having trouble locking onto them. They appear to be ...in some sort of temporal flux.<br>
KIRK (OC): Scotty?<br>
SCOTT (OC): What the hell.<br>
SCOTT: Their life signs are ...are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.<br>
KIRK: Phasing? To where?<br>
NAVIGATOR: Sir! Their hull's collapsing!<br>
KIRK (OC): Beam them out of there, Scotty!<br>
SCOTT: Transport complete. ...I got forty-seven ...out of one hundred fifty.<br>

this sector. ...Gamma emissions have increased by point zero five
percent. The Starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction.
...Ambient magnetic fields...<br>

said when the Amargosa star was destroyed, it affected the

PICARD: This isn't right. ...This can't be real.<br>
GUINAN (OC): It's as real as you want it to be.<br>
PICARD: Guinan! ...What's going on? ...Why am I here?<br>
GUINAN: You're in the Nexus.<br>
PICARD: This is the Nexus?<br>
GUINAN: For you. This is what you wanted.<br>
PICARD: But ...I never had a home like this. ...Nor a wife and
children. ...But these are all mine. ...Guinan, what are you doing
here? ...I thought you were on board the Enterprise.<br>
GUINAN: I am. ...I'm also here. ...Think of me as an echo of the person you know. ...A part of herself she left behind.<br>
PICARD: When the Enterprise-B beamed you up from the Lakul?<br>
THOMAS PICARD: Papa, help me build my castle.<br>
PICARD: Yes I will, in a few minutes.<br>
MIMI PICARD: Papa, thank you for the dolly. She's very beautiful.<br>

least it used to be, I sold it years ago.<br>

KIRK: The clock, ...I gave this clock to Bones.<br>
PICARD: I'm from what you would consider the future, ...the twenty-fourth century.<br>
(a dog barks in the doorway)<br>
KIRK: Butler! ...Butler, how can you be here? ...He's been dead seven years.<br>
ANTONIA (OC): Come on, Jim, I'm starving. How long have you been rattling around in that kitchen?<br>
KIRK: Antonia! ...What are you talking about? ...The future? This is the past. ...This is nine years ago.<br>

KIRK: ...The day I told her I was going back to Starfleet.<br>
KIRK: These are Ktarian eggs, ...It was her favourite. I was preparing them to soften the blow.<br>
PICARD: I know how real this must seem to you, but it's not. This isn't
really your house. We're both of us caught up in some kind of temporal
nexus.<br>

PICARD: I beg your pardon?<br>
KIRK: Dill weed. ...In the cabinet, second shelf to the left, ...behind the oregano.<br>

(Kirk thrusts a hot frying pan into Picard's hands)<br>
PICARD: Ow!<br>
KIRK: The bulkhead in front of me disappeared. ...Then I found myself
out here just now chopping wood, ...right before you walked up. Thanks.<br>
PICARD: Look, ...history records that you died saving the Enterprise-B from an energy ribbon eighty years ago.<br>
KIRK: You say this is the twenty-fourth century.<br>
Picard: Aha.<br>
KIRK: And I'm dead?<br>
PICARD: Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of...<br>
KIRK/PICARD: Temporal nexus.<br>
KIRK: ...Yeah, I heard you. ...Something is missing.<br>
(the 'missing' two slices of toast pop up from the toaster)<br>
PICARD: Captain, look! I need your help. I want you to leave the Nexus
with me. ...We have to go back to a planet, Veridian Three. ...We have
to stop a man called Soran from destroying a star. Millions of lives
are at stake.<br>
KIRK: You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?<br>
PICARD: You are a Starfleet Officer. You have a duty...<br>
KIRK: I don't need you to lecture me. I was out saving the galaxy when
your grandfather was in diapers. Besides which, I think the galaxy owes
me one. All right, ...I was like you once ...so completely blinded by
duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform.
And in the end, what did it get me? An empty house. ...Not this time.<br>
(Kirk purposefully climbs the stairs)<br>
KIRK: This time I'm going to walk up these stairs, march into that
bedroom ...and tell Antonia that I want to marry her. ...This time it's
going to be different.<br>

ride eleven years ago ...on a spring day, ...like this. If I'm right,
this is the day I met Antonia. ...This Nexus of yours is very clever. I
can start all over again ...and do things right from day one.<br>

(Kirk sees a woman on a horse on a distant hill)<br>
PICARD (OC): Antonia?<br>
KIRK: She isn't real either, is she? Nothing here is. ...Nothing here matters.<br>
KIRK: You know, maybe this is less about an empty house than that empty
chair on the bridge of the Enterprise. Ever since I left Starfleet I
haven't made a difference. ...Captain of the Enterprise, huh?<br>
PICARD: That's right.<br>
KIRK: Close to retirement?<br>
PICARD: I'm not planning on it.<br>
KIRK: Let me tell you something. Don't! Don't let them promote you.
Don't let them transfer you. Don't let them do anything that takes you
off the bridge of that ship, because while you're there, you can make a
difference.<br>
PICARD: Come back with me. Help me stop Soran. Make a difference again.<br>
KIRK: Who am I to argue with the Captain of the Enterprise? ...What's the name of that planet, ...Veridian Three?<br>
PICARD: Yes.<br>
KIRK: I take it the odds are against us, and the situation is grim?<br>
PICARD: You could say that.<br>

launcher and then accidentally drops it. It lands onto the scaffolding
bridge)<br>

decloaks the rocket launcher before the bridge breaks away and plunges
downward with him on it)<br>
