from Alture Seven. Listen to this. First they bath you in a protein
bath. Then a cloud of chromal vapour carries you into a meditation
chamber. You should try it. <br>

management with ten Bajoran bureaucrats. And they won't be carrying me

You must have a fascinating perspective into biocybernetic research.
I'd be delighted if we could discuss the subject sometime. <br>

experiment. <br>
BASHIR: Ah, yes. I realise I should have asked before using your
sickbay, but it would've taken me days to analyse this device with the
computer I have on Deep Space Nine. <br>
DATA: What type of device is this? <br>
BASHIR: It was discovered in the Gamma Quadrant. I think it must be
some sort of medical instrument. <br>
DATA: It appears to employ plasma inputs. <br>
BASHIR: I'm hoping it's a medical scanner. I wanted to use your
computer to find out how it works. <br>

TROI: My god. Could it be true? <br>
WORF: A Klingon would never allow himself to be captured. A warrior
fights to the death. If my father were alive it would dishonour his
sons and their sons for three generations. Even Alexander would bear
the burden of guilt. <br>
TROI: So, you're willing to ignore the possibility because you're
concerned about dishonour? <br>

from the dilithium chamber into the plasma inputs, it should be
sufficient to activate the device. <br>
LAFORGE: It's worth a try. You two can begin by connecting the coil to
the chamber. I'll configure the energy transfer. <br>
BASHIR: Right. Data, can I ask you a personal question? <br>
DATA: Certainly. <br>
BASHIR: Does your hair grow? <br>
DATA: I can control the rate of my follicle replenishment. However, I
have not yet had a reason to modify the length of my hair. Why do you
ask? <br>
BASHIR: Just curious. <br>
DATA: Power conduits are ready. Is something wrong, Doctor? <br>
BASHIR: You're breathing. <br>
DATA: Yes. I do have a functional respiration system. However, its
purpose is to maintain thermal control of my internal systems. I am, in
fact, capable of functioning for extended periods in a vacuum. <br>
BASHIR: And you have a pulse. <br>
DATA: My circulatory system not only produces bio-chemical lubricants,
it regulates micro-hydraulic power. Most people are interested in my
extraordinary abilities. How fast I can compute, my memory capacity,
how long I will live. No one has ever asked me if my hair will grow, or
noticed that I can breathe. <br>
BASHIR: Your creator went to a lot of trouble to make you seem human. I
find that fascinating. <br>
LAFORGE: Okay, I think we're ready to begin the transfer. <br>
DATA: Power connections are complete. <br>
BASHIR: I'll monitor the coil's transfer rate. Will you keep an eye on
the transient power response? <br>
DATA: Of course. We are ready, Geordi. <br>

(an orange light appears between the two sections of the device)<br>
BASHIR: Power levels are holding steady. <br>
DATA: Transient response is normal. <br>

rate. <br>
LAFORGE: Reducing rate by twenty percent. <br>

BASHIR: Data, are you all right? <br>
DATA: I believe so. What has happened? <br>
LAFORGE: A plasma shock overloaded your positronic net. You were down a
good thirty seconds. <br>
DATA: That cannot be possible. I have a memory record for that period
of time. I can recall a series of images. I saw Doctor Soong. My
father. <br>
(after the adverts, tests are continuing) <br>
LAFORGE: Data, I can't find anything wrong with your positronic
subprocessors or your circuit controllers. No sign of any residual
energy fluctuation, cascade overload. <br>
DATA: My internal diagnostic indicates that my memory systems are
functioning within normal parameters. For the forty seven seconds that
I was inactive, there is no record of cognitive activity. <br>
LAFORGE: There's no doubt about it, Data. You were completely shut
down. Maybe you had some kind of random power fluctuation, caused you
to access one of your memory files. <br>
DATA: That cannot be. The image I saw was of Doctor Soong as a young
man. I did not encounter him until much later in his life. There
appears to be no rational explanation for my experience. <br>
LAFORGE: I'll take another look at the diagnostic log. In the meantime,
you'd better disconnect that device. <br>
BASHIR: Data, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way. <br>
DATA: How so? <br>
BASHIR: Well, maybe you had a dream or a hallucination. <br>
DATA: I am not capable of either of those functions. <br>
BASHIR: Yet you can't account for what happened today, can you? <br>
DATA: At present, I cannot. <br>
BASHIR: Well maybe you should approach this from a more human
standpoint. You're right that machines can't have hallucinations, but

nature. Do you have a moment? <br>
WORF: A moment. <br>
DATA: I have heard you mention that you once experienced a vision. <br>
WORF: Yes. When I was young my adoptive parents arranged for me to
partake in the Rite of MajQa. <br>
DATA: I understand it involves deep meditation in the lava caves of
No'Mat. That prolonged exposure to the heat induces a hallucinatory
effect. <br>
WORF: Why are you asking me about this? <br>
DATA: I have recently had an unusual experience, which might be
described as a vision. <br>
WORF: What happened? <br>
DATA: An accident in Engineering shut down my cognitive functions for a
short period of time, yet I seemed to remain conscious. I saw my
father. <br>
WORF: You are very fortunate. That is a powerful vision. <br>
DATA: If it was a vision, I do not know how to proceed. <br>
WORF: You must find its meaning. If it has anything to do with your
father, you must learn all you can about it. In the Klingon MajQa
ritual, there is nothing more important than receiving a revelation
about your father. Your father is part of you, always. Learning about
him teaches you about yourself. That is why no matter where he is or
what he has done, you must find him. <br>
DATA: But I am not looking for my father. <br>
WORF: Yes, of course. Do not stop until you have the answer. <br>

PICARD: Yes, Mister Data? <br>
DATA: I am sorry to disturb you, sir. <br>
PICARD: Not at all. I'm here studying the intricacies of Bajoran
aqueduct management. I would welcome an interruption. Please, sit down.
<br>
DATA: I require your advice. I have come to an impasse regarding my
recent unexplained experience. <br>
PICARD: Your vision of Doctor Soong. How is your investigation
proceeding? <br>
DATA: I have analysed over four thousand different religious and
philosophical systems, as well as over two hundred psychological
schools of thought, in an effort to understand what happened. <br>
PICARD: And what have you found? <br>
DATA: I have been unable to find a single interpretation of the images
I saw during the time I was shut down. The hammer, for instance, has
several meanings. The Klingon culture views the hammer as a symbol of
power. However, the Taqua tribe of Nagor sees it as an icon of hearth
and home. The Ferengis view it as a sign of sexual prowess. <br>
PICARD: I'm curious, Mister Data. Why are you looking at all these
other cultures? <br>
DATA: The interpretation of visions and other metaphysical experiences
are almost always culturally derived, and I have no culture of my own. <br>
PICARD: Yes, you do. You're a culture of one, which is no less valid
than a culture of one billion. Perhaps the key to understanding your
experience is to stop looking into other sources for a meaning. When we
look at Michaelangelo's David or Symnay's Tomb and we don't ask what
does this mean to other people. The real question is, what does it mean
to us? Explore this image, Data. Let it excite your imagination. Focus
on it. See where it leads you. Let it inspire you. <br>

should paint smoke. <br>

DATA: I cannot explain it. It is not an image I saw during my vision. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, you have the smoke coming out of a bucket of water.
Blacksmiths used to use water to cool the metal. Maybe that's why you
painted it. <br>
DATA: Perhaps. After I painted the smoke, it then occurred to me to
paint a bird's wing. I then drew an entire bird. A flock of birds
flying in formation. An individual feather. If the image of a bird is
related to my vision, I do not understand how. I am left with more of a
mystery than ever. Geordi, I would like to recreate the experiment

DATA: What type of journey? <br>
(Data is lying on a bed) <br>
SOONG: Think of it, think of it as an empty sky. <br>
DATA: I do not understand. <br>
SOONG: Shh. Just dream, Data. Dream. Data, you are the bird. <br>
(and he flies along the corridor, past Soong and out into the wonders
of space before waking up again in Engineering) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: The images I saw during the time I was shut
down were generated by a series of previously dormant circuits in my
neural net. I believe Doctor Soong incorporated those circuits into my
base programming, intending to activate them when I reached a certain
level of development. <br>
BASHIR: But the plasma shock activated them prematurely. <br>
DATA: That is correct. <br>
BASHIR: I'm curious. Now that those circuits are active, what are you
going to do with them? <br>
DATA: I plan to shut down my cognitive functions for a brief period
each day. I hope to generate new internal visions. <br>
BASHIR: It sounds to me like you're talking about dreaming. <br>
DATA: An accurate analogy. <br>
BASHIR: Remarkable. You know, this is just the kind of thing that might
get me published in the Starfleet Cybernetics Journal. Would you mind
if I authored a paper on all this? <br>
DATA: Of course not. <br>
BASHIR: Thank you, Data. And sweet dreams. <br>

singing to a table by a fire) <br>

(Worf follows an old man inside and grabs him) <br>
WORF: Quiet! I'm a friend. <br>
L'KOR: Who? Who are you? <br>
WORF: Worf, son of Mogh. <br>
L'KOR: Why have you come here? <br>
WORF: I have come to find my father. Is he alive? Is he here? <br>
L'KOR: Your father fell at Khitomer. <br>
WORF: Did he die in battle? <br>
L'KOR: He was fortunate. <br>
WORF: You were captured. <br>
L'KOR: Yes. <br>
WORF: Romulans. They robbed you of your right to die in battle. There's
very little time. How many Klingons are being held here? <br>
L'KOR: Seventy three. <br>
WORF: How many Romulans guard the camp? <br>
L'KOR: Worf, there are things you do not understand. <br>
WORF: What do you mean? <br>
L'KOR: I must speak with the Elders. <br>
(he goes to the doorway and calls the others in)&nbsp;<br>
L'KOR: ghoS! I knew your father well, Worf. And I remember you. A boy,
barely able to lift a bat'leth. Once your father insisted we take you
on the ritual hunt. You were so eager, you tried to take the beast with
your bare hands. It mauled your arm. <br>
WORF: I still have the scar. I do remember you now. <br>
L'KOR: You should not have come here, Worf. <br>
WORF: I do not understand. <br>
L'KOR: You should not have come. <br>
GI'RAL: Who is this? <br>
WORF: I am Worf, son of Mogh. I have come to help you escape. <br>
L'KOR: He does not know. <br>
GI'RAL: (an old woman) He must leave at once. <br>
L'KOR: No, it is too late for that. He would bring others. vang ghaH! <br>
(The men grab him. Worf easily breaks free but Romulan soldiers stop
him at the doorway) <br>
L'KOR: We are not leaving here and neither are you.
