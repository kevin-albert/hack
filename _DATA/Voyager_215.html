is in the Mess hall, in his chef's outfit.) <br>
NEELIX: Good day, Voyager and welcome to A Briefing With Neelix. It's a
catchy title, isn't it? I'll be coming to you each and every day with
news of general interest. Interviews with our fascinating crew members.
Musical performances. Recommendations for new holodeck programmes. And
of course, previews of upcoming meals. Everything from Hlaka soup to
Zabee nuts. A Briefing With Neelix will help you stay informed about
ship's activities, er, keep you abreast of your colleague's
accomplishments and broaden your knowledge about a wealth of subjects.
But most of all, it will make you feel good, because what you see here
will always be the most uplifting, optimistic view of everything that
happens on our ship. After all, as your morale officer, isn't it my job
to bring a little joy into everyone's day? Hmm? Captain Janeway has
agreed to appear on the show with regular updates about the ship's
progress, and Commander Chakotay will commend outstanding crew members.
So snap to and keep those boots polished to a shine. You never know
when you might be featured on A Briefing With Neelix. Ready, Ensign? <br>
BAYTART [OC]: All set, Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: In just a moment, an amazing talent. Ensign Pablo Baytart will
astound you with his juggling ability. He'll keep
PADDs, hyposprays, even phasers in the air for minutes at a time. But
before that, what makes people feel better than a little romance? And
what Lieutenant in a gold uniform was recently huddled in the Mess Hall
with what crewman in blue having a very intimate conversation over a
carafe of Silmic wine? Well, I'd never name names, but you know who you
are. Best wishes to a handsome pair of lovebirds. And now, ladies and
gentlemen, Ensign Pablo Baytart. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">NEELIX:
Ladies and gentlemen, Ensign Pablo Baytart. Well? What did you think? <br>
(The EMH turns off the monitor before Baytart's juggling act appears.) <br>
EMH: I'm a doctor, not a performer. I don't have time for such
nonsense. <br>
NEELIX: I can see Hints for Healthful Living becoming a very popular
segment, Doctor. <br>
EMH: I don't think so. <br>
NEELIX: You'd be lifted to a whole new level in the crew's eyes. They'd
hang on your every word. You'd enjoy a, a popularity, a, a celebrity
that you've never known before. <br>
EMH: I would? <br>
NEELIX: You don't have to answer right away. Just think about it. </font></p>

Frosting? <br>
KIM: Deck four. Recipes, music, jugglers. It's sort of like a steady
diet of dessert, which is fine, but pretty soon you want some meat and
potatoes. <br>
NEELIX: You do? <br>
KIM: When I was in school, I was editor of the Academy newspaper for a
year. I monitored subspace transmissions. I got reports on some of the
first activity by the Maquis against the Cardassians. I wrote an
editorial about it, and the students became polarised on the issue.
They debated the pros and cons, and gained an insight into the entire
history of the political rebellion. Now, that's the power of
journalism. <br>
NEELIX: What did your professors say when you told them you were going
to publish the editorial? <br>
KIM: I didn't tell them. It's the job of a journalist to be
independent. <br>
CREWWOMAN [OC]: Bridge to Mister Neelix. You have an incoming
transmission. <br>
NEELIX: I'm heading for my quarters. Put it through there. <br>

[on monitor]: Neelix, my friend. How are you? <br>
NEELIX: Laxeth, you old dilithium scrubber. It's good to see you.
Calling to trade me some of your ill-gotten goods again? I promise you,
I never want to see another wheel of Pendrashian cheese. <br>
LAXETH [on monitor]: Those days are behind me. I'm legitimate now. I'm
communications master of a Talaxian convoy. <br>
NEELIX: Communications master? Well, you've certainly come up in the
world. Congratulations. <br>
LAXETH [on monitor]: Looks like I'll be seeing you in a few days. <br>
NEELIX: How's that? <br>
LAXETH [on monitor]: We've been asked to rendezvous with your ship.
We're going to pick up a passenger. <br>
NEELIX: Passenger? We don't carry any passengers. <br>
LAXETH [on monitor]: Apparently, it's a member of your crew. All I know
is someone wants to leave your ship and come to work for us.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Just how, exactly, did you hear that someone was leaving the ship? <br>
NEELIX: An old friend of mine is serving with a Talaxian convoy. He
told me they'd be rendezvousing with us in a few days. <br>
JANEWAY: Janeway to Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK [OC]: Yes, Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: Could you join us in my Ready room, please? <br>
TUVOK [OC]: Right away. <br>
(Tuvok enters.) <br>
JANEWAY: Lieutenant, Mister Neelix has heard on good authority that one
of our crew will be leaving the ship in a few days. Naturally, he's
curious about the identity of this person. What are the security issues
here? <br>
TUVOK: I don't believe there are any serious concerns, Captain. There
is no need to withhold this information any longer. <br>
JANEWAY: Lieutenant Paris has asked to be put off the ship. <br>
NEELIX: Tom? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sure you're aware that he's had some problems lately. <br>
NEELIX: Well, yes. <br>
TUVOK: He has been disruptive, and often sets a bad example for the
rest of the crew. <br>
NEELIX: But he seemed so determined to get those things behind him. It
means a lot to him to be respected by this crew. <br>
JANEWAY: All I can tell you is that when he was relieved of duty, he
asked me to make arrangements for him to leave the ship. I tried to
talk him out of it, but he was adamant. We detected the Talaxian
convoy, and they were more than happy to get a pilot of Tom's ability. <br>
NEELIX: I can't believe this. I never thought. Captain, may I speak
with him? <br>
JANEWAY: Of course. He's in his quarters.

PARIS: Come in. <br>
NEELIX: Hello, Tom. <br>
PARIS: Neelix! How's it going? Not good, it looks like. What's wrong? <br>
NEELIX: I hear you're leaving the ship? <br>
PARIS: Good news travels fast, I guess. Yeah, I figured there was quite
a bit more opportunity for advancement on a Talaxian convoy than there
was on the only Starfleet ship in the quadrant. <br>
NEELIX: When did you make this decision? <br>
PARIS: Truthfully? About a minute and a half after I set foot on this
ship a year ago. I knew it was a mistake to try to fit into Starfleet
again, and I should have listened to myself. A few more months in that
rehab colony would have been a hell of a lot better than being here. <br>
NEELIX: Tom, you and I have had our differences, but I thought we put
those behind us. I just hope I haven't contributed to your decision? <br>
PARIS: Neelix, no. This isn't about anybody except me. I've done this
to myself, just like always. No matter where I go or who I'm with, I
make a mess of things. The unmistakable conclusion has to be that deep
down, I don't want any friends, or a family, or a home. Otherwise, I
wouldn't keep sabotaging the possibilities. <br>
NEELIX: I thought you found those things here. <br>
PARIS: I tried. Or maybe I just told myself I was trying. I'm not sure.
Either way, it's just not working. Frankly, I'd like to get out before
I completely destroy my image. There might actually be one or two
people who still have a good opinion of me. <br>
NEELIX: I'm one of them, Tom. And I wish you wouldn't go. <br>
PARIS: Well, I thank you. But the truth is, I've always considered
myself a drifter. You know what that's like, Neelix. Freedom to do what
you want, when you want. No rules to follow, nobody depending on you,
right? <br>

EMH [on monitor]: I want to discuss the details of my participation on
your programme. I've been giving it a great deal of thought, and I've
come up with a number of ideas I think you'll find quite intriguing. <br>
NEELIX: Well, that's good news, I-I'm delighted you've decided to
become a contributor. But I'm afraid I don't have time to discuss it
right now. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: But I've already prepared today's topic. How to keep
your nostrils happy. <br>
NEELIX: That is fascinating, but I'm afraid there's a more important
story I have to work on today. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: You mean I'm not going to appear today? <br>
NEELIX: When you see it, I'm sure you will understand. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: Hmm. But I will be on tomorrow? <br>
NEELIX: Definitely. Without fail. I promise you. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: Very well. But tomorrow I'll want to cover two
topics. I have a most entertaining idea. Uncovering the hidden
mysteries of the adrenal gland. <br>

NEELIX: Good morning, Voyager. I want to tell you about a friend of
mine. I first met this man almost a year ago, and tell you the truth, I
didn't like him much. He seemed a little too cocky, a little too sure
of himself. A lot of people had questions about him. He'd proven he'd
pretty much sell himself out to the highest bidder, go wherever the
wind blew him, so people wondered, could you trust this person when
things got tough? Would he stand side by side with you, or would he let
you down when you needed him most?
But the fact of the matter is, he proved himself right from the
beginning. I wouldn't be alive right now if it weren't for him. And the
