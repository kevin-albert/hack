thing. Every night I'd tuck in my son Ahjess, and two hours later he'd
crawl into bed with me. I don't think I slept through a night for
weeks. <br>
O'BRIEN: Weeks? Molly's been doing this for two months already. <br>
DAX: She just needs a little attention. <br>
BASHIR: Dax is right. I'd say she's jealous. She knows that you and
Keiko are going to have a baby soon. <br>
O'BRIEN: What makes you such an expert on children? <br>
BASHIR: First in my class in paediatric medicine. <br>
DAX: I wouldn't sit there if I were you. <br>
BASHIR: Why? Miles spill something again? <br>
O'BRIEN: It's Worf's seat. He'll be here in a minute. <br>
BASHIR: Just because Worf lives on the Defiant full time doesn't give
him proprietary rights in the mess hall. <br>
DAX: No one says it does. He just likes that seat. <br>
(Worf enters and goes to the replicator.) <br>
WORF: Prune juice, extra large. <br>

have to keep them away from the plasma conduits. <br>
QUARK: Has anyone seen my brother Rom? He told me he was going to be
working in one of the upper pylons today. <br>
KIRA: He's fine. I saw him with one of the damage control teams on
level five. <br>
QUARK: What a relief. Wait till I find him. I'll kill him for scaring
me like that. <br>
ODO: Major, here's a preliminary list of the stolen equipment. <br>
Bashir, Dax and Sisko arrive on scene.) <br>
SISKO: Report, Major. <br>
KIRA: It was a Jem'Hadar strike team. They beamed aboard from a
civilian transport, disabled communications and weapons, set off an
explosive device in upper pylon three, fought a number of small
skirmishes <br>
(Bashir is doing triage.) <br>
BASHIR: This one's gone. Spinal fracture and severe trauma to the
cranial meninges. <br>
KIRA: They raided the science lab, the reactor control facility and
several cargo bays. <br>
SISKO: (reads Odo's PADD) Microfusion initiators, photonic amplifiers,
EPS power stabilisers. <br>
KIRA: They were out of here and through the wormhole before we knew
what hit us. <br>
BASHIR: Constable, how many casualties do we have? <br>
ODO: So far, eighteen confirmed dead, thirty one missing and over a
hundred wounded. <br>
DAX: How long ago did the Jem'Hadar leave? <br>
KIRA: Forty five minutes at the most. <br>
DAX: That means their ion trail hasn't decayed yet. We could follow
them. <br>
SISKO: I intend to do more than that. Sisko to Defiant, prepare for
departure. <br>
BASHIR: I'm going to stay here, take care of the wounded. That includes
you. <br>
SISKO: The station's yours, Major. Contact Starfleet. Tell them to get
some ships out here just in case this is a diversion. <br>
KIRA: Understood. <br>
SISKO: Constable, you're with us. Sisko to Defiant. Three to beam out. <br>

SISKO: What do you see, Dax? <br>
DAX: Nothing good. Their ion trail is getting fainter. The Jem'Hadar
must be emitting a magneton pulse to cover their tracks. <br>
SISKO: Keep on them. I want that ship. <br>
ODO: Frankly, I'm surprised that something like this hasn't happened
sooner. Being at the edge of the wormhole makes Deep Space Nine a
tempting target. <br>
SISKO: Sometimes I wish we could have the Defiant standing guard over
the station twenty six hours a day. <br>
WORF: Restricting the Defiant to guard duty would be a serious mistake.
<br>
O'BRIEN: You wouldn't say that if you had family living on the station.
<br>
WORF: Perhaps, but adopting a siege mentality is ultimately
self-defeating. <br>
DAX: I've got something. Bearing oh five seven mark zero zero nine. <br>
SISKO: Red Alert. On screen. <br>
(A damaged Jem'Hadar ship.) <br>
WORF: A Jem'Hadar warship. This can't be the vessel we're looking for.
Major Kira said the Jem'Hadar strike team that attacked the station
used a transport ship. <br>
O'BRIEN: Captain, that warship's in pretty bad shape. It looks like
someone's been using it for target practice. <br>
DAX: They're transmitting a broad-band distress signal. <br>
ODO: It could be a trap. <br>
SISKO: How many crewmembers aboard? <br>
DAX: I'm reading seven life signs. <br>
O'BRIEN: You won't be reading them for long. The reactor's about to go
critical. <br>
SISKO: Chief, have a security detail report to the transporter bay.
Odo, Commander Worf, you're with me.

SISKO: Reinstate cloak. If you're looking for your weapons, they were
removed in transport. <br>
OMET'IKLAN: Even without weapons, we're more than a match for you. <br>
WORF: I would not be so certain of that. <br>
TOMAN'TORAX: A Klingon. <br>

WEYOUN: Omet'iklan, control your men. These people saved our lives. <br>
OMET'IKLAN: And for that we shall take advantage of their mistake. <br>
WEYOUN: You'll do nothing without my approval. My apologies, Captain.
I'm afraid the Jem'Hadar are sadly deficient in the social graces. <br>
SISKO: Two hours ago, my station was attacked by a Jem'Hadar strike
team. <br>
WEYOUN: I know. They attacked us too. <br>
ODO: Why would your own people attack you? <br>
OMET'IKLAN: Tell them nothing. This is not their concern. <br>
WEYOUN: Your next allowance of white will be in two hours. If you want
it on time, you will be quiet and do as you're told. Captain, you and I
should talk in private.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Mess hall]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: If you have something to say to me, make it
quick. <br>
WEYOUN: Captain Benjamin Sisko. I feel honoured. Your psychographic
profile is required reading for Vorta field supervisors. I probably
know things about you you don't know yourself. <br>
SISKO: If you're trying to impress me, you can forget it. <br>
WEYOUN: What would you say if I offered to make you absolute ruler of
the Federation? No President, no Starfleet Chief of Staff, just you. <br>
SISKO: I'd say your psychographic profile of me isn't as good as you
think. <br>
WEYOUN: Just doing my job. Trying to build a bridge between the
Dominion and a potential ally. After all, wouldn't it be much simpler
if the Dominion and the Federation could reach some mutual beneficial
understanding without resorting to the unpleasantness of military
conflict? <br>
SISKO: I want to know how to find the Jem'Hadar who attacked my
station. If you want to build a bridge, why don't you start there? <br>
WEYOUN: I can lead you to them. But there's something I need in
exchange. <br>
SISKO: What's that? <br>
WEYOUN: I want you to help me eliminate them. The Jem'Hadar that
attacked your station are renegades. They've turned their back on their
oath of allegiance to the Dominion and it's my job to see to it that
they're punished. <br>
SISKO: Why do you need my help? You could send a whole fleet of
Jem'Hadar warships after them. <br>
WEYOUN: I'm afraid we don't have the time. Captain, are you familiar
with the <a href="../NextGen/137.htm" target="_blank">Iconians</a>?&nbsp;
<br>
SISKO: They controlled a vast interstellar empire about two hundred
thousand years ago. <br>
WEYOUN: What's important is how the Iconians controlled that empire. <br>
SISKO: The Gateways. <br>
WEYOUN: Exactly. Sophisticated transporters that allowed them to move
instantaneously from one planet to another, from one solar system to
another, without the use of starships. <br>
SISKO: What does any of this have to do with me? <br>
WEYOUN: Dominion scientists recently discovered a Gateway on one of our
outlying worlds. We sent a team of scientists to restore it, but their
Jem'Hadar guards rebelled and are now trying to complete the Gateway
themselves. <br>
SISKO: These renegade Jem'Hadar stole some equipment from my station.
EPS power stabilisers, microfusion initiators, photonic amplifiers. <br>
WEYOUN: I would say it's very possible they're going to use that
equipment to help them complete the Gateway. You understand the nature
of our dilemma? <br>
SISKO: If the Jem'Hadar are able to make the Gateway operational,
they'll become virtually invincible. <br>
WEYOUN: Our experts predict the renegades would gather support from
other Jem'Hadar units, launch a general insurrection, and effect a
complete takeover of the Dominion in less than a year. <br>
SISKO: None of which is my problem. <br>
WEYOUN: That's very shortsighted of you, Captain. Think about it. If
the Jem'Hadar seize control of the Dominion, there'll be no stopping
them. Even shutting down the wormhole won't protect the Alpha Quadrant.
With the Gateway, they could put a million Jem'Hadar warriors on any
Federation planet instantaneously. Would you care to see our
projections of Federation casualties? <br>
SISKO: Couldn't the Founders just order them to surrender? From what I
know, the Jem'Hadar have been genetically conditioned to obey them. <br>
WEYOUN: The Founders' ability to control the Jem'Hadar has been
somewhat overstated. Otherwise we never would have had to addict them
to the white. <br>
SISKO: Sounds like the Dominion isn't quite as stable as you'd like us
to believe. <br>
WEYOUN: The Dominion has endured for two thousand years, and will
continue to endure long after the Federation has crumbled into dust.
But we'll leave that to history. Right now, we have a more pressing
concern. The Gateway must be destroyed. Agreed? <br>
SISKO: Agreed.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAX: Let me get this straight. We're going to work
with the Jem'Hadar to fight the Jem'Hadar. <br>
SISKO: I don't relish this idea either, but we don't have much of a
choice. <br>
WORF: I was on the mission that discovered the Iconian homeworld. We
were forced to destroy the Gateway we found there rather than let it
fall into the hands of the Romulans, and Starfleet Command supported
our decision. <br>
DAX: If they didn't want the Romulans to get a hold of it, I'm sure
they won't want the Jem'Hadar to have it either. <br>
O'BRIEN: What are we supposed to do? Give Omet'iklan and his men their
weapons back and then hope they don't point them at us? <br>
SISKO: They're not going to get their hands on any weapons until we
reach our target. <br>
ODO: How do we know these Jem'Hadar can be trusted? They must realise
that controlling the Gateway would mean freedom for their people. <br>
SISKO: According to Weyoun, they don't know anything about the Gateway.
They think that this is just a routine search and destroy mission. Find
the renegade Jem'Hadar, eliminate them and their base. <br>
WORF: You're asking us to lie to them about our mission. It is not
honourable. <br>
O'BRIEN: There's a lot of things about this mission that bother me, but
lying to the Jem'Hadar is not on top of my list. <br>
ODO: If the Jem'Hadar find out that we've deceived them. <br>
SISKO: They're not going to find out anything. <br>
DAX: Well, they won't hear it from me. <br>
SISKO: There'll be a joint briefing session at nineteen hundred hours. <br>
O'BRIEN: Followed by a get-to-know-you buffet at nineteen thirty. <br>
DAX: And I forgot my dress uniform.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Enter. <br>
OMET'IKLAN: You requested my presence. <br>
SISKO: It seems we're going to be working together. <br>
OMET'IKLAN: So I am told. Luckily for you, the only thing I despise
more than the Federation is a Jem'Hadar soldier who breaks his vow of
allegiance. <br>
SISKO: I'm glad you see it that way. Now, I have a few things I want to
make clear. First, this is my ship and my command. which means I give
the orders, not you and not Weyoun. What's more, I'm holding you
personally responsible for the actions of your men. If I have a problem
with them, you're the one who's going to have to answer for it. <br>
OMET'IKLAN: That's as it should be. After all, I'm the First. <br>
SISKO: As far as I'm concerned, on this mission, I'm the First. <br>
They lock eyes, and neither blinks.) <br>
OMET'IKLAN: Until the traitors are found and terminated. After that, we
shall see. Am I dismissed? <br>
SISKO: For the time being.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Mess hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: According to Dominion intelligence, the
Jem'Hadar have established a base camp here. <br>
(Sisko points to the wall monitor, tactical scan O-47 or D-47, I can't
quite make it out.) <br>
SISKO: The interior of the structure is riddled with a network of
corridors and interlocking chambers. <br>
SISKO: our primary objective is to destroy the Jem'Hadar arms and
supply cache in this chamber. The trick will be getting there. We can't
beam directly into the structure, which means we'll have to fight our
way in. <br>
OMET'IKLAN: Jem'Hadar tactics dictate at least twenty seven soldiers
are stationed inside the base camp at all times. Nine will patrol the
perimeter. Additional troops are deployed throughout the city. <br>
WORF: How many renegades are there all together? <br>
OMET'IKLAN: A hundred and sixty two in the original garrison. We killed
at least twelve during the initial rebellion. <br>
O'BRIEN: That still leaves a hundred and fifty. <br>
DAX: Just between you and me, Captain, I think we're a little
outnumbered. <br>
O'BRIEN: Wouldn't it be simpler to take out the base from orbit? A
couple of quantum torpedoes should be enough to level the entire area. <br>
SISKO: Unfortunately, that's not an option. <br>
WEYOUN: The central structure is composed of solid neutronium. Even a
direct hit from a quantum torpedo wouldn't necessarily destroy our
objective. <br>
SISKO: Which means we have to go in ourselves. <br>
TOMAN'TORAX: As it should be. It is our duty to punish those who would
break their vow of loyalty. <br>
ODO: Are you accusing me of something? <br>
OMET'IKLAN: It is not for us to accuse a god of betraying heaven. The
gods themselves will sit in judgement over you. <br>
ODO: I'm no god, and neither are the Founders. The sooner you realise
that, the better off you'll be. <br>
SISKO: We've chosen a beam-in site here, in this wooded area. That'll
give us a chance to evaluate the situation before proceeding. Our first
objective will be to secure the main entrance to the ziggurat. <br>
WORF: Neutralising nine guards before one of them can raise an alarm
will be difficult. <br>
VIRAK'KARA: It's as you said. The Klingon will to fight pales in
comparison to our own. <br>
TOMAN'TORAX: Yes. He has the look of a warrior but the heart of a
coward. <br>
WORF: If you would like to test my courage, I <br>
SISKO: All right, that's enough. <br>
TOMAN'TORAX: One day the Klingon Empire will fall before the Jem'Hadar.
And when that day comes, and piles of Klingons lie dead at my feet, I
will think of you standing here impotent and weak, and I will laugh. <br>
(Worf grabs the Jem'Hadar around the neck while Toman'torax grabs
Worf's throat.) <br>
SISKO: All right! I said that's enough. Worf, let him go! <br>
OMET'IKLAN: Second! Release the Klingon or I will kill you where you
stand. <br>
(They let go of each other.) <br>
SISKO: Now, the two of you, as you were. I promise, you'll both have
more fight than you can handle before this is over.

WEYOUN: The Jem'Hadar defence grid is now in operation. Automated
weapons systems have killed everyone in this room. <br>
OMET'IKLAN: Your crew failed in their mission. <br>
DAX: Well you might as well tell us. Where's the other one? <br>
OMET'IKLAN: There was no third guard. <br>
SISKO: I don't understand. You told me the Jem'Hadar soldiers always
operate in teams of three. <br>
OMET'IKLAN: In battle, nothing is certain. You should have armed the
explosives as soon as you were in position. <br>
WORF: We had to be sure the room was secure. otherwise someone could
have disarmed the explosive the moment we left. <br>
OMET'IKLAN: If you couldn't secure the room, you should not plan on
leaving it. <br>
O'BRIEN: You want us to blow the place up while we're still in it? <br>
OMET'IKLAN: This is a waste of time. They'll never succeed as long as
they value their lives more than victory. <br>
WEYOUN: There's something to be said for soldiers who aren't afraid to
die. <br>
SISKO: I don't know. I've found nothing keeps me alert quite like a
healthy fear of death. Keep practicing. The two of you, with me.

But the fact is, we are more loyal to the Founders than the Vorta ever

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: No women? I'm not surprised. <br>
ODO: Personally, I envy them. I mean their ability to go without sleep.
I'm sure I could be more productive if I didn't have to regenerate
every day. <br>
WORF: What is the point of doing battle if you cannot enjoy the fruits
of victory? <br>
O'BRIEN: You mean sleep? <br>
WORF: No, I mean spending long nights singing songs of your deeds. Good
food, good drink. <br>
DAX: And good women. <br>
WORF: We consider Klingon women our partners in battle. They are the
mothers of our children. <br>
DAX: And a lot of fun at parties too. <br>
WORF: True. <br>
ODO: Why does he keep staring at us? <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't think it's us he's staring at. I think it's you. <br>
DAX: The Vorta probably consider the Founders gods just like the
Jem'Hadar do. <br>
ODO: I am not a Founder. <br>
DAX: Well, you're a changeling. That's close enough. To them. <br>
O'BRIEN: I wonder what would happen if you went over to him and ordered
him to stand on his head? <br>
(The Jem'Hadar troop in with the box and place it on Weyoun's table.) <br>
OMET'IKLAN: It's time. <br>
WEYOUN: It is time when I say it's time. Oh, very well. (to box)
Prepare six phials. Unlock. First Omet'iklan, can you vouch for the
loyalty of your men? <br>
OMET'IKLAN: We pledge our loyalty to the Founders from now until death.
<br>
WEYOUN: Then receive this reward from the Founders. May it keep you
strong. <br>
(The phials of white are handed out and inserted.)&nbsp;<br>
O'BRIEN: I guess that's one way to ensure loyalty. <br>
WORF: Loyalty bought at such a price is no loyalty at all. <br>
OMET'IKLAN: Resume your training. <br>
TOMAN'TORAX: Human, come with me. It is time to resume our battle
drills. <br>
O'BRIEN: In a minute. <br>
TOMAN'TORAX: I'm ready now. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, I'm not. <br>
TOMAN'TORAX: They stuff themselves with food but have no appetite for
battle. <br>
WORF: When the time comes, you will find us more than ready. <br>
TOMAN'TORAX: Ready to flee at the first sign of danger. Let's go. You
can practice running away. <br>
(Toman'torax grabs O'Brien's shoulder so Worf hits Toman'torax.) <br>
TOMAN'TORAX: I've always wanted to kill a Klingon. <br>
(And a general brawl breaks out. Sisko enters) <br>
SISKO: That's enough! The next one who throws a punch will have to
answer to me. Now, I want to know who started this. <br>
WORF: I did. <br>
TOMAN'TORAX: And I. <br>
OMET'IKLAN: You again. You knew my orders. <br>
TOMAN'TORAX: And I defied them. I deserve punishment. <br>
OMET'IKLAN: And you shall have it. <br>
(Omet'iklan stands behind Toman'torax and kills him.) <br>
OMET'IKLAN: Why are you waiting? Kill him and be done with it. <br>
SISKO: Mister Worf, when not on duty, you are confined to quarters for
the remainder of this mission. <br>
WORF: Yes, sir. <br>
(Worf leaves) <br>
SISKO: All right, let's break this up. Get back to your stations or go
to your quarters. Either way, I want this room cleared. Now! <br>
(The crew leave.) <br>
OMET'IKLAN: You call that discipline? <br>
SISKO: A dead man can't learn from his mistakes. I don't get the same
joy out of killing as you do. <br>
OMET'IKLAN: You think I enjoyed it? Toman'torax was my Second. He
served under me three years. I valued him. <br>
SISKO: You have a funny way of showing it. <br>
OMET'IKLAN: I did what had to be done, what any First would do. I
placed the good of the unit above my personal feelings. Any soldier who
cannot follow orders is a danger to his unit and must be eliminated. <br>
SISKO: Mister Worf is not a danger to my command. But if I eliminate
him for a simple breach of discipline, then I would be. My men would
stop trusting me, and I wouldn't blame them. <br>
OMET'IKLAN: You are weak. You should die in his place. And when this
mission is over, I will see that you do.

WEYOUN: Odo, may I speak with you for a moment? <br>
ODO: A moment. <br>
WEYOUN: You know I've been watching you. <br>
ODO: I've noticed. <br>
WEYOUN: I have to admit I find it somewhat disturbing seeing you
working for these Federation people, letting them order you around. You
are a Founder. You should be the one giving the orders to them, to the
Jem'Hadar, even me. <br>
ODO: So if I order you to leave me alone, you will? <br>
WEYOUN: Of course. But before you do, please, hear what I have to say.
Your people want you to come home, Odo. No matter what differences you
may have with them, no matter what mistakes you may have made, they
still love you. <br>
ODO: Well maybe they do, but I don't love them. <br>
WEYOUN: You're lying. And you're not very good at it. I, on the other
hand, am an expert on lies. Both in telling them, and in spotting them.
So you may as well admit the truth. More than anything in your life,
you want to return to your people. And I can make that possible. <br>
ODO: How? <br>
WEYOUN: Let me worry about the how. All I need to know is, are you
ready to go home? <br>
ODO: No. But I am ready to end this conversation. <br>
WEYOUN: Then it's over. After all, you are a Founder. I live to serve
you.

O'BRIEN: Commander? <br>
DAX: For Keiko? <br>
O'BRIEN: It's my eleventh goodbye message since we've been married. I
average almost two a year. <br>
DAX: Does she know you do this? <br>
O'BRIEN: What would I tell her? You know, honey, every time I'm about
to go into battle I record a message for you and Molly telling how much
I love you, just in case. <br>
DAX: She'd probably think it was sweet. <br>
O'BRIEN: It'd probably scare the hell out of her. To be honest, it
scares the hell out of me. Every time I record one of these I think,
this is it. This is the one they're going to end up hearing. <br>
DAX: It'll never happen. <br>
O'BRIEN: What makes you say that? <br>
DAX: Because when you've lived eight lifetimes, you develop certain
instincts. And my instincts tell me that you, Miles Edward O'Brien, are
going to live to be a hundred and forty and die in bed, surrounded by
family and friends. <br>
O'BRIEN: Do you really believe that? <br>
DAX: Do you? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'd like to. <br>
DAX: That's all that matters. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, just to be on the safe side, maybe you'd better enter
this in the ship's log anyway. <br>
DAX: I'll put it right alongside my message to my mother. <br>
O'BRIEN: You record these, too? <br>
DAX: Doesn't everyone?

SISKO: Well, it looks like the upgraded reactant injectors are working
better than we thought. <br>
WORF: Captain. <br>
SISKO: Mister Worf. Battle drills ended ten minutes ago. You should be
in your quarters. <br>
WORF: I'm on my way. <br>
SISKO: It looks like you got a little lost. <br>
WORF: There is something I wish to discuss with you. <br>
SISKO: Go on. <br>
WORF: It has come to my attention that First Omet'iklan has threatened
to kill you. <br>
SISKO: I didn't know that was public knowledge. <br>
WORF: You told Commander Dax. <br>
SISKO: Well, that explains it. <br>
WORF: She's concerned about you, and for good reason. As your executive
officer, I recommend that you remain on the ship during the away
mission. That way, Omet'iklan will have no opportunity to carry out his
threat. <br>
SISKO: I appreciate the concern, but do you really think I'm going to
follow that recommendation? <br>
WORF: No, sir, I do not. But I hope you will take some advice. Do not
turn your back on him. <br>
SISKO: I won't. <br>
WORF: Good. I also want you to know if somehow he does carry out his
threat, he will not live to boast about it. <br>
SISKO: That's very reassuring, Mister Worf. <br>
DAX [OC]: Dax to Sisko. <br>
SISKO: Sisko here. <br>
DAX [OC]: We're approaching Vandros Four, Captain. <br>
SISKO: On my way.

drill. They're fully charged. <br>
VIRAK'KARA: The weapon's set on stun. <br>
OMET'IKLAN: Deactivate safeties. Reset weapons to maximum power. <br>
WEYOUN: Well, this is a momentous occasion. The first joint operation
between the Federation and the Dominion. I can't wait to see how it
turns out. <br>
SISKO: Prepare to transport. <br>
OMET'IKLAN: Wait. I am First Omet'iklan, and I am dead. As of this
moment we are all dead. We go into battle to reclaim our lives. This we
do gladly, for we are Jem'Hadar. Remember. Victory is life. <br>
JEM'HADAR: Victory is life. <br>

WORF: Something must be interfering with our equipment. <br>
DAX: The Gateway. It's probably generating some kind of dampening
