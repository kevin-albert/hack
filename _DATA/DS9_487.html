semi-bat'leth the length of his forearm. He breaks Dax's bat'leth and
puts his weapon to her neck.) <br>
WORF: E-cha! <br>
DAX: Movek. Okay. I see your point. The mek'leth definitely have its
advantages. But I still think the bat'leth, with its longer reach, is
usually the deciding factor. <br>
WORF: That is a classic argument. However, I find using a large and
intimidating weapon like a bat'leth often leads to overconfidence. <br>
DAX: So you think that I was overconfident? <br>
WORF: You were overconfident. You thought by distracting me with your
outfit you would gain an advantage. <br>

DAX: My outfit? <br>
WORF: Er, I thought that. I mean, I only assumed that <br>

bat'leth against his throat.) <br>

WORF: Movek. <br>
DAX: But in my own defence, you do try your own tactics of distraction
with all that shouting and growling you do. <br>

WORF: Worf here. <br>

intoxicated Klingon here who's demanding to see you. <br>

KURN: The sons of Mogh reunited one last time. <br>
WORF: Where have you been? I have tried to contact you for months. <br>
KURN: Well, I'm here now, but not for long. Soon there will be only one

he wakes.) <br>

WORF: You are not in the holding cell. You're in my quarters. <br>
(There is a glass with green liquid on a table by the settee.) <br>
WORF: For your head. <br>
KURN: Soft, comfortable, just like the rest of these quarters. No one
would ever suspect a warrior lives here. <br>
WORF: It serves me. <br>
KURN: Always defending the Federation. Tell me, Worf, does Starfleet
ever make mistakes even in their furniture? <br>
WORF: Kurn, where have you been? It has been four months since your
last message. <br>
KURN: I've been overseeing the end of a once-proud house. Perhaps
you've heard of it. It was called the House of Mogh. <br>
WORF: I know what has happened. I regret that by opposing Gowron I have
brought disgrace to our family. <br>
KURN: You regret? What's next, Worf? Do you want to apologise to me?
Express your sympathy? How many human weaknesses will you display? <br>
WORF: I do not apologise for what I have done. I could not join Gowron
in his war with Cardassia or the Federation. It would have been
dishonourable. <br>
KURN: Oh, so in avoiding dishonour for yourself, you brought it on the
rest of your family. What a noble act. How selfless. <br>
WORF: I will not debate this with you, Kurn. What is done is done. <br>
KURN: For you, it's done. You and your comfortable Federation life,
your glorious Starfleet career. But not for me. Our family had a seat
on the High Council. We were feared by our enemies, respected by our
friends. It was even said that if Gowron died the leadership of the
Council might be passed to someone from the House of Mogh. Then you
chose to side with the Federation against the Empire. Gowron took our
ships, our land, our seat on the Council, everything. <br>
WORF: Kurn, I know this has been difficult for you. <br>
KURN: What do you know? Did you watch as Gowron's men seized our land
and stripped our family of its name? Did you have to endure the
humiliation of being ejected from the High Council in front of the
Emperor himself? No. You chose to stay here, safe, comfortable, secure.
You have everything you want and I have nothing, not even my honour.
But you can give that back to me. <br>
WORF: By killing you? <br>
KURN: I'm already dead to our people, and so are you, but you don't
care. I have never asked you for anything, but you took away my honour
and only you can give it back. So now, I am asking you for Mauk-to'Vor.
Is an honourable death too much to ask from my brother?

O'BRIEN: Sorry, Major. It's just we're almost home. <br>

BAJORAN [OC]: Bajoran Control to Yukon. You are cleared to enter the

O'BRIEN: Let's not get crazy. If you really want some good <br>
(Big flash outside) <br>
KIRA: What was that? <br>
O'BRIEN: Some kind of high energy discharge. It was pretty close. Only
five thousand kilometres from here. <br>
KIRA: Just outside Bajoran space. Elevated tachyon readings, subspace
shockwaves. Looks like a cloaked ship exploded. <br>
O'BRIEN: There's no debris, no residual warp fields. <br>
KIRA: Something exploded. Let's take a closer look. Bring us to five
hundred metres from those coordinates. <br>
O'BRIEN: Approaching the coordinates. I'm not seeing any signs of. Wait
a minute. I'm picking up another tachyon surge. A ship's decloaking
directly ahead of us. <br>
(A Klingon Bird of Prey decloaks) <br>
KLINGON [OC]: Federation vessel. This is the Imperial Klingon Ship
Korinar. We are engaged in military exercises in this area. You will
alter course and return to Bajoran space immediately. <br>
KIRA: This is Major Kira Nerys. We're investigating an explosion which
happened at these coordinates. <br>
KLINGON [OC]: You have been given a warning according to interstellar
agreements. You will not receive another. <br>
O'BRIEN: They've locked their disruptors onto us, Major. <br>
KIRA: Take us home, Chief. But keep scanning the coordinates of that
explosion. There's a lot more going on out here than just military

QUARK: As if you're never late. <br>
DAX: Worf is never late. In fact, he grumbles at me if I'm two minutes
behind schedule. <br>
QUARK: Well, I haven't seen him since this morning. And if he can't at
least be civil, I don't care to see him in my bar again. <br>
DAX: It's just his way. It's nothing personal, Quark. <br>
QUARK: No, this was more than his standard rudeness. He came in here,
ordered some Klingon incense and nearly threw me across the bar when I
tried to give him some replicated incense. <br>
DAX: What kind of Klingon incense? <br>
QUARK: Something called adanji. <br>
DAX: Why would he want adanji? <br>
QUARK: Why? Is there something special about adanji? <br>

WORF: You are well within your right to do so. <br>
SISKO: I didn't ask you about my rights. Answer my question. <br>
WORF: Captain, I do not have an answer. Sir, I realise my actions were
in violation of Starfleet regulations, but <br>
SISKO: Regulations? We're not talking about some obscure technicality,
Mister Worf. You tried to commit premeditated murder. <br>
DAX: Benjamin, it wasn't murder. Worf and Kurn were performing a
Mauk-to'Vor ritual. It's part of Klingon belief that when <br>
SISKO: At the moment, I don't give a damn about Klingon beliefs,
rituals or custom. Now I have given you both a lot of leeway when it
comes to following Klingon traditions, but in case you haven't noticed,
this is not a Klingon station, and those are not Klingon uniforms
you're wearing. There is a limit to how far I'll go to accommodate
cultural diversity among my officers and you've just reached it. When
your brother is released from the infirmary, you better find another
way to settle your family problems. Is that clear? <br>
WORF: Captain, it may not be possible to <br>
DAX: It's clear. There are definitely other possibilities for Kurn.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: What do you make of it, Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: From these magnetic flux readings, the energy discharge we
detected could've been caused by the destruction of a cloaked target
drone. <br>
KIRA: Which would support their story about conducting military
manoeuvres. <br>
O'BRIEN: On the other hand this type of explosion could also have been
caused by an accidental warp nacelle inversion. <br>
KIRA: Or a blown plasma conduit, or a dozen other things. The bottom
line is, there's no way to be certain from these readings. <br>
SISKO: The larger question is, what are these Klingons up to? <br>
KIRA: Whatever it is, they're doing it awfully close to Bajoran space. <br>
O'BRIEN: And they're very touchy about it. <br>
SISKO: One thing I've had enough of is tiptoeing around Klingons. Take
the Defiant and run a sensor sweep of those coordinates. <br>
KIRA: And if I run into the Klingons? <br>
SISKO: Tell them that the ship is conducting military exercises
according to interstellar agreements. <br>
KIRA: Understood. Should I take Worf? <br>
SISKO: I don't want Worf anywhere near other Klingons right now. Keep
him informed of what's going on, but under no circumstances is he to
accompany you. Is that clear? <br>
KIRA: Yes, sir. <br>

father there. <br>
WORF: He still awaits you, but it is not yet time for you to join him. <br>
KURN: And I suppose you will decide when that time has come? <br>
WORF: It is not for me to make that choice. <br>

KURN: Did you fight them? Did you threaten to kill them both if they
interfered? And are you standing here now with the mevak dagger ready
to slit my throat and bring me the death I deserve? No. For a moment in
your quarters during the ritual you were Klingon. But your Federation
life has claimed you again and now it is claiming me as well. I have no

of their casualties. I've treated fifteen cases of severe radiation
burns, seven thoracic perforation traumas caused by shrapnel and twenty
three decompression related injuries. All just what you'd expect
following an explosion on a starship. <br>
SISKO: Do you have any idea what caused the explosion? <br>
BASHIR: Well, the radiation burns were the result of exposure to gamma
rays. My guess is they were hit by a photon torpedo. <br>
SISKO: A torpedo? <br>
O'BRIEN: From the fracture pattern of the damage, I'd say something
exploded about ten kilometres off their port quarter. <br>
DAX: But torpedoes leave ion trails, and the Defiant didn't pick up any
in the vicinity. <br>
KIRA: And the Drovana was cloaked. Even Klingon torpedoes can't track
vessels operating under cloak. <br>
WORF: Mines. They hit a mine. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's why there weren't any ion trails. <br>
DAX: And cloaked mines can't be detected by any known sensor array. <br>

the system since that explosion. Why haven't they struck any mines? <br>
WORF: The type of mine currently used by the Klingons remains dormant
until it is armed by a coded subspace signal. <br>
O'BRIEN: The mine that damaged the Drovana must've malfunctioned or
been set off prematurely. <br>
DAX: If we're right, there could be thousands of mines out there right
now and we'd have no way of knowing it. <br>
BASHIR: Mining a star system is an act of war. I didn't think the
Klingons were ready for that. <br>
SISKO: At the moment we can't even prove these mines exist. But if war
comes, the Klingons would be able to cut off Deep Space Nine and the
entire Bajoran system. <br>
KIRA: How do we find these mines? <br>
DAX: Unless we know their coordinates, there's no way to find them
until we run into one. <br>
O'BRIEN: Then we'd better get those coordinates. <br>
KIRA: The place to get them is docked at upper pylon three right now.
The only question is how? <br>
WORF: I have an idea. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KURN: You want me to turn against my own people?
Will my dishonour never end? <br>
WORF: It is their actions that are dishonourable. Secretly mining star
systems is not the act of warriors. They behave like, like Romulan
cowards. <br>
KURN: Is that how you rationalise this? By calling your people cowards
so you can be a hero? <br>
WORF: Kurn, let me ask you this. Do you agree with what has happened
between the Empire and the Federation? <br>
KURN: It is not my place to criticise. <br>
WORF: Answer the question! <br>
KURN: No. I opposed the decision to break the treaty but I was
overruled in Council. <br>
WORF: Why did you oppose the decision? <br>
KURN: Because Gowron underestimates the Federation. He thinks they're
soft, weak, and he is wrong. Sooner or later there will be war. <br>
WORF: A war the Empire may lose. <br>
KURN: Yes. <br>
WORF: You know that mining this system is just the beginning. If we do
nothing, it will only encourage Gowron to continue thinking of the
Federation as weak. Eventually he will attack, and that will be the end
of the Empire. That is why you must join me on this mission. Not for my
honour, and not for the Federation, but to prevent the Empire from
being destroyed in a war they cannot win. Our people have turned their
backs on us but we have not turned our backs on them. Let it be the
Sons of Mogh, side by side, saving our people. Do this with me.

in the defence system database. <br>
WORF: I have found the main file directory. <br>
KURN: No, no, ignore it. It's a security procedure the High Council
instituted three months ago. False directories, files, entire databases
of disinformation designed for spies to steal. Here's the real
database. <br>
WORF: Can you access the deployment plan? <br>
KURN: My security codes have been changed, but not all of them. Yes. <br>
(A Klingon enters.) <br>
OFFICER: You two. What are you doing? <br>
KURN: We're running a diagnostic on the computer core. There have been
power fluctuations in the navigational control system. <br>
OFFICER: I've not been informed of any computer problems. <br>
WORF: Perhaps you have not been tending to your duties. <br>
OFFICER: I do not know you. What is your name? <br>
WORF: I am Commander Sorval, son of M'tokra. <br>
OFFICER: How long have you been aboard, Commander? <br>
WORF: I will not be questioned by a Lieutenant who should be cleaning
my quarters. Leave us, or I shall have you stripped of rank and sent
home in a transport! <br>
OFFICER: My words were ill-chosen, Commander. Perhaps I can help in
your investigation. <br>
WORF: That will not be necessary. All that we require is <br>
(Kurn pulls Worf out of the way and kills the Klingon.) <br>
WORF: You did not have to do that. He was backing down. <br>
(Kurn picks up a small knife.) <br>
KURN: He was going to kill you. <br>
WORF: We must hurry. The disruptor blast will alert the security
sensors. <br>
KURN: He was a warrior doing his duty defending the Empire, and I
killed him. My dishonour is complete.

WORF: Thank you, sir. <br>
(Sisko leaves.) <br>
DAX: You don't seem very pleased. <br>
WORF: I am still troubled by the death of that Klingon officer. <br>
DAX: Your report said it was self-defence. <br>
WORF: That us not the point. I should have seen what he was going to
do. <br>
DAX: What do you mean? From the way you described it, he was standing
so close to you, you couldn't have seen the knife in his hand. <br>
WORF: He decided to kill me while I was looking him right in the eyes
and I never saw it. But Kurn did, and he was three metres away. <br>
DAX: Worf, I don't think you can tell someone's going to kill you by
looking at them. <br>
WORF: A Klingon can. It is an instinct. The ability to look someone in
the eyes and see the decision to kill. An instinct I no longer have.
Kurn was right. I have lived with humans so long I no longer think like
a Klingon. For a long time I have tried to walk the line between the
Empire and the Federation. I told myself I could live in either world,
that it was my choice. But the truth is, I cannot go back to the
Empire. <br>
DAX: Do you want to go back? <br>
WORF: I had always hoped that one day the House of Mogh would reclaim
its rightful place and that I would return. But now I know that even if
I did, I have no place there. This is all I have. <br>
DAX: Is that enough? <br>
WORF: It will have to be. But my brother does not even have this. For
him there is no future without the Empire. No life. <br>
DAX: Sounds like you're thinking of carrying out the Mauk-to'Vor ritual
again. <br>
WORF: No. I was able to do it once by telling myself it was an
honourable Klingon ritual. But now I cannot help but think of it as
humans do. As murder. <br>
DAX: What if there was a way for you to kill your brother without
killing him?

Anything? <br>
O'BRIEN: Nothing. If they're out there, they're keeping quiet. <br>
KIRA: Oh, they're out there all right, and I think we'll be seeing them
fairly soon. Prepare to detonate the mine in grid twenty one alpha. <br>

is pointing the gun at his head.) <br>
KURN: Why is it that suicide is considered a dishonourable death, Worf?
Shouldn't a warrior have the right to decide when his time has come? <br>
WORF: If you die by your own hand you will not travel across the River
of Blood and enter Sto'Vo'kor. <br>
KURN: Even if I got cast down into the Underworld, at least I'd be with
other Klingons, even though they are the dishonoured dead. <br>
WORF: Put down the disruptor. <br>

KURN: Do you know what my one regret is, Worf? That we weren't raised
together. In the Empire, on Earth, it wouldn't have mattered, but the
Sons of Mogh should have never been separated. <br>
WORF: On that we both agree. <br>
KURN: But that is the past, and a warrior should look to the future. <br>

DAX: How long will the procedure take? <br>
BASHIR: Well, wiping his memory is relatively simple, say an hour. But
changing his genetic coding, combined with surgically altering his
features will take at least another five hours. <br>
WORF: What will he remember? <br>
BASHIR: He'll know he's a Klingon, and how to speak the language, and
virtually everything he needs to know in order to survive, except who
he is. And that's the first question he'll ask. Who am I? Do you have
an answer? <br>
WORF: There is a man named Noggra, a friend of our father's. He will be
arriving in a few hours. He has agreed to provide Kurn with a new
identity and a new family. He will supply Kurn with all the answers he
needs. <br>
BASHIR: Are you absolutely certain about this, Worf? Once I've erase
his memory engrams it'll be almost impossible to restore them. He won't
remember you or anything about his real life. <br>

anything. <br>
