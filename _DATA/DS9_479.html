Captain's log, stardate 49263.5. At the request of the Karemma Commerce
Ministry, we've brought the Defiant to a remote system in the Gamma
Quadrant to discuss problems that have surfaced regarding our recent
trade agreement.
</font>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HANOK: When we first agreed to use the Ferengi as
intermediaries, we did it because we knew the Dominion would never
tolerate direct trade between us and the Federation. <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000342/" target="_blank"> James Cromwell</a> under the latex
again.) <br>
QUARK: And we're glad to be of service. I'm happy to say that not a
single Ferengi vessel has been stopped by the Jem'Hadar. <br>
HANOK: Unfortunately, we have found there is little profit in doing
business with the Federation. In order to comply with your all commerce
laws, we have had to pay a series of taxes and fees that have made the
costs too high. <br>
SISKO: What sort of taxes and fees are you referring to? <br>
HANOK: For example, on a recent shipment of Karemman Fleece, a four
percent surcharge was added to inspect the cargo for changeling
infiltrators. <br>
SISKO: What? <br>
QUARK: You never know where they might be hiding. <br>
HANOK: And a six percent tariff was imposed to help offset the lost
income of Tarkalian sheep herders. <br>
QUARK: Hardworking people. You have to feel for them. <br>
HANOK: Need I go on, Captain? <br>
SISKO: No. I think you've made your point. <br>
(And Quark gets a very stern Look.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CARSON: (a crewwoman) These are the results of the
last weapons drill, sir. <br>
WORF: These response times are unacceptable, Ensign. <br>
CARSON: They are a little high, sir, but not if you take into account
that <br>
WORF: I want these response times reduced by fifteen percent. Schedule
another drill. <br>
CARSON: Yes, sir. <br>
(Dax sips a drink and proffers a plate of bon-bons.) <br>
DAX: Want one? <br>
KIRA: I'm fasting. Today is Ha'mara. <br>
DAX: Ha'mara? <br>
KIRA: It's the anniversary of the Emissary's arrival. We fast to show
our gratitude to the Prophets for sending him to us. Last night, there
was a Festival of Lights in the Capital. <br>
DAX: Sounds beautiful. Sorry we missed it. <br>
KIRA: Something tells me the Captain scheduled these negotiations so he
wouldn't have to attend. <br>
DAX: Benjamin's never been one for ceremonies, especially where he's
the centre of attention. <br>
KIRA: Oh, I understand how the Captain feels. Still, it would have
meant a lot if the Emissary had been there. <br>
DAX: After being stuck in the mess hall all morning with Quark and
Hanok, I bet he wishes he had gone. <br>
CARSON: Two ships have just entered sensor range. They're Jem'Hadar
warships. <br>
WORF: Red alert. Captain Sisko to the Bridge. All hands battle
stations. <br>
(Sisko and Hanok enter after the opening titles) <br>
WORF: The Jem'Hadar are powering their weapons systems. They are
targeting the Karemma ship. <br>
HANOK: They're here to punish us for meeting with you. If I give myself
up and assume full responsibility, they may spare my ship. <br>
SISKO: I'm not about to turn you over to them. Open a channel. This is
Captain Benjamin Sisko of the USS Defiant. Stand down or we'll be
forced to <br>
(Bang!) <br>
SISKO: Return fire. <br>
DAX: The Karemma ship is coming about. They're moving away, Captain. <br>
SISKO: Tell your people to hold position. We can't protect them if they
run. <br>
KIRA: The Karemma aren't responding to our hails. <br>
WORF: The Jem'Hadar are changing course. They're going after the
Karemma ship. <br>
SISKO: Move to intercept. <br>
(The Karemma ship dives for the planet) <br>
DAX: What are they doing? <br>
HANOK: They're hoping that the Jem'Hadar won't follow them into the
atmosphere. <br>
KIRA: They'd be smart not to. That's a class J gas giant. I'm reading
wind speeds of over ten thousand kilometres per hour. <br>
HANOK: Twenty three of my people are on that ship and they're going to
die because I was foolish enough to defy the Dominion. <br>
SISKO: They're not going to die, Minister. Not if I can help it. Sisko
to O'Brien.

KIRA: There's so much interference our imaging systems are practically
useless. <br>
DAX: We've hit a cross-current. <br>
SISKO: Head into it. <br>
KIRA: We've slipped between two thermal layers. Wind velocities are a
little more manageable here. <br>
SISKO: Hold this altitude. Any sign of the Karemma or the Jem'Hadar? <br>
WORF: No, but sensor range is less than two kilometres. <br>
DAX: There might be a way we can increase it. <br>
SISKO: Let's do it. Mister Hanok, I think it'd be best if you returned
to the mess hall. <br>
HANOK: As you wish, Captain. <br>
(Hanok is escorted off) <br>
SISKO: Mister Worf? <br>
WORF: Sir. <br>
SISKO: What's the status of our weapons systems? <br>
WORF: The cloak is not effective in this atmosphere, and the
interference will jam our torpedo guidance systems. <br>
SISKO: What about phasers? <br>
WORF: We'll have to target them manually. <br>
DAX: Benjamin, we have an idea. <br>
KIRA: It's a little trick I learned during the occupation. Sometimes
we'd evade the Cardassian ships by hiding in the Badlands. Sensor range
was limited, so we learned to use an old active-scan system to
navigate. <br>
DAX: It works by echo-location. We send out a modulated tetryon pulse,
and if it reflects off the hull of a ship we can approximate its
location. <br>
SISKO: But won't these pulses give away our position as well? <br>
KIRA: We'd have to alter course and speed after every one. <br>

QUARK: I think I've found the problem. I made the mistake of letting my
brother Rom execute these contracts. <br>
HANOK: Your brother? <br>
QUARK: Yes. I'm ashamed to say it, but he's an idiot. You see, the
Federation and the Karemma have very different laws governing commerce,
and I think poor Rom must've gotten confused by all the legalisms. Now,
I will be more than willing to make up any losses you might have
encountered. In fact, I will pay them back with interest. <br>
HANOK: You cheated me, Quark, and you haven't even have the courage to
admit it. If we survive this, I'll see that you never work in the Gamma

creating it. Factor in transportation costs and a reasonable profit
margin, and you arrive at a fair price. <br>
QUARK: You make it sound so antiseptic. Where's the bargaining, where's
the scheming, where's the greed? <br>
HANOK: Greed leads to misjudgment, and that can result in a loss of
profits. <br>
QUARK: If there's no risk, there's no thrill. Your way is just barter.
If you want to win big, you've got to be willing to play the odds. It's
like gambling. <br>
HANOK: Gambling is the last recourse of the desperate. Only a fool
would risk losing what he has to chance.

rotation, because that would give people a little more flexibility with
their time. There is a downside because that would mean that every
shift would have to. What am I doing? I'm supposed to keep you awake,
not bore you to tears. I'm sorry. I don't know why this is so hard for
me. All I have to do is talk to you. I mean, what do we usually talk
about? <br>
SISKO: (painful whisper) We talk about work. <br>
KIRA: You're right. That is what we usually talk about. Even when we're
not working. I get the feeling it's not that way between you and Dax,
or you and Chief O'Brien. But then, you're not a revered figure in
their religions. I know you don't like it when I talk about you as the
Emissary, but that's how I think of you. And maybe that's why sometimes
it's hard for me to relax around you. <br>
SISKO: Nerys? <br>
KIRA: Yes, sir? <br>
SISKO: Tell me a story. <br>
KIRA: All right. All right. Do you know the one about the three
brothers who go to Jo'kala? <br>
SISKO: No. <br>
KIRA: They were kava farmers, and one day they go into their field and
they see the biggest kava root they'd ever seen. It's as big as a
house. That's going to make us rich, said the oldest. So they decided
to sell it in the city.

hard. You have to understand, they're out of their element. They're not
bridge officers, they haven't been to Starfleet Academy. They're
engineers. They're used to being given a problem to solve, then going
out and figuring out how to do it. <br>
