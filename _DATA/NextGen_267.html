RIKER: Fletcher has more experience with propulsion systems. <br>
TROI: But Carstairs is better with people. Considering this is a
supervisory position, I'd go with her. <br>
RIKER: I guess you're right. Didn't we just do crew evaluation reports?
<br>
TROI: Three months ago. <br>
RIKER: It seems like three weeks. Why don't we just give everybody a
promotion and call it a night, Commander? <br>
TROI: Fine with me, Captain. <br>
RIKER: Could we have two coffees, please. <br>
(at another table, four young people hear Troi's laughter) <br>
LAVELLE: (red uniform) What could be so funny? What's so funny about
crew evaluations? <br>
OGAWA: Don't worry about it, Sam. <br>
SITO: (gold, Bajoran) Can't we just try and have a good time here? <br>
LAVELLE: How can I have a good time when my career's being decided
across the room? Come on. Think promotion. Promotion. Promotion. <br>
TAURIK: (a vulcan) You can't really believe that what you are doing
will influence the outcome of your evaluation. <br>
(actually, he will become Vaurik of Voyager) <br>
LAVELLE: Promotion. Promotion. Promotion. <br>
OGAWA: It's a time-honoured strategy, Taurik. <br>
SITO: The Vedeks of the Janalan order maintain a round the clock chant
for the benefit of the Bajoran people. <br>
TAURIK: Considering the history of your planet, that doesn't exactly
validate what he's doing. <br>
LAVELLE: Promote me, please, so I can make Lieutenant and have my own
room. <br>
TAURIK: If you're unhappy sharing quarters with me, then you should put
in for a new room assignment. Just in case you're not promoted. <br>
(the waiter brings coffee) <br>
RIKER: I've been thinking about who to promote to Ops. <br>
TROI: The new night duty officer? <br>
RIKER: Lavelle is an obvious candidate, but I'm also considering Ensign
Sito. <br>
TROI: Thank you. <br>
BEN: You're welcome. Are you sure about dessert? <br>
TROI: Yes. Don't tempt me. <br>
(the waiter goes to the other table) <br>
LAVELLE: So, are they working on crew evaluations? <br>
BEN: Yep. <br>
SITO: Who are they talking about? <br>
BEN: It's not my place to say. <br>
SITO: Come on, Ben. <br>
LAVELLE: Please. <br>
BEN: All right, but I'm not sure you two are going to like it.
Apparently, you two are up for the same job. </font></p>

RIKER: Fire phasers. <br>

SITO: I'm sorry, sir. When we changed course I had to re-lock phasers
before I could fire. <br>
RIKER: Next time, try letting the locking relay float until the actual
order to fire is given. They may not teach that trick at the Academy,
but it works. <br>
SITO: Thank you, sir. <br>
RIKER: Lavelle. <br>
LAVELLE: Sir? <br>
RIKER: Resume previous course and speed. <br>
LAVELLE: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
RIKER: One aye is sufficient acknowledgment, Ensign. <br>
(Picard enters) <br>
PICARD: Helm, change course for the Argaya system, maximum warp. <br>
LAVELLE: Aye, sir. <br>
RIKER: What happened to the rendezvous with the Clement? <br>
PICARD: I've just received new orders from Starfleet. We'll discuss it
in the Observation lounge. Mister Data, Mister Worf. <br>
RIKER: Ensign Sito, take over at Ops. <br>
SITO: Yes, sir. <br>
(Riker, Data, Worf and Picard leave) <br>
SITO: The Argaya system's close to the Cardassian border. I wonder why
we're going there. How'd you like to be a spider under that table? <br>
LAVELLE: What? <br>
SITO: A spider under the table. <br>
LAVELLE: Is that like a fly on the wall? <br>
SITO: I guess so. You did really well during the drill. <br>
LAVELLE: Well apparently Commander Riker didn't think so. I swear he's
got it in for me. <br>
SITO: You're imagining things. <br>
LAVELLE: Yeah? Then how come you're sitting in that chair instead of
me? <br>
SITO: I guess he figured I need more practice than you do.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TAURIK: Excuse me, sir. Do you have a minute? <br>
LAFORGE: Sure, Taurik. What is it? <br>
TAURIK: I'd like you to take a look at something. <br>
LAFORGE: Have you been improvising again, Ensign? <br>
TAURIK: In a manner of speaking. I'm running a computer simulation to
test a new warp field configuration. <br>
LAFORGE: You've got a problem here. Your plasma flow to the nacelles is
out of sync. <br>
TAURIK: Actually, sir, that was done deliberately. As you can see, this
configuration has increased overall warp field integrity by seven
percent. <br>
LAFORGE: You're right. <br>
TAURIK: Doctor Nils Diaz has been experimenting with this technique at
the Tanaline Propulsion Laboratory. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, I'm familiar with his work, but I never heard anything
about this. <br>
TAURIK: His findings have not been released yet. I was able to review a
preliminary report when I was at the Academy. <br>
LAFORGE: I look forward to reading about it <br>
TAURIK: I predict that when these findings are made public, they will
become a new model for warp field operation. <br>
LAFORGE: Sounds interesting. <br>
TAURIK: With your permission, sir, I'd like to begin tests to see if
the technique can be adapted to our warp drive. <br>
LAFORGE: There might be variables that you didn't account for. <br>
TAURIK: I was quite thorough. <br>
LAFORGE: I'm sure you were, but I'd still need to see your simulation
before I authorise any tests. <br>
TAURIK: As you wish. <br>
LAFORGE: If you have any other ideas for increasing efficiency, don't
hesitate to run them by me. <br>
TAURIK: As a matter of fact, sir, I do. When would be a good time to
discuss them? <br>

CRUSHER: If you're wondering about the evaluations, things couldn't be
better. <br>
OGAWA: Actually, I just wanted to tell you that Ensign Reilly's
condition is showing improvement. But thank you. <br>
CRUSHER: In fact, I'm recommending you for a promotion. How does
Lieutenant Alyssa Ogawa sound? <br>
OGAWA: It sounds wonderful. <br>
CRUSHER: I'll talk to Commander Riker and I'm sure it'll be official as
soon as the current crew evaluations are over. Oh, Alyssa, how are
things going between you and Lieutenant Powell? <br>
OGAWA: Fine. I think. <br>
CRUSHER: You think? <br>
OGAWA: I'm sure it's nothing, but he seems preoccupied lately. Last
night he had to cancel our date. <br>
CRUSHER: I see. <br>
OGAWA: He's been putting together a research proposal. He's been really
busy with it. <br>
CRUSHER: I know what that's like. Sometimes I get so busy with research
I forget to eat. <br>
OGAWA: I just wonder. <br>
CRUSHER: What? Sit down. <br>
OGAWA: I've never met anyone like Andrew. It's as though we've known
each other forever. <br>
CRUSHER: You do seem very well suited. <br>
OGAWA: But I know that in the beginning of a romance it's possible to
be a little blind. <br>
CRUSHER: I'm not sure I know what you mean. <br>
OGAWA: Well, cancelling a date like that, the way he's been so distant
lately. Doctor, do you think those could be warning signs that he's
losing interest? <br>
CRUSHER: Alyssa, I think you're overreacting. <br>
OGAWA: Maybe so. <br>
CRUSHER: If I cared as much about someone as much as you care about
Andrew, he'd have to do a lot more than cancel a date before I'd get
suspicious. <br>
OGAWA: You're right. <br>
CRUSHER: I'm sure that when this research is over, things will be back
just the way they were. <br>
OGAWA: Except, of course, that he'll have to deal with Lieutenant
Ogawa. </font></p>

SITO: I only filled in at Ops for a half hour, but I had to degauss the
main deflector dish, recalibrate the navigation grid, and use internal
sensors to find a lost puppy. <br>
WORF: Ops is a very different challenge from Tactical. <br>
SITO: I can't figure out why I'm even being considered for this
assignment. I'm a security officer. <br>
WORF: I recommended you. <br>
SITO: I'll try not to let you down, sir. <br>

be treated like a civilian. <br>
LAVELLE: Riker? I bet he sleeps in his uniform. <br>
BEN: You only think that because he's your CO. If you got to know him. <br>
LAVELLE: Right. <br>
TAURIK: He's convinced Commander Riker doesn't like him. <br>
BEN: Why? Did you crash the ship into something? <br>
LAVELLE: No. He just doesn't like me. <br>
