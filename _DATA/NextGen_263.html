returning from the Bat'leth competition on Forcas Three. The conditions
were difficult. Several contenders were maimed. But I was triumphant. I
won Champion Standing. I am looking forward to resuming my duties
aboard the Enterprise. However, I am anticipating a troubling
situation.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Worf keeps looking around for something) <br>
RIKER: It looks like we're going to have to head into to the Argus
Array. This is the third time this year it's stopped relaying data.
Starfleet's beginning to think it's more than a simple malfunction. I
want you to start a long range scan once we get. Lieutenant? Are you
listening to me? <br>
WORF: Hmm? Yes, sir. <br>
RIKER: You seem awfully tense for a man who just came back from
vacation. <br>
WORF: Today is my birthday.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: What's the matter with you? <br>
WORF: Because it is my birthday I assumed that you or one of the others
would try to mount an unexpected social gathering. <br>
RIKER: A surprise party? Mister Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would
never do that to you. <br>
WORF: I am sorry, Commander. <br>
RIKER: Settle in. I'll meet you on the Bridge. <br>
WORF: Aye sir. <br>
(Riker leaves, Worf puts down his bat'leth and trophy and walks through
to) <br>
ALL: Surprise!! <br>
(Riker returns and puts a twee party hat on Worf) <br>
RIKER: I love surprise parties. <br>
(after the opening titles, seventeen or so candles are lit on the
chocolate
cake, and to the tune of For He's A Jolly Good Fellow) <br>
ALL: Cha Worf Toh'gah nah lo Pre'tOk. Cha Worf Toh'gah nah lo Pre'tOk.
Cha Worf Toh'gah nah lo Pre'tOk. Tu Mak Dagh Cha doh Borak! <br>
(Worf blows out the candles) <br>
WORF: That was not a Klingon song. <br>
TROI: It wasn't easy to translate. There doesn't seem to be a Klingon
word for jolly. <br>
CRUSHER: It's traditional for the birthday boy to cut the cake. <br>
RIKER: Captain Picard sends his birthday wishes. He was needed on the
Bridge. <br>
(Worf cuts a huge slice of soft cake) <br>
DATA: Happy birthday, Worf. <br>
WORF: Thank you. <br>
(Worf opens the present) <br>
WORF: Ah. A painting. <br>
DATA: Yes. I have entered my Expressionistic phase. This is my
interpretation of the Battle of HarOS. <br>
WORF: The Battle of HarOS? <br>
TROI: I think it's wonderful. And I know just where to put it. <br>
WORF: What are you doing? <br>
(Riker takes down the brass shield, and Troi hangs the big bright
canvas to the left of the door) <br>
TROI: I always thought this room could use a little more colour. <br>
LAFORGE: Nice. The Battle of HarOS, right? <br>
(Worf sways) <br>
LAFORGE: Worf, are you all right? <br>
WORF: Yes, Yes, I think Data's painting is making me dizzy. <br>
CRUSHER: Some cake? <br>
LAFORGE: Thank you, Doctor. <br>
(the inside of the cake is yellow) <br>
WORF: I thought the cake was chocolate. <br>
TROI: Don't I wish. This is from Alexander. He gave it me just before
he left to visit your parents. (takes cake) Thank you. <br>
(Worf unwraps a plaster cast) <br>
LAFORGE: What is it, Worf? <br>
WORF: It is a cast of Alexander's forehead. The ridges of a warrior. <br>
TROI: He wished he could have been here when you got back from shore
leave. You should have seen him, Worf. He stayed up all night talking
about how proud he was of his father. <br>
WORF: Thank you for watching him while I was away. <br>
TROI: Oh, it was my pleasure. <br>
PICARD: So, how old are you, Mister Worf? <br>
WORF: Captain, I was told you could not attend. <br>
PICARD: (tucking into cake) I wouldn't miss this for the world. How old
are you? <br>
WORF: I am old enough.

PICARD: Report. <br>
DATA: The Array appears to be functioning normally, sir. <br>
RIKER: That can't be right. We were told the Array stopped relaying
data six days ago. <br>
DATA: The Array is still transmitting data, sir, but it is no longer
sending that information to the Federation. It appears someone has
redirected its imaging systems. <br>
PICARD: Where is the information being sent now? <br>
DATA: Sector one nine six five eight, sir. I am unable to access it's
main computer, so it is impossible to determine the exact location. <br>
RIKER: What's in that sector? <br>
WORF: It is uninhabited. But there could be a ship or a subspace relay
station receiving the data. <br>
RIKER: Captain. I suggest we beam a repair crew aboard the Array. We
can begin downloading their imaging logs, find out what the Array's
been observing for the past six days. <br>
PICARD: Make it so. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: Excuse me, Counsellor. Do you have a moment? <br>
TROI: Of course. <br>
WORF: I have been meaning to speak with you about Alexander. <br>
TROI: Oh? <br>
WORF: It has never been easy for me having Alexander on board. I have
always tried to be a good father, to give him guidance, but he seems to
have his own mind about some things. <br>
TROI: Most children do. <br>
WORF: I could not have come this far without your help. Alexander looks
up to you. At times, I have felt that you are like a mother to him. <br>
TROI: Worf, that's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me. <br>
WORF: One time when I thought I was going to die, I asked you to watch
over Alexander. I was wondering if you might consider formalising that
arrangement. I want you to be Alexander's Soh-chIm. <br>
TROI: His Soh-chIm? <br>
WORF: You would become his surrogate mother. In case anything ever
happened to me, you would be responsible for him. <br>
TROI: I don't know what to say. It's a great honour. So, that would
make me your? <br>
WORF: The closest analogy is step-sister. <br>
TROI: That would make my mother your step-mother. <br>
WORF: I had not considered that. It is a risk I am willing to take. <br>
TROI: I accept. <br>
DATA [OC]: Lieutenant Worf, please report to Engineering. <br>
WORF: I am on my way.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: We have analysed the imaging logs. It appears
the Array was reprogrammed to observe several Federation sites. <br>
LAFORGE: This is Deep Space Five. Starbase Forty seven. The Iadara
Colony and the Utopia Planitia Shipyards. <br>
PICARD: They're responsible for new starship development. <br>
WORF: Someone is using the Array for covert surveillance of the
Federation. <br>
DATA: That is our theory. We believe unauthorised access was made six
days ago. The imaging logs from that day show a ship approaching the
Array. <br>
WORF: That's a Cardassian ship. Galor Class. <br>
LAFORGE: We're only three light years from Cardassian space. They would
have easy access to the Array. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, start a long range scan of the region. See if
there are any Cardassian ships nearby. <br>
WORF: Aye sir. <br>
LAFORGE: Worf, here's a propulsion analysis of the Cardassian ship. You
might try scanning for its energy configuration. <br>
(Worf has a dizzy moment and Data supports him) <br>
DATA: Lieutenant, are you all right? <br>
WORF: I feel dizzy. <br>
(it's now Geordi supporting the swaying Worf. Picard is missing) <br>
LAFORGE: Worf, you don't look so good. Maybe you ought to go to
Sickbay. <br>
WORF: Yes. Yes, perhaps I will.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: Any nausea or blurred vision? <br>
WORF: No. However, I did experience some dizziness earlier today at my
birthday celebration. <br>
CRUSHER: Sounds like you're having some of the side effects from the
concussion. I can give you some vertazine for the dizziness but I'd
like you to rest. <br>
WORF: Doctor, perhaps you are thinking of another patient. I have no
concussion. <br>
CRUSHER: Worf, you came in here this morning complaining of ringing in
your ears. I scanned you. You had a concussion. You don't remember any
of this? <br>
WORF: No. <br>
CRUSHER: Temporary memory loss is common for this kind of injury. Do
you remember telling me about the Bat'leth tournament? You said that
one of the competitors hit you over the head. That's why you lost the
match. <br>
WORF: I won that tournament. And I can prove it to you.

CRUSHER: What's wrong? <br>
WORF: It says ninth place. This is not the same trophy. Someone is
playing a trick on me. <br>
CRUSHER: Worf, try to stay calm. Memory loss can be very disorienting. <br>
WORF: The log. I recorded a personal log on my way back to the
Enterprise. Computer, access personal logs on Shuttlecraft Curie. Show
my log entry for Stardate 47391.2. <br>
WORF [on monitor]: Personal log, stardate 47391.2. I am returning from
the Bat'leth competition on Forcas Three. The conditions were
difficult. Several contenders were maimed. One of the contenders used
an illegal T'gha manoeuvre against me. The judges chose to ignore it
and I was robbed of my rightful standing. I was awarded ninth place. I
am looking forward to resuming my duties aboard the En <br>
WORF: I do not understand. <br>
CRUSHER: Worf, I'm sure this is very disturbing for you, but don't
worry, your memories will return. The best thing you could do right now
is to settle back into your normal routine, but slowly. <br>
WORF: Thank you, Doctor. <br>
CRUSHER: Let me know if you have any more problems with dizziness. I'll
give you a hypospray.

metallurgical scan of the Array? <br>
WORF: Sir? <br>
DATA: The metallurgical scan. Have you completed it? <br>
WORF: I do not remember you asking me to. Captain, there is a
Cardassian ship approaching. Galor Class. <br>
PICARD: Open a channel. <br>
WORF: On screen. <br>
PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise. You
are in Federation territory. Please explain your presence here. <br>
NADOR [on viewscreen]: We were wondering the same thing about you,
Captain. Why would Starfleet's flagship want to venture so close to the
Cardassian border? <br>
PICARD: We are repairing one of our subspace telescopes. <br>
NADOR [on viewscreen]: I see. May we offer our assistance? <br>
PICARD: No, thank you. Everything is under control. <br>
NADOR [on viewscreen]: If you don't mind my asking, what exactly is
this telescope of yours designed to do? <br>
PICARD: It's a long range subspace Array. We use it for gathering data
on astronomical phenomena. <br>
NADOR [on viewscreen]: I'm certain it would never be used to observe a
neighbouring species. <br>
PICARD: Certainly not. <br>
NADOR [on viewscreen]: Well then, best of luck with your repairs. Just
try to make certain that your studies are limited to astronomical
phenomena. <br>
(transmission ends) <br>
RIKER: Charming fellow. <br>
WORF: Captain, that ship was responsible for reprogramming the Array. <br>
PICARD: What are you saying? <br>
WORF: It is the same class and energy configuration as the ship we saw
in the imaging logs. <br>
PICARD: The imaging logs? Are you suggesting that you have evidence the
Cardassians have tampered with the Array? <br>
WORF: They are using the Array as a surveillance device. You saw the
logs yourself. <br>
PICARD: I haven't heard anything about this. <br>
RIKER: Neither have I. <br>
WORF: Commander Data, show them the logs you downloaded from the Array.
<br>
DATA: I know of no such logs. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, are you feeling all right? <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, perhaps you had better re-examine the Array. See
if you can find any evidence to support Mister Worf's claims. </font></p>

for a second you're right, that things did happen as you remember them.

DATA: It is my understanding your romantic affiliation began shortly
after you recovered from your spinal injury on stardate 45587. It was
six months later that you asked Commander Riker for his formal
permission to court Counsellor Troi. You felt to do otherwise would be
dishonourable. <br>

do not remember that happening. <br>

WORF: Before. Yes. Yes, I was in Engineering. I felt a wave of
dizziness and when I looked up, you and Commander La Forge were on the
opposite side of the room. Captain Picard was gone. I thought I had
blacked out for a moment and had not observed your movements. And at my
birthday party, the cake was chocolate and then it was yellow. And
Commander Riker told me Captain Picard was not going to attend, and
then suddenly he was there. <br>
DATA: We should try to find the commonalties in these events. Where
were the people you were with? <br>
WORF: Everyone was at my birthday party. Then I was with Counsellor
Troi, then Commander La Forge came in. Geordi. Geordi was present at
all three locations. And he was near me in each case just before I

the subatomic level. It is asynchronous with normal matter. In essence,
Captain, Mister Worf does not belong in our universe. <br>

DATA: All matter in the universe resonates on a quantum level with a
unique signature. That signature is constant. It cannot be changed
through any known process. It is the basic foundation of existence. <br>

ours? <br>

different quantum universe. <br>

you returned from a Bat'leth tournament on Forcas Three. <br>

RIKER: Now, I know for a fact that you never attended that tournament
and that no shuttlecraft has left the Enterprise for over a month. <br>

tournament and returning to the ship in a shuttlecraft. <br>

intersecting the phenomenon. I believe it was left by a Starfleet type
six shuttlecraft. <br>
WORF: So I was here. <br>
DATA: I have an explanation, sir.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Observation lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: I believe the quantum fissure we discovered
is a fixed point across the space time continuum. A keyhole which
intersects many other quantum realities. <br>
TROI: What do you mean, quantum realities? <br>
DATA: For any event, there is an infinite number of possible outcomes.
Our choices determine which outcomes will follow. But there is a theory
in quantum physics that all possibilities that can happen, do happen in
alternate quantum realities. <br>
WORF: And somehow I have been shifting from one reality to another. <br>
DATA: That is correct. <br>
TROI: How did this happen? <br>
DATA: When Worf's shuttlecraft came into contact with the quantum
fissure, I believe its warp engines caused a small break in the
barriers between quantum realties. Worf was thrown into a state of
quantum flux. He immediately shifted into other realities. <br>
CRUSHER: And Geordi's visor somehow triggered that effect? <br>
DATA: Exactly. The visor uses a subspace field pulse. I believe that
whenever Geordi came near Worf, the field pulse intensified the quantum
flux and pushed Worf into another reality. <br>
WORF: How can we find my original quantum state and return me to it? <br>
WESLEY: We could scan the quantum fissure using a subspace differential
pulse. Maybe we could locate the quantum state that shares Worf's
signature and find a way to get him back. <br>
DATA: An excellent idea, Lieutenant. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(the impressionist painting is back in place) <br>
TROI: Worf. From what I understand, there's a good chance my Worf won't
return. I guess it's just hard for me to accept that there's a reality
out there where you never loved me. <br>
WORF: Deanna, I have always considered you a close friend. And although
I have never seriously considered a romantic relationship, I would not
be opposed to the possibility. <br>
TROI: What about our children? <br>
WORF: Children? <br>
TROI: You didn't know? <br>
WORF: When the last shift occurred in Sickbay, we did not have any
children. <br>
TROI: We have a little girl, Shannara, she's two years old, and a three
year old boy, Eric Christopher. <br>
WORF: What about Alexander? <br>
TROI: Alexander? <br>
WORF: He was my son in another reality.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WESLEY: I've used a differential pulse to analyze
over ten million quantum states within the fissure, but I still haven't
found one with your signature. This may take some time, sir. <br>
DATA: Captain, a Bajoran ship is approaching. <br>
RIKER: Red Alert. <br>
WORF: Sir, the Bajorans? <br>
TROI: Ever since the Bajorans overpowered the Cardassian Empire,
they've become more and more aggressive. <br>
RIKER: Yesterday they destroyed one of our subspace telescopes because
they thought we were using it to spy on them. <br>
WESLEY: They're charging their weapons, sir. <br>
WORF: Shields! <br>
RIKER: Return fire. <br>
WESLEY: They've damaged our power systems, sir. It's caused an energy
surge within the subspace pulse. The quantum fissure is beginning to
destabilise. <br>
RIKER: Can we disengage the pulse? <br>
WESLEY: Too late, sir. <br>
(the fissure goes rainbow, then more Enterprises pop into this
existence) <br>
RIKER: What the hell is happening? <br>
DATA: The barriers between quantum realties are breaking down. Other
realties are emerging into our own. <br>
(<i>'and thick and fast they came at last, and more, and more,
and more'</i>) <br>
WESLEY: The Bajoran ship is disengaging, sir. <br>
DATA: The rate of quantum incursions is increasing exponentially. At
this rate, the sector will be completely filled with Enterprises within
three days. <br>
WESLEY: Captain, we're receiving two hundred eighty five thousand
hails. <br>
RIKER: I wish I knew what to tell them. Mister Data, can we stop these
incursions? <br>
DATA: Perhaps, if we can find the ship which that Commander Worf's
quantum signature. <br>
RIKER: How would that help? <br>
DATA: It was Worf's shuttlecraft which traversed the fissure and
weakened the barriers between quantum realities. If he re-enters the
fissure in his original shuttle, and emits a broad spectrum warp field,
it may be enough to seal the fissure and stop additional realities from
emerging into our own. <br>
RIKER: What then? How do we get the Enterprises that are already here
back to where they belong? <br>
DATA: In theory, the act of sealing the fissure should restore the
barriers between quantum states. The ships would return to their own
realities. <br>
RIKER: Lieutenant Crusher, send a general hail, all ships. <br>
WESLEY: Aye, sir. <br>
RIKER: This is Captain Riker of the Enterprise. That is, the Enterprise
which is indigenous to this universe. We've all encountered a quantum
anomaly. We think we have found a way to return all of us to our proper
realities, but we need to find that ship which exhibits a certain
quantum signature. Our Mister Data will transmit that signature to you
now. <br>
(a not too brief pause) <br>
RIKER: Anything? <br>
WESLEY: There's too much comm. traffic, sir. It's tough to isolate
who's talking to who. Wait a minute. Here it is. Someone's responding. <br>
RIKER: On screen. <br>
PICARD [on viewscreen]: Captain, it would that we have found the
quantum signature you are looking for. <br>
RIKER: Data believes that by sending Worf back through the fissure
again, it would return us all to our proper realities. <br>
PICARD [on viewscreen]: Our Data has said the same thing. <br>
RIKER: We need you to send us your shuttlecraft Curie. <br>
PICARD [on viewscreen]: We're launching it now. <br>
RIKER: Thank you. It's good to see you again, Captain. It's been a long
time. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Did they send the right shuttle? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. It matches Commander Worf's quantum signature
precisely. I have remodulated the shuttle's engines to emit an inverse
warp field. You will need to activate the field at the precise moment
you enter the fissure. <br>
WORF: Assuming it works, will I find myself near my own ship? <br>
DATA: That is one possibility. However, the uncertainty principle
dictates that time is a variable in this equation. You may end up
several days before the event or several days after. There is no way to
tell. <br>
WORF: I understand. <br>
RIKER: Good luck. <br>

RIKER [on viewscreen]: We won't go back. You don't know what it's like
in our universe. The Federation's gone, the Borg is everywhere! We're
one of the last ships left. Please, you've got to help us! <br>

WESLEY: Sir, they're firing on the shuttlecraft. <br>
RIKER: Open fire. Try to disable them. <br>
WESLEY: Direct hit. Their shields have collapsed. Their engine core is
overloading. <br>
(KaBOOM) <br>
RIKER: What happened? <br>
WESLEY: It looks like the ship had already taken heavy damage. Their
warp containment field must have been weak. <br>
RIKER: Probably from fighting with the Borg. <br>
