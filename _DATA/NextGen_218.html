remember giving you a hypospray for dizziness. <br>

thinking about another patient. <br>

CRUSHER: Yes. Captain, have you been getting the feeling that you've
experienced certain things before? A sense of repetition? <br>
PICARD: Yes, recently. While I was reading. Why do you ask? <br>
CRUSHER: There have been similar incidents reported all over the ship.
Feelings of
déjà vu. I had a premonition Geordi was going to come in to Sickbay. A
few seconds later he did, with the symptoms of an ear infection. I was
going to run the standard tests, but somehow I had a feeling they would
turn out negative. So I ran an optical diagnostic which traced the
problem to Geordi's visor. His dizziness is being caused by a phase
shift in his visual receptors. It's causing him to see images that
aren't there. <br>
LAFORGE: They're like blurry after-images. <br>
CRUSHER: I ran a scan to see if I could detect what he was seeing. I
picked up miniscule distortions in the surrounding dekyon field.
Somehow, his visor is translating those distortions into visual
impulses. <br>
LAFORGE: It could be a malfunction in the ship's warp field generator.
I'll check it out. <br>
PICARD: Run a localised subspace scan to look for anything else. <br>

energy does not correspond to any ship's system, nor to any voice
communications sent at the time you heard it. <br>

LAFORGE: You heard the voices at the same time our localised subspace

give another listen. <br>
DATA: Computer, perform a narrow bandwidth analysis. Eliminate all
non-vocal waveform components. <br>

thousand voices overlapping. The voices are those of the Enterprise

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: I'm sorry to call you here so early, but
we couldn't wait until oh seven hundred hours. We think we may have an
explanation for the odd occurrences around here. Commander. <br>
LAFORGE: This is going to sound pretty wild. Somehow, we've entered
what seems to be a temporal causality loop. We think we're stuck in a
particular fragment in time, and we've been repeating that same
fragment over and over again. <br>
TROI: Is this what's causing our déjà vu? <br>
CRUSHER: Yes, but it's more than that. In déjà vu, you only think
you're repeating events. We actually are. <br>
LAFORGE: Our theory is this. Every time the loop begins again,
everything resets itself, and starts all over. We don't remember
anything that happened before, so each time through the loop, we think
it's the first. <br>
RIKER: You mean we could have come into this room, sat at this table
and had this conversation a dozen times already? <br>
LAFORGE: A dozen, a hundred, it's impossible to tell. We could have
been trapped here for hours, days, maybe years. <br>
CRUSHER: If what we're saying is true, those voices I heard might have
been echoes from previous loops. <br>
LAFORGE: It's the same thing with the phase shift in my visor.
After-images in time. <br>
PICARD: If you're right about this, how did it happen? How did we get
there? <br>
DATA: I have a hypothesis that may explain that, Captain. I have
analysed the recording Doctor Crusher made. Most of it is quite
ordinary. One hundred fifty discussions about ship operations, two
hundred fifty two conversations of a personal nature, five couples
engaged in romantic encounters. <br>
PICARD: Your point, Mister Data? <br>
DATA: There is evidence of some sort of disaster aboard the Enterprise,
severe enough that the Captain ordered all hands to abandon ship. I
have isolated three segments of the recording that are crucial. <br>
WORF [OC]: A highly localised distortion of the space-time continuum. <br>
DATA [OC]: Collision course. Impact in thirty six seconds. <br>
PICARD [OC]: All hands, abandon ship! Repeat, all hands abandon <br>
LAFORGE: Worf refers to a distortion. If this were a temporal
distortion, and if we were close enough to it, it's possible that a
large enough explosion might've ruptured the space-time continuum. We
collided, exploded, then got stuck in this repeating loop of time. <br>
PICARD: If you're right, perhaps we could escape the loop by avoiding
the collision. <br>
LAFORGE: That's our guess. <br>
WORF: Maybe we should reverse course. <br>
RIKER: For all we know, reversing course may be what leads us into the
crash. <br>
PICARD: No. We can't afford to start second guessing ourselves. We'll
stay on this course until we have reason to change it. But let's do
everything we can to avoid the collision. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, we might not be able to figure out how to avoid this
accident until it's too late. And if the loop begins again, we'll
forget everything we've learned this time around. <br>
PICARD: What do you suggest? <br>
LAFORGE: If we do find a way to avoid this collision, we should try to
send that information into the next loop. <br>
RIKER: Is that possible? <br>
DATA: We have seen that echoes, or after-images, from previous loops
appear as distortions in the dekyon field. We may be able to send a
deliberate echo into the next loop. <br>
TROI: Like a message in a bottle. <br>
LAFORGE: Exactly. We could enhance a dekyon emission to create a
specific pattern and send ourselves a message. Not a long
one, probably only a few characters. Maybe one word. <br>
RIKER: How do we know we'll pick up that word the next time through? <br>
DATA: If the dekyon emission is modulated correctly, it will set up

whatever steps are necessary to send a message. Dismissed.

several times for headaches related to your visor but there's no
mention of dizziness. <br>

picked up miniscule distortions in the surrounding dekyon field. His

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: I have isolated three segments of this
recording that are crucial. <br>
WORF [OC]: A highly localised distortion of the space-time continuum. <br>
DATA [OC]: Collision course. Impact in thirty six seconds. <br>
PICARD [OC]: All hands, abandon ship! Repeat, all hands abandon <br>
LAFORGE: Worf refers to a distortion. If this were a temporal
distortion, and if we were close enough to it, it's possible that a
large enough explosion might've ruptured the space time continuum. We
collided, exploded, then got stuck in this repeating loop of time. <br>
PICARD: If you're right about this then perhaps we can escape the loop
by avoiding the collision. <br>
LAFORGE: That's our guess. <br>
WORF: Perhaps we should reverse course. <br>
RIKER: For all we know, reversing course might be what leads us into
the crash. <br>
PICARD: We can't afford to start second guessing ourselves. We should
stay on this course until we have reason to change it. But in the
meantime, I think we should do what we can to avoid a collision. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain. We've been seeing the number three all over the ship.
On consoles, in a poker game. <br>
DATA: To date we have encountered two thousand eighty five conspicuous
examples of the number three. <br>
LAFORGE: All of these threes can't be coming up by accident. <br>
CRUSHER: Maybe somebody's trying to tell us something. <br>
LAFORGE: We came to the same conclusion so we ran a shipwide
diagnostic. The only unusual thing we found was a dekyon field
modulation in Data's positronic subprocessors. <br>
RIKER: What could be causing it? <br>
LAFORGE: I don't know, but if I wanted to send information from one
loop to the next I might use a method like a dekyon emission. <br>
TROI: You think we sent ourselves a message? <br>
LAFORGE: It would make sense. Maybe we are trying to tell ourselves
something. <br>
PICARD: If that were true, what could three indicate? <br>
RIKER: Maybe we should run a level three diagnostic on all key systems.
<br>
LAFORGE: It's a good idea. I'll have the computer run a pattern
matching algorithm based on the number three. <br>

number of rank insignia on Commander Riker's uniform.
That indicated to me that his suggestion might be the correct course of
action. <br>
LAFORGE: Data, you must have picked up a message we sent from the last
loop, and stacked the deck in the poker game without realising it. <br>
DATA: That is possible. I may also have been inadvertently responsible
for the unexplained appearances of the number three. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, end Red alert. And try to access a Federation time
base beacon. Let's see if we can find out how long we've been in this
causality loop. <br>
WORF: Time base confirms our chronometers are off by seventeen point
four days. <br>
PICARD: Reset them, Mister Data. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
WORF: Captain, we are being hailed by the other vessel. The computer
identifies it as the USS Bozeman, a Federation starship, Soyuz class. <br>

years. <br>

BATESON [on viewscreen]: This is Captain Morgan Bateson of the
Federation Starship Bozeman. Can we render assistance? <br>

Enterprise. We were just going to ask you the same thing. <br>
BATESON [on viewscreen]: Captain Picard, your vessel is not familiar to
us. <br>

BATESON [on viewscreen]: Our sensors detected a temporal distortion.
Then your ship appeared. We nearly hit you. <br>
PICARD: The Enterprise has been caught in temporal causality loop, and
I suspect that something similar may have happened to you. <br>
BATESON [on viewscreen]: You must be mistaken. We left starbase only
three weeks ago. <br>
