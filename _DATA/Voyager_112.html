a stormy night, of course.) <br>
TEMPLETON [OC]: The drawing room is in here. <br>
(A housemaid opens the door and the efficient housekeeper enters,
followed by Janeway in corset and crinoline.)<br>
TEMPLETON: Bridget, take Mrs Davenport's cape, and tell Lord Burleigh
that she's here.<br>
BRIDGET: Yes, ma'am.<br>
TEMPLETON: There's tea.<br>
(Bridget leaves.) <br>
JANEWAY: That would be lovely. Thank you.<br>
TEMPLETON: Tea is usually served at five thirty and dinner's at eight
thirty. His lordship doesn't appreciate being kept waiting.<br>
JANEWAY: I'll be sure to be prompt.<br>
TEMPLETON: Let's make something clear, Mrs Davenport. My job is to make
sure that this household runs smoothly. I have been with Lord Burleigh
for nearly twenty years because this household runs smoothly. He has
come to trust me, and I will not brook any behaviour that might
jeopardise that trust, so you will be expected to follow the rules that
I have set down.<br>
JANEWAY: Mrs Templeton, I have no wish to do anything that might
disrupt this household but let me make something perfectly clear. I've
been hired by Lord Burleigh, and it's his orders I will follow, not
yours.<br>
TEMPLETON: You would be wise not to make an enemy of me. I can make
sure we have another governess by next week.<br>
JANEWAY: I suggest we try to get along, Mrs Templeton. Surely there's
room here for both of us?<br>
TEMPLETON: One lump or two?<br>
JANEWAY: Two, please.<br>
TEMPLETON: Lord Burleigh will be here directly.<br>
(Mrs Templeton leaves Janeway to look around. She goes to close a
window flapping in the storm and sees a reflection in the glass.
Janeway turns to gaze at a portrait of a woman. Someone puts a hand on
her shoulder and she jumps.) <br>
BURLEIGH: Forgive me. I've startled you.<br>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry. I didn't here you come in.<br>
BURLEIGH: Mrs Davenport, I'll come to the point. I am not an easy man
to live with. Since my wife died I'm told I'm even worse. She was a
buffer for me.<br>
JANEWAY: I understand.<br>
BURLEIGH: The children are the ones who've suffered. I've not been much
of a father to them, and God knows I can't be a mother. I'm not asking
that you replace their mother, but I think that they'll respond to a
woman's sensibilities. You might fill a void in their lives.<br>
JANEWAY: I'll certainly try, your Grace.<br>
BURLEIGH: Young Henry is sometimes a bit stubborn and little Beatrice
misses her mother terribly. I hope they won't make things difficult for
you. One thing above all I must demand. You are never, under any
circumstances, to go onto the fourth floor. Is that clear?<br>
KIM: [OC]: Bridge to Captain Janeway.<br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
Mister Tuvok's shuttlecraft on long range sensors, but they're not
responding to our hails. The shuttle's been badly damaged. I'm reading
multiple hull fractures.<br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Life signs?<br>
KIM: Two, but they're very faint.<br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Beam them to Sickbay as soon as they're in range. I'm on
my way.<br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Tuvok
is unconscious on a biobed.) <br>
JANEWAY: Doctor. <br>
EMH: They've each taken a blast to the head by some kind of energy
discharge. Cardiostimulator. Mister Tuvok has a serious concussion, but
it's nothing I can't handle. As for Commander Chakotay, all of the
bioneural energy has been extracted from his brain.<br>
JANEWAY: Extracted?<br>
EMH: Yes. From the looks of it, someone drained the energy from every
single axon and dendrite right down to the synapses. I can keep his
heart beating and I can keep him breathing, but other than that there's
nothing I can do. He's brain dead.<br>
(Later, Tuvok is awake.) <br>
TUVOK: The attack lasted no more than a few seconds, but it was highly
effective. I feel Commander Chakotay and I are fortunate to be alive.<br>
JANEWAY: What happened, Lieutenant?<br>
TUVOK: We had completed our trade mission with the Ilidarians and were
on course to the rendezvous point when we encountered a dark matter
nebula. As we began a routine analysis, an unidentified ship emerged
and attacked our shuttle.<br>
JANEWAY: Any idea why?<br>
TUVOK: No. They would not respond to our hails. We were hit by an
energy discharge which penetrated our shields and filled the cabin.
Commander Chakotay lost consciousness immediately, and I was barely
able to activate the autopilot before I was overcome as well.<br>
JANEWAY: And the alien ship?<br>
TUVOK: The last image I saw was the ship flying back into the nebula,
but the details are difficult to remember.<br>
EMH: Can you tell me anything about the energy discharge? Its
modulation or phase distribution?<br>
TUVOK: No. There was no time for a detailed analysis. However, the
shuttle's sensors may have recorded information that could be helpful.
I will download the sensor logs.<br>
JANEWAY: Why would someone want to extract his bioneural energy?<br>
EMH: I don't know, but if I'm to have any hope of reviving him, I must
know precisely how his neurons were depleted. It would be a great help
if I could examine the weapon.<br>
JANEWAY: We're going back to that nebula to try to find the ship that
attacked you. Janeway to Bridge. Prepare to lay in a new course. Mister
Tuvok will provide you with the coordinates.<br>
PARIS [OC]: Aye, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: We'll keep you posted, Doctor. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
The energy discharge overloaded the shuttlecraft's central computer
core. All sensor data have been erased.<br>
JANEWAY: Lieutenant Torres is in Sickbay now. When she reports, tell
her to go over those damaged sensor logs with a fine tooth comb to see
if she can reconstruct any of the data.<br>
TUVOK: Aye, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Well, this is going to make things a little more difficult.
I've been using the long range sensors to analyze the nebula you
discovered. It's sending out strong electromagnetic radiation. We won't
be able to scan inside it. You know, it sounds to me like a perfect
hiding place.<br>
TUVOK: I agree.<br>
JANEWAY: I don't like the idea of going in there blind. Let me see if I
can reconfigure the sensors to a multiphasic bandwidth.<br>
TUVOK: Is there a problem?<br>
JANEWAY: I've lost all sensor contact with the nebula. I don't
understand. Wait a minute, we've altered course. Mister Paris?<br>
PARIS: Our new heading is one twenty one mark six. We've completely
come about, Captain, but it wasn't me.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Kim, check the navigational computer. Who ordered the
course change?<br>
KIM: According to my readings, the command was issued from the conn.<br>
PARIS: I'm telling you, it wasn't me, and the helm controls are working
perfectly. No sign of a malfunction.<br>
JANEWAY: Ensign, transfer helm control to your station and reset our
original course.<br>
KIM: Course laid in.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Paris, I want you to run a full diagnostic on the conn
station. See if you can isolate the problem.<br>
PARIS: Aye, Captain. </font></p>

holds a carved stone to Chakotay's head then places it on a skin held
in a frame. The skin is painted with an eight pointed star and various
Mesoamerican pictograms. The stone sticks.) <br>
EMH: You might have asked before adorning my Sickbay with animal
remains.<br>
TORRES: It's a medicine wheel, a talisman used by Chakotay's tribe. He
once showed me how it works. He said if anything ever happened to him,
that I should perform a special healing ritual.<br>
EMH: Ah.<br>
TORRES: The wheel represents both the universe outside and the universe
inside our minds as well. They believe each is a reflection of the
other. When a person is sleeping, or on a vision quest, it's said that
his soul is walking the wheel. But if he's in a coma or near death, it
means that he's gotten lost. These stones are signposts to help point
the way back. Not exactly standard medical procedure, I know, but <br>
EMH: You've placed the Coyote Stone at the crossroads of the fifth and
sixth realms, which would divert Commander Chakotay's soul, that is his
consciousness, into the Mountains of the Antelope Women. According to
his tradition, an extremely attractive locale. He might not want to
leave.<br>
TORRES: How do you know about the medicine wheel?<br>
EMH: It's my business to know about a variety of medical treatments,
including those based on psycho-spiritual beliefs. Unfortunately, in
this case, the medicine wheel won't be much help. There's just not
enough of his mind left to work with.<br>
(The EMH leaves Torres to put the Coyote stone somewhere else.) <br>

KES: It's not the same. That was like, like hearing faint music from a
faraway place. When I was in my quarters just now <br>
NEELIX: Mmm hmm?<br>

Lieutenant Paris was in there just a few minutes ago.<br>

JANEWAY: Janeway out. Explanation, Mister Paris? <br>
PARIS: I passed by the navigational control on my way back from the
Jefferies tube, but that's all. Am I being accused of something here?<br>
TUVOK: We are merely following a line of deductive reasoning,
Lieutenant. Both deviations from our course were apparently issued from
locations where you were working.<br>
PARIS: I'm telling you, I didn't do it. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, I'm willing to rule out mutiny for time being. I believe
you, Mister Paris, but we have to consider the possibility that you
might be having a problem with your memory. I want you to go down to

PARIS: Doc Brown. Lollipops in the waiting room, no holocomic books
more than six months old, house calls. I caught a bad cold one time
when I was nine years old. The doctor whipped up a pot of garlic soup
and brought it over himself.<br>

TUVOK: Your report, Doctor?<br>
EMH: I still have a series of tests to perform, but other than his
irritating lapses into nostalgia, I see nothing wrong with him.<br>
PARIS: I guess you're going to have to round up another suspect, Tuvok.<br>
TUVOK: On the contrary, Lieutenant. I ran a forensic sweep of the
navigational control. I found traces of your DNA on the console.<br>
PARIS: That's impossible.<br>
TUVOK: The cellular residue you left behind is less than twelve hours
old. Do you still wish to maintain your innocence?<br>

erratic.<br>
JANEWAY: These planetoids inside the nebula, they may be generating a
dangerous gravitational effect, like storm currents. Chances are
they've mapped those currents and they're taking the only safe way
through.<br>

JANEWAY: You've initiated an emergency warp core shutdown.<br>
TORRES: What?<br>
JANEWAY: Too late. The warp core is offline. It'll take at least two
hours to regenerate the dilithium matrix. Ensign, get the rest of the
systems back online. Apparently, you've just crashed the main computer,
locked out the Bridge and stopped this ship cold. Do you want to tell
me why?<br>

JANEWAY: What the hell is going on here? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH: I
found something, and you're not going to like it. This is Mister Paris'
memory engram for the last twenty four hours. As you can see, it has a
very consistent and distinctive modulation, except at thirteen fifty
hours. For one minute forty seven seconds, a different memory pattern
appeared. Thirteen fifty hours is also the exact moment when Mister
Paris presumably tampered with navigational control. It gets worse. In
addition to that, there is another disruption at twelve oh two hours,
the moment when he allegedly entered the new course at the helm. I also
found there's an identical disruption in Lieutenant Torres's pattern at
the moment she shut down warp power. I should point out that this is a
neuroelectrical signature, what I believe to be another brain wave that
was superimposed on their own.<br>
PARIS: Another brain wave? Whose?<br>
EMH: I don't know. It has an unusual energy signature, one I've never
seen before.<br>
JANEWAY: Doctor, what are you saying?<br>
EMH: One possible explanation, and the only one I can think of at the
moment, is that an unknown alien entity momentarily took control of
their minds.<br>
TUVOK: Intruder alert. All security personnel, go to Condition Four.
Captain, it is possible the intruder returned with us in the
shuttlecraft.<br>
JANEWAY: If we're right and there is an alien here, it seems intent on
preventing us from going back to the nebula. What's more, it seems to
have the ability to jump from person to person. If that's true, it
could be in any one of us, controlling our actions without us realising
it.<br>
EMH: Well, except for me.<br>
PARIS: That's true. So far it's only affected organic beings. If it
could control the computer and navigational systems directly, it
probably would've done it already.<br>
JANEWAY: Which means the doctor is the only person on board we can
trust at this moment. Doctor, until we have eliminated this alien
presence, I can't take the risk that it could take over any of the
senior officers. I'd like to transfer all command codes to you until
further notice.<br>
EMH: What would that mean? That I am in command?<br>
JANEWAY: No, but you will act as a failsafe. If you feel at any time
that any one of us are under the influence of the alien, you can
countermand our orders and take control of the ship. Do you feel up to
it?<br>
EMH: Well, of course. I make life and death decisions every day.<br>
PARIS: I feel better already.<br>
JANEWAY: Computer, transfer all command codes to the holographic
doctor. Authorisation Janeway eight four one alpha six five.<br>
COMPUTER: Command code transfer complete.<br>

schedule.<br>
TORRES: Aye, Captain. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KES:
Captain, I heard what's happened. I think you're right. There is an
alien presence here, I've been sensing something unusual all day. I
don't know how to describe it, but I know there's something here.<br>
(The thing flies along the corridor.) <br>
JANEWAY: Do you know where?<br>
KES: No, just that it's on the ship.<br>
TUVOK: Captain, Kes's telepathic abilities are undisciplined. If I
could initiate a Vulcan mind-meld with her, I may be able to help her
focus those abilities to detect the alien more accurately.<br>
KES: I'm willing to do that.<br>
JANEWAY: Very well. Proceed, Mister Tuvok. <br>
(Elsewhere.) <br>
KIM: The captain wants to seal off all critical areas of the ship. Make
sure the access hatch of Jefferies tube A-seventeen is secured.<br>
DURST: So what exactly are we securing against?<br>
KIM: We're not sure yet, but we think it's some kind of noncorporeal
alien.<br>
DURST: Noncorporeal? That means it can probably move through a bulk <br>

KIM: Medical emergency. Deck seven, section thirteen alpha. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
Captain's log, supplemental. It appears that Mister Tuvok and Kes were
both hit by an unidentified energy discharge. Tuvok was not badly hurt,
but Kes is in a coma. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Briefing
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
It was similar to the attack on the shuttlecraft. An energy discharge
came through the bulkhead, filled the turbolift and hit both of us.<br>
TORRES: We didn't pick up a discharge of any kind on the internal
sensors.<br>
TUVOK: Perhaps this type of energy is beyond our sensor bandwidth.<br>
JANEWAY: Perhaps, but that discharge had to come from somewhere.<br>
PARIS: The most thorough scanning device we have on board is a magneton
scanner. We could search the ship centimetre by centimetre, but that
wouldn't do much good. This alien could be anywhere at any time.<br>
TORRES: But what if we could perform a magneton scan on the entire ship
all at once?<br>
JANEWAY: What do you suggest?<br>
TORRES: A magneton flash scan. We could reconfigure every sensor array
on the ship to emit a single burst. It might be enough to illuminate
any anomalous energy. Harry, what do you think?<br>
(Harry is staring at nothing, so Tuvok draws his phaser and Torres gets
out a tricorder.) <br>
KIM: Whoa. What did I do?<br>
TUVOK: Stay where you are, Mister Kim.<br>
TORRES: I don't see anything unusual, but that doesn't mean anything.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Kim, what were you doing just now?<br>
KIM: I was just thinking. I was remembering an old study I saw about
magneton scanners. I guess my mind started to wander a bit.<br>
JANEWAY: I'm very disturbed by what just happened here. We don't have
any idea what occurs when someone is occupied by this alien presence.
If we start pointing a finger every time someone gets distracted, it
won't be long before outright paranoia starts sweeping the ship. Tuvok,
B'Elanna, I want you to get started on that magneton flash scan. It's
worth a try. Dismissed. </font></p>

EMH is checking on Kes.) <br>
NEELIX: And that's not all. Ensign Parsons ordered his pejuta cold.<br>
EMH: So?<br>
NEELIX: He always drinks it hot. Hot! With lemon. But not today. Today
it's cold pejuta, hold the lemon.<br>
EMH: Mister Neelix, just because a man changes his drink order doesn't
mean he's possessed by an alien.<br>
NEELIX: Nevertheless, don't you think you should scan him or dissect
him or something, just to make sure?<br>
EMH: I could examine every crew member you've mentioned so far, every
person on board, for that matter and it wouldn't do any good. From what
we can tell, the alien can jump from person to person at will.<br>
NEELIX: It sounds to me like you're defending Ensign Parsons.<br>
EMH: I'm not defending him, I'm just pointing out that you're acting a
little paranoid. In fact, one could say you're acting a little too
paranoid.<br>
NEELIX: Are you suggesting that I, that I could possibly? Doctor, I can
assure you, not even an alien intruder could make me do anything to
hurt Kes.<br>
EMH: All I'm suggesting, Mister Neelix, is that paranoia is only going
to aggravate your already precarious emotional condition. Try to relax.
I don't think Kes has suffered any permanent neurological damage. I'll
let you know the moment I've had any success in reviving her.<br>
NEELIX: I'll be back as soon as you wake, dearest. And don't worry,
you're in good hands. Thank you, Doctor.<br>

EMH: What are you doing?<br>
TUVOK: I am reconfiguring the sensor relays on the ship. This will only
take a minute.<br>
EMH: Must you do it now? I'm in the middle of a treatment.<br>
TUVOK: I am sorry, Doctor. Captain's orders. How is she?<br>
EMH: No irreparable damage. In fact, her injuries are quite different
from Commander Chakotay's. Her bioneural energy is completely intact,
and I'm curious about these contusions on her neck and shoulder.
They're not consistent with an energy discharge. They look more like
wounds sustained during a physical struggle.<br>
TUVOK: Odd. There was no physical struggle that I can recall.<br>
EMH: I just don't understand it. The only thing these injuries come
close to resembling is an extreme trauma to the trapezius nerve bundle.
It's as though her nerve fibres have been ruptured. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Come in.<br>
TUVOK: Lieutenant Torres and I will be ready to initiate the magneton
scan in approximately two hours. You should be aware that it will be a
high-intensity burst. It will cause dizziness and disorientation in all
crew members, including myself, for several seconds.<br>
JANEWAY: Make a ship-wide announcement before you initiate the scan.<br>
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. There is another matter of some concern. It
appears that Kes's injuries were not caused by an energy discharge. The
doctor has found evidence that she was physically assaulted.<br>
JANEWAY: Assaulted? But you weren't physically assaulted.<br>
TUVOK: That is correct.<br>
JANEWAY: Is it possible that you inflicted her wounds?<br>
TUVOK: Me?<br>
JANEWAY: Maybe you were inhabited by the alien at that moment.<br>
TUVOK: It is possible. Perhaps we should have the doctor run a
neurological scan to see if I show a memory disruption.<br>
JANEWAY: Agreed. Janeway to Sickbay. Computer, activate Emergency
Medical Holographic System.<br>
COMPUTER: Unable to comply. The EMH programme has been disabled.<br>
JANEWAY: Disabled? By whom?<br>
COMPUTER: Unknown.<br>
JANEWAY: The Doctor's initialisation routine has been locked out. It's
encrypted. I can't reactivate the programme.<br>
TUVOK: It appears the lockout originated somewhere above deck four.<br>
JANEWAY: Why would someone deactivate the Doctor?<br>
TUVOK: The Doctor does hold the command codes to Voyager.<br>
JANEWAY: Yes, but once he was deactivated the codes automatically
reverted back to me.<br>
TUVOK: If we assume the alien could not take over the holographic
doctor, then logically it would try to force the command codes back
into a humanoid host.<br>
JANEWAY: Me. It's too dangerous for one person to retain the command
codes at this point. I suggest we divide my command protocols into two
code groupings.<br>
TUVOK: A sensible precaution.<br>
JANEWAY: You would be the reasonable choice to hold the second
grouping, if there's any such thing as a reasonable choice right now.
The alien could occupy either one of us at any time.<br>
TUVOK: But presumably not both of us at the same time.<br>
JANEWAY: I'll tell the bridge crew the plan. We'll all have to act as
checks and balances for each other. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (The
thing is watching from above.) <br>
JANEWAY: I want you all to be aware of something that has happened,
something I must assume was due to the alien. The Doctor has been
deactivated, and we can't get him back online. I have decided to divide
my command protocols.<br>
TUVOK: Captain? <br>
(Janeway hits Tuvok, knocking him down. He draws a phaser but she kicks
it out of his hand.) <br>
TUVOK: Stun her! She's the alien! <br>
(Paris obeys. Then Kim pulls his phaser and Paris disarms him. Next to
try and shoot Tuvok is Durst, but he misses. Paris hits him then Tuvok
stuns all the bridge crew with a wide burst.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Paris
gives Janeway a hypo.) <br>
PARIS: That should do it, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Thank you, Mister Paris. I feel better already. Any luck
getting the Doctor back online?<br>
KIM: Not yet. Whoever did this put up one hell of a roadblock. I'm
going to have to break through at least six levels of encryption to
access the holo-emitters.<br>
JANEWAY: How long is it going to take?<br>
KIM: Two, maybe three hours.<br>
TORRES [OC]: Torres to Janeway.<br>
JANEWAY: Go ahead.<br>
TORRES [OC]: Captain, can you come down to Engineering? There's
something here I think you should see.<br>
JANEWAY: I'm on my way. Mister Paris, you're our temporary medic until
the Doctor returns.<br>
PARIS: Right.<br>
JANEWAY: Ensign, I need you on the Bridge. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
I've been trying to reconstruct the damaged sensor logs from Tuvok and
Chakotay's shuttlecraft. I didn't have any luck until I ran a parity
trace scan. Captain, the sensor logs weren't destroyed by an energy
discharge. Someone erased them, and then overloaded the sensor matrix
to make it look like they'd been damaged. It gets worse. There was
enough information left in the backup logs for me to reconstruct what
happened during the attack. They were near a dark matter nebula and an
energy discharge did breach the hull, but there was no other ship.<br>
JANEWAY: No ship?<br>
TORRES: I'm certain of it. From what I can tell, the energy discharge
came from the nebula itself.<br>
JANEWAY: Why would Tuvok lie about an attack?<br>
TORRES: He must have been under the alien's influence.<br>
KIM: [OC]: Bridge to Janeway. We're approaching the dark matter nebula.<br>
JANEWAY: Acknowledged. How long until the magneton flash scan is ready
to go?<br>
TORRES: The sensor arrays are charging now. Fifteen, maybe twenty
minutes.<br>
JANEWAY: When it's ready, transfer control of the scan to the Bridge.
In the meantime, I think we should take a look at exactly what it is
we're not supposed to see. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok, can you locate the ion trail of the alien ship
that attacked you?<br>
TUVOK: I believe so. Mister Kim, lay in that course. Shields are at
maximum, Captain. All preparations for entering the nebula are complete.<br>
PARIS: Captain, I've finished the bioanalysis the doctor was running on
Kes before he was deactivated. I think he was on to something. If I'm
interpreting his data correctly, the bruises on Kes's neck and
shoulders were the result of a Vulcan neck pinch.<br>
JANEWAY: Lieutenant?<br>
TUVOK: I have no memory of injuring Kes. Perhaps I was occupied by the
alien at that time.<br>
JANEWAY: Perhaps so, but then, why does it keep attacking you? In three
separate instances now, it's assaulted you.<br>
TUVOK: I am the Chief of Security. It may see me as a particular threat.<br>
JANEWAY: So far, you've posed no greater threat than anyone else, and
yet it keeps going after you.<br>
TUVOK: Captain, I believe you are having a typically human response to
circumstances which are frightening and inexplicable, commonly known as
paranoia.<br>
JANEWAY: Maybe, but I don't think it's paranoia that's keeping me from
picking up this ion trail of yours. What bandwidth are you on?<br>
TUVOK: I'm using a multiphasic scan. If you examine the alpha K band,
you will see it.<br>
JANEWAY: Yes, here it is. A very interesting ion trail. There's no sign
of any subspace distortions in its wake. According to these readings,
it's a ship without engines. You're lying, Tuvok. There is no alien
ship, and there never was. We're not going inside that nebula until we
get some answers. Mister Kim, reverse course and <br>
TUVOK: (draws phaser) Belay that order. That is exactly what the alien
has been trying to do, keep us from entering the nebula. I suspect the
captain has been occupied. I am relieving her of command. Ensign,
proceed into the nebula, one half impulse.<br>
JANEWAY: Don't do it, Harry.<br>
TUVOK: Now, Ensign.<br>
KIM: No sir, I won't do it.<br>
TUVOK: I must inform you this phaser is on wide beam dispersal and set
to kill. I am taking command of this Bridge. I must ask you all to
stand together where I can see you. Step away from the console, Ensign.<br>
(Tuvok takes over the operations console. The crew report to Janeway in
hushed tones.) <br>
DURST: Captain, we're entering the nebula.<br>
KIM: Captain, I'm picking up some kind of energy pulses in the nebula,
highly coherent, with a biomatrix.<br>
JANEWAY: Life forms.<br>
KIM: And they're heading this way.<br>
JANEWAY: (to Tuvok) Those beings out there, are they your people?<br>
TUVOK: We are the Komar. This is our domain.<br>
(Down in Engineering, the thing flies around. Torres suddenly stiffens
then goes to a control panel and does something. The ship jolts.)<br>
JANEWAY: What's happening?<br>
DURST: The warp core's been ejected.<br>
TUVOK: No. No! We must continue.<br>
TORRES [OC]: Torres to Bridge. Captain </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
I think I was just taken over by the alien. One second I was working

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES
[OC]: The warp core.<br>
JANEWAY: Acknowledged, Lieutenant. Stand by.<br>
PARIS: I don't get it. If the alien's in Tuvok, how could it be down in
Engineering at the same time?<br>
KIM: I don't know. Unless there are two aliens.<br>
PARIS: Two?<br>
JANEWAY: Wait a minute. Lieutenant Torres isn't authorised to eject the
warp core on her own. That requires a command code authorisation.
Computer, who authorised the ejection of the warp core?<br>
COMPUTER: The authorisation was entered by Commander Chakotay.<br>
JANEWAY: Chakotay.<br>
KIM: How is that possible?<br>
JANEWAY: The alien in Tuvok wants us in that nebula, but there's
another presence that's been trying to keep us out. It doesn't make
sense, unless it's Chakotay and he knows we'll be in danger if we go in
there.<br>
KIM: But he's in Sickbay. He's brain dead.<br>
JANEWAY: Maybe not. Maybe his neural energy was displaced somehow and
he's able to move from person to person.<br>
DURST: Tuvok's engaged emergency thrusters. We're moving again, Captain.<br>
(Voyager enters the nebula.) <br>
JANEWAY: You brought us here, for what? To extract our neural energy? <br>
TUVOK: Very perceptive, Captain. The collective neural energy of your
crew will sustain my people for years to come.<br>
JANEWAY: You don't have to do this. Maybe we can help you find another
source of energy.<br>
KIM: Captain, we're under attack. We're being bombarded by the energy
beings.<br>
(Janeway activates the flash-scan. Tuvok is stunned and blinded, so
Paris can take the phaser off him. Tuvok collapses before Paris can
stun him. An energy leaves him and goes through the bulkhead. Paris
runs a medical tricorder over Tuvok and nods to Janeway.) <br>
JANEWAY: The magneton scan identified the entity before it left the
ship. It was a trianic-based energy being.<br>
KIM: Looks like he's joined his friends outside.<br>
(Whumph.) <br>
PARIS: Shields are holding, but they won't last long at this rate, and
the electromagnetic radiation is blinding our sensors. I can't find a
way out.<br>
JANEWAY: Come about. Maybe if we reverse course, we can just backtrack.<br>
PARIS: Yes, ma'am.<br>
KIM: I don't know if that'll work, Captain. Tuvok was navigating a
complicated course. We could be going deeper into the nebula.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Kim, maybe you can reconstruct Tuvok's navigational
logs.<br>
KIM: I'm on it, Captain.<br>
(Whumph.) <br>
DURST: Shields down to sixty five percent, Captain! The energy beings
are starting to penetrate our defences.<br>
(In Sickbay, an entity enters Neelix. He goes to the medicine wheel and
moves the stones.) <br>
KIM: I'm not having any luck. Tuvok deleted the navigational logs as he
went along. He wanted to make sure we didn't get out of here.<br>
NEELIX [OC]: Neelix to Bridge.<br>
JANEWAY: Go ahead.<br>
NEELIX [OC]: Captain, I can't be sure but </font></p>

[OC]: And I've done something very strange. I've rearranged the stones
on the medicine wheel.<br>
JANEWAY: If it's Chakotay, maybe he's trying to tell us something.
Mister Kim, activate Sickbay visual relay sixteen and put it on the
view screen.<br>
KIM: Aye, Captain.<br>
(A picture of the medicine wheel is on the viewscreen.) <br>
JANEWAY: What is it? What does it mean? Is it a code, a message?<br>
PARIS: Or a map.<br>
JANEWAY: Computer, overlay a star map of the nebula on the current
viewscreen image.<br>
PARIS: The stones are in the same position as those three planetoids.
Chakotay must be using them to point a way out.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Kim, lay in a course that takes us along a line
connecting those three planetoids. Engage.<br>
(It is a bumpy ride.) <br>
DURST: Shields failing. The aliens are penetrating the hull.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Kim, report.<br>
KIM: We're passing the third planetoid now, Captain. The dark matter
density is thinning. Reading normal space ahead.<br>
JANEWAY: Bridge to Torres. Transfer all remaining power to the
thrusters, including life support.<br>
KIM: We've cleared the nebula, Captain. Main power coming back online.
Shields at full strength, hull integrity normal. The alien beings are
not pursuing. </font></p>

Captain's log, stardate 48735.9. We have returned to the co-ordinates
where we ejected the warp core and have successfully retrieved it. Now
we're hoping the Doctor will be able to successfully reintegrate
Commander Chakotay's consciousness. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
(Janeway and Torres are looking over the EMH's shoulders.) <br>
JANEWAY: Did it work?<br>
EMH: It appears so. Commander. Can you hear me?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes. I'm a little dizzy, but I think I'm all here.<br>
TORRES: How did you manage to reintegrate his consciousness?<br>
EMH: It involved three neural transceivers, two cortical stimulators
and fifty gigaquads of computer memory. I would be happy to take you
through the process, but it would take at least ten hours to explain it
all to you. Needless to say, it was a remarkable procedure. I would
consider writing a paper about it if there were a convenient forum in
which to publish it.<br>
(Janeway puts her hands on Chakotay's bare shoulder.) <br>
JANEWAY: What happened, Commander?<br>
CHAKOTAY: After the attack on the shuttle, I had the sensation of
floating above my own body. I thought I was dead.<br>
JANEWAY: And when the shuttle returned to Voyager you were still
disembodied?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes. I couldn't speak, I couldn't touch anything. But then I
found if I concentrated on someone who was in the room with me, I could
share their consciousness. At first I could only do little things with
the host's body. Push buttons, work a console. As time went on, it
became easier to do more. I'm sorry I had to knock you around, Tuvok.<br>
TUVOK: No apology is necessary.<br>
JANEWAY: Good job, Commander, and welcome back.<br>
CHAKOTAY: To be honest, I feel like I never left. </font> </p>
