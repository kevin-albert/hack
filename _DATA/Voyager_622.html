CHAKOTAY: They're using a cyclic pulsar to amplify signals from the
MIDAS array, but the cycle only peaks every thirty two days. <br>
JANEWAY: So once a month we'll be able to receive a short burst of
information. And we'll have about seventeen hours to respond. <br>
CHAKOTAY: So far we've gotten tactical updates, letters from home, and
news about the Alpha Quadrant. <br>
KIM: I don't suppose they found us a shortcut home. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It doesn't look that way. <br>

NEELIX: Zimmerman? <br>
EMH: He's the father of modern holography. He invented the matrix that
made my programme possible. <br>
NEELIX: Oh. What's wrong with him? <br>
EMH: He's suffering from acute subcellular degradation. The doctors
here are having trouble finding the cause, much less a treatment. I've
included his medical files. As you'll see, the prognosis isn't good.
They say he's only got a few months. I'm sorry I don't have better news
to report, but I thought you'd want to know. <br>
NEELIX: How well did you know him? <br>
EMH: I've never met the man. <br>

nineteen hundred hours.

Here's the information you requested. <br>
EMH: Thank you. <br>
SEVEN: You're reviewing his medical data. <br>
EMH: I thought I could send Starfleet a second opinion. It's a long
shot, but maybe my experiences in the Delta Quadrant could provide some
insights. I was hoping these Borg regeneration techniques might help
them develop a treatment for his condition. <br>
SEVEN: You bear a striking resemblance. <br>
EMH: He used his own physical parameters as a model for my matrix.
Can't say I blame him. A doctor needs to inspire confidence in his
patients. Compassionate eyes and a strong chin can go a long way.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: I
believe I can help him, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: How? <br>
EMH: You remember the Vidiians? The early stages of the Phage are very
similar to Doctor Zimmerman's disease. I believe I can adapt a variety
of Borg regeneration techniques to arrest the cell damage, maybe even
reverse it. <br>
JANEWAY: Make sure to pass along your findings. Thank you, Doctor. <br>
EMH: Actually, I was hoping to administer the treatment myself. <br>
JANEWAY: What are you suggesting? <br>
EMH: I'd like you to send my programme back to the Alpha Quadrant. None
of the Doctors at Starfleet are familiar with these techniques. It
would take them months to fully understand them, much less put them to
use. <br>
JANEWAY: Even if we could send you, you're needed here. <br>
EMH: Mister Paris can take over Sickbay. He's more than capable. We've
done this once before. There weren't any problems. <br>
JANEWAY: Three years ago, and we used alien technology. <br>
EMH: I've spoken to Seven of Nine. She believes we can compress my
programme. <br>
JANEWAY: There's limited space in the datastream. If we send you,
there won't be room for anything else. <br>
EMH: I realise I'd be asking the crew to make a sacrifice on my behalf,
but they can wait another month. Doctor Zimmerman might not have that
time. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry he's not doing well. Unusual man. I met him once at
a conference. He managed to offend just about everyone there, but he
was certainly brilliant. I'm sure Starfleet is consulting their best
physicians, Doctor. <br>
EMH: They are, but no one's been able to develop a cure. I have. But I
can't treat a patient who's thirty thousand light years away. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry. <br>
EMH: Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: This is the first time we're attempting to send a response. We
don't know if it will even get through. <br>
EMH: I'm willing to take that risk. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm not. <br>
EMH: He programmed me. Every algorithm, every subroutine. If it weren't
for his years of work, I wouldn't be standing here. I owe him
something. And frankly, so does this crew. In a way, he's responsible
for every
life I've saved. <br>
JANEWAY: Lewis Zimmerman designed the template for Starfleet's EMH.
You're one of thousands based on that technology. It's not as though
he's your father. <br>
EMH: From your perspective. From mine, he's the closest thing I've got.
If I don't try to help him now, I may never get the chance. <br>
JANEWAY: You'll have to find a way to convince Tom to take those duty
shifts. <br>
EMH: He's already agreed. <br>
JANEWAY: Tell him Captain Jane said hello. That's what he kept calling
me at the conference. I think he did it just to get on my nerves. <br>
EMH: I've heard he can be difficult. <br>
JANEWAY: I certainly hope you get a chance to find out. <br>

SEVEN: It's not a malfunction. I've removed your singing algorithms.
They'll be stored in a memory buffer until you return. <br>
EMH: Why? <br>
SEVEN: Your programme's too large for the datastream. I have to
extract all non-essential subroutines. <br>

EMH: I get the point. How much has to be left behind? <br>
SEVEN: Twelve megaquads. <br>
EMH: I suppose you could get rid of my athletic abilities and my
grand master chess programme. <br>
SEVEN: That leaves three megaquads. Your painting skills? <br>
EMH: Oh, if you must. Try to leave a few of my enhancements intact. I
don't want to look like every other EMH on the block. I think Doctor
Zimmerman will be very interested to see what I've learned. He probably
never imagined what one of his own creations could accomplish. I could
spark a whole new field in holographic research.

scrub plasma conduits on waste transfer barges. I've been treated by
the Mark Three, the Mark Four, not to mention the finest real doctors
in Starfleet. None of them could help me.<br>
BARCLAY: He has been running almost continuously for six years. He has
seen more things than most doctors can even imagine. <br>
EMH: I also have an exceptionally high tolerance for difficult
patients. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: I didn't programme you for sarcasm. <br>
EMH: You'll find I'm full of surprises. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Show the good Doctor to the plasma generator. I understand
there's quite a build-up of residue. <br>
EMH: If we had more time, I'd enjoy trading barbs with you. But right
now, there's a more pressing concern. Your life. I'm working on a
treatment based on a disease I encountered in the Delta Quadrant, but
I'll need to run a complete analysis. However, if it's impossible for
you to believe that a lowly Mark One could have anything useful to
offer, I'll be happy to pack my bags and go explore those sulphur mines.

EMH: If he were skilled, intelligent, creative. <br>
TROI: Honestly, Doctor? A hundred years ago? <br>
EMH: Well, I suppose it would give me pause. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Ha. <br>
TROI: Now, put yourself in the Doctor's shoes. Imagine you were asked
to treat someone you cared about, say an EMH Mark twelve. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: There is no Mark twelve. <br>
TROI: But if there were, and you wanted to save his programme. He
probably wouldn't let you near him. He wouldn't care that you'd won the
Daystrom Prize for holography. From his perspective, you'd be out of
date. But what if you knew you could save him? <br>
EMH: Thank you, Counsellor, for extending that olive branch. I'm
willing to see past our differences, if he is. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: All right. He can start by purging the plasma conduits on
deck six. <br>
TROI: Doctor Zimmerman. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: I will not put my life in the hands of a primitive. <br>
EMH: You'd need a phaser drill to get through that thick skull of his. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Get out! <br>
TROI: Gentlemen! <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Oh, spare us your psychobabble. <br>
TROI: I came here thinking that you were opposite sides of the same
coin. Identical, but different. Now I see you're both exactly the same.
You're both jerks. <br>
LEONARD: Jerks.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TROI:
I'm starting to think you called the wrong counsellor, Reg. <br>
BARCLAY: You'll figure something out. You always do. <br>
TROI: Things are worse now than when I arrived. Lewis won't come out of
his lab and the EMH is hiding in a holodeck. <br>
BARCLAY: He's feeling homesick. I let him use my Voyager simulation and
it seems to be cheering him up. <br>
TROI: A hologram fighting to save the life of his creator, who just so
happens to be the same man his own personality is based on. I think I'd
need a whole team of therapists just to get them in the same room. <br>
HALEY: Mister Barclay said this is your favourite ice cream. <br>
TROI: I hardly deserve it, but thanks. You're a hologram. <br>
HALEY: How do you know? <br>
TROI: I'm an empath. I haven't sensed any emotions from you. When were
you first brought online? <br>
HALEY: Nine years ago. <br>
TROI: No offence but, you're more antiquated than the EMH Mark One, and
yet Lewis seems to listen to you. Why do you suppose that is? Were you
here when the Mark One was created? <br>
HALEY: Yes. <br>
TROI: Any idea why Lewis made it in his own image? <br>
HALEY: Maybe you should ask him. <br>
TROI: I did. He evaded the question. I was hoping you might know. <br>
HALEY: He was extremely proud of the Mark One. He used to dream about
hundreds of holograms in every corner of the quadrant saving lives. He
put so much of himself into its development. I suppose it only seemed
natural that it should look like him, too. <br>
TROI: But the Mark One failed to meet Starfleet's expectations. <br>
HALEY: He was devastated. <br>
BARCLAY: He, he locked himself away in this lab for two years trying to
repair the defects. Finally, he just gave up. Started from scratch. A
whole new matrix. <br>
TROI: The Mark Two. <br>
BARCLAY: Followed by the Mark Three, and then the Mark Four. He, he was
obsessed with perfecting it. <br>
TROI: But none of the later models resembled Lewis. <br>
HALEY: He made that mistake once. He wasn't about to do it again. <br>
TROI: And now, after all this time, a Mark One shows up. It must be
like staring in a mirror at a reflection you don't want to remember.

Computer, resume recording. Last Will and Testament, Doctor Lewis
Zimmerman. Let's see. Where were we? Subsection eight, the Trojan Horse
project. I hereby bequeath my latest research in holographic
infiltration technology to the only engineer I trust to complete the
work, Lieutenant Reginald Barclay. Subsection nine, holographic art. I
hereby bequeath my entire collection, including the twenty first
century masterpiece, Woman in Four Dimensions, to the person who has
appreciated it the most. I guess that would be Reg Barclay, too.
Subsection ten, Haley. I realise she's only a hologram, but she's been
a loyal assistant for many years. I'd like to request that Starfleet
keep her programme running for as long as this research facility
exists. She's been as real to me as anyone I've ever known. Not that
I've known many people. I've created most of my friends. <br>(He is struck by a stab of pain that takes his breath away.)<br>ZIMMERMAN: Pause

this is Voyager. I like it. <br>
EMH: It's a remarkable facsimile, but Mister Barclay did get a few of
the details wrong. For one thing, Neelix doesn't purr. <br>
TROI: I think that may have something to do with Reg's cat. He named it
after your friend. <br>
EMH: Neelix would be honoured. If you're here for Doctor Zimmerman's

TROI: Lieutenant Barclay, Haley, myself, Doctor Zimmerman. <br>
EMH: No, thanks. Unless that man's eating crow, I'm not interested. <br>
TROI: It's the perfect opportunity for us to talk things out in a more

ZIMMERMAN: I'll send them a Mark Four. They're more reliable. <br>
BARCLAY: They don't want a Mark Four. They want their friend. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: No EMH was ever designed to be anyone's friend. He's just a

ZIMMERMAN: I will not be ambushed in my own lab. <br>
HALEY: Stardate 53292. My programme malfunctioned and you cancelled a
lecture on Vulcan and came all the way home to repair me. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: There's nothing worse than addressing a room full of
pointy-eared blowhards. I was looking for an excuse to get away. <br>
HALEY: You came back because you cared about me, just like you care
about the Mark One. You just won't admit it. He may not be perfect, but
he's still one of your creations and right now he needs his creator.
Don't turn your back on him. <br>(Later, Zimmerman forks some salad into his mouth and presses buttons.)<br>ZIMMERMAN:
Computer, activate Voyager's EMH. <br>
EMH: Please state the nature of the medical emergency. <br>

EMH: Where's Lieutenant Barclay? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Trust me, you're in far more capable hands. <br>
EMH: You're going to repair my programme? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Who better? <br>
EMH: Just yesterday you threatened to decompile me. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: That was before your colleagues made me feel guilty. <br>
EMH: You're ill. You're in no condition to perform delicate procedures.
<br>
ZIMMERMAN: I'll survive, but you won't if you don't relax and let me
finish. <br>
EMH: What are you doing? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: My scans identified a recursive error in your pattern
buffer. I'm trying to isolate it. <br>
EMH: Is that a fractal algorithm? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Very good. I'm using it to realign your matrix. <br>
EMH: Fractal algorithms are notoriously unstable. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: In the hands of a novice. (Beep!) Whoops. <br>
EMH: Whoops? What's whoops? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Computer, deactivate EMH. <br>(Later, the EMH is reactivated.)<br>EMH: I,
I can't move! <br>
ZIMMERMAN: I know. I had to take your mobility subroutines offline. <br>
EMH: How long have I been deactivated? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Seventeen hours. I'm resetting your parameters. <br>(The EMH goes off and on, and walks over to Zimmerman.)<br>
EMH: You don't look well. You need rest. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: I'm fine. And so are you. Your programme's been stabilised. <br>
EMH: I, I'm going to be okay? <br>

today? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Well, what do you think? <br>
EMH: I think you've altered my greeting protocol. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: That's just the beginning. I've also added new subroutines
for compassion, patience, empathy, decorum. <br>
EMH: I don't feel any different. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Because I haven't installed them yet. I thought you'd like
to be awake for the big moment. Reginald was right about you. You have
exceeded the sum of your programming. You've accomplished far more than
I would have ever predicted. But let's face facts. You never overcame
the inherent flaws in your personality subroutines. You're arrogant,
irritable. A jerk, as Counsellor Troi would say. <br>
EMH: I believe she was describing you as well. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Don't change the subject. I may not be able to turn you into
a Mark Four, but I can make you a bit more presentable. <br>
EMH: What if I'm happy with the way I am? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: I'm doing you a favour. <br>
EMH: I don't want any favours and I don't want your new subroutines.
Why can't you accept me as I am? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Because you're defective. Emergency Medical Hotheads.
Extremely Marginal Housecalls. That's what everyone used to call the
Mark Ones until they were bounced out of the Medical Corps. I tried to
have them decommissioned, but Starfleet in its infinite wisdom
overruled me and reassigned them all to work waste transfer barges.
That's where you'd be too, if you hadn't been lost in the Delta
Quadrant. Do you know how humiliating it is to have six hundred and
seventy five Mark Ones out there, scrubbing plasma conduits, all with
my face? <br>
EMH: I'm sure they're doing a fine job. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: What are you doing? I'm not finished with you. (The EMH is scanning him.)<br>
EMH: I'm trying to do my job. And if you give me a chance you'll see
that I'm pretty good at it. Frankly, I'd hoped that if we ever met,
you'd be proud of me. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Well, I guess it is comforting to know that at least one of
you is still doing what I designed you to do. <br>
EMH: Your intercellular proteins are at a dangerous level. We should
begin the procedure. Please, give me a chance to make you proud of me. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Maybe we could try it, see how it goes. <br>
EMH: See how it goes. <br>

know anything about that, would you? <br>
TROI: Well, traditional therapy wasn't getting us anywhere. <br>
