(Janeway opens the drawing room windows to let in the sunshine.) <br>
JANEWAY: Good morning children. I'm your new governess, Mrs Davenport.
Too formal. Henry, Beatrice, I'm so glad to meet you. I've heard so
much about you, and I'm sure we're going to be very good friends. Oh,
too familiar. Hello, I'm Mrs Davenport. Your father has asked me here
to be your new governess.<br>
(The children enter quietly behind her.) <br>
HENRY: Something he did without mentioning in to us.<br>
JANEWAY: Good morning, children. It's good to see you. You must be
Henry. And this is Beatrice.<br>
(Janeway holds out her hand. Henry gives a little bow.) <br>
HENRY: Henry Burleigh, Viscount Timmons. My sister, the Lady Beatrice
Flora. You will address us as my Lord and my Lady.<br>
JANEWAY: Of course, my Lord. Please, sit down. Let's get to know one
another, shall we? I'm Mrs Davenport. I hope to be a friend to you as
well as a governess.<br>
HENRY: In ullam rem ne properemus.<br>
JANEWAY: I beg your pardon?<br>
HENRY: In ullam rem ne properemus. Is your Latin a bit rusty?<br>
JANEWAY: I suppose it is.<br>
HENRY: Then I don't see how you'll be doing my lessons with me.<br>
JANEWAY: My Lord, I assure you that I am more than qualified to
instruct you. I may have to brush up on my Latin, but when it comes to
mathematics and the sciences, I'm sure you'll find my lessons
challenging. And Beatrice, what do you like to study?<br>
BEATRICE: Nothing.<br>
JANEWAY: Not even painting or needlework?<br>
BEATRICE: I just made my first sampler. I finished it yesterday.<br>
JANEWAY: Did you? Oh, I'd love to see it sometime.<br>
BEATRICE: I don't have it anymore. I gave it to Mother.<br>
HENRY: Beatrice! My sister is confused. She gave the sampler to Mother
before she died.<br>
BEATRICE: No, I didn't. I gave it to her last night.<br>
HENRY: Beatrice!<br>
BEATRICE: I talked to her!<br>
HENRY: Beatrice is upset, Mrs Davenport. She hasn't yet accepted our
mother's death.<br>
JANEWAY: Beatrice, I know it was a terrible thing to lose your mother. <br>
BEATRICE: She's not dead! I saw her last night!<br>
(Beatrice vanishes.) <br>
HENRY: What have you done to my sister?<br>
(Henry vanishes.) <br>
JANEWAY: Computer, restore characters in programme Janeway lambda one.<br>

CHAKOTAY: Power fluctuations on deck six, Captain. Mister Tuvok is
investigating.<br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Keep me informed. Janeway out. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Tuvok
finds an open access panel.) <br>
TUVOK: Tuvok to Lieutenant Torres. Has any equipment repair been
authorised on Deck six?<br>
TORRES [OC] Negative. What's going on?<br>
TUVOK: Stand by.<br>
(A head pokes out of the access area.) <br>
DALBY: Be careful! Sorry. You might have broken the connection.<br>
TUVOK: Crewman Dalby, what are you doing here?<br>
DALBY: One of the bio-neural gel packs was malfunctioning. I had to
replace it.<br>
TUVOK: Did you inform Lieutenant Torres?<br>
DALBY: Not yet. I was just going to take this to Engineering for
analysis.<br>
TUVOK: On this ship we have a protocol for such procedures.<br>
DALBY: I was in the area, I saw a malfunctioning gel pack and I fixed
it. What's the problem?<br>
TUVOK: Your repair interrupted a number of ships functions. That is the
problem.<br>
DALBY: I guess I'm used to doing things a little differently. On our
ship, when something went wrong, you fixed it.<br>
TUVOK: I would remind you, Mister Dalby, that you are no longer on a
Maquis ship.<br>
DALBY: I'm well aware of that, Lieutenant. And every minute of every
day I regret it. I was just trying to do my job, trying to help out. If
that goes against Starfleet's almighty rules then put me in the brig.
Otherwise, leave me alone. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
Captain's log, stardate 48846.5. Ordinarily the loss of a gel pack
would be a minor inconvenience, but here in the Delta Quadrant it's a
reminder of the precarious nature of our journey. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Ready
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: I don't understand. The gel packs have an extremely reliable
track record. It's almost impossible to damage them. Why did this one
malfunction?<br>
TUVOK: Unknown. Lieutenant Torres is running a materials analysis on
the gel pack. In the mean time the unit has been replaced.<br>
JANEWAY: How many do we have left in reserve?<br>
TUVOK: Forty seven.<br>
JANEWAY: Those gel packs run half the critical systems on this ship.
Once they run out, that's it. We can't replicate new ones.<br>
CHAKOTAY: It might be possible to switch over some systems to
conventional isolinear circuits.<br>
JANEWAY: Good idea. Start looking into it.<br>
TUVOK: There is one other matter I wish to discuss. I am concerned
about Crewman Dalby. He attempted to make unauthorised repairs on a
damaged gel pack. When I confronted him, he lost control.<br>
JANEWAY: How so?<br>
TUVOK: He became extremely angry, to the point of insubordination.<br>
JANEWAY: Dalby. I've heard complaints about him from others.<br>
TUVOK: Indeed. This is not the first incident involving Mister Dalby.
Last week he was found tampering with ship's systems to increase a
friends replicator rations, and he has missed three of his last ten
duty shifts.<br>
JANEWAY: Commander, you know Mister Dalby better than I do. Any idea
what might be bothering him?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Dalby's always been pretty aggressive. My guess is the man's
frustrated. He's not used to dealing with Starfleet protocol and
procedures.<br>
TUVOK: A starship cannot run without protocols. Mister Dalby's attitude
is disrupting this vessels operations.<br>
CHAKOTAY: What do you suggest? Dragging him in front of a disciplinary
board?<br>
TUVOK: Perhaps that would be the best approach.<br>
JANEWAY: I doubt that's going to help. Dalby's not the only Maquis
who's having problems adjusting. And besides, it's not only a matter of
attitude, it's also a matter of experience. It's not fair to expect
Starfleet behaviour from people who never went to the Academy.<br>
TUVOK: What do you propose?<br>
JANEWAY: We need to bring some of these people up to speed. Instruct
them in how to run a Starfleet vessel. Show them why we do things the
way we do. Give them an opportunity to feel like they're part of the
team.<br>
CHAKOTAY: A crash course in Starfleet operations. Field training.<br>
JANEWAY: Exactly. So, what do you think, Mister Tuvok. Are you up
training a group of raw cadets?<br>
TUVOK: Me?<br>
JANEWAY: You taught at the Academy for sixteen years. You'd be perfect
for the job.<br>
TUVOK: Commander Chakotay would be a more logical choice to be their
instructor. He is a Maquis, as well as their former Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: That's my point. He doesn't have to earn their respect. We do.<br>
TUVOK: Very well, Captain, I will prepare a curriculum.<br>
JANEWAY: Commander, pick out the Maquis crewmembers you feel would
benefit most from the training. Have them report to Lt Tuvok at the
next duty shift.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Right. Don't worry, Tuvok. I'll tell them to take it easy on
you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Cargo
bay]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
Good morning. We have assembled here because Captain Janeway feels you
would all benefit from additional Starfleet training. Consequently <br>
(A woman with red shoulders and hair band speaks first.) <br>
HENLEY: I think we need some clarification. Just why have we been
singled out for this honour?<br>
TUVOK: The answer to that question would seem to be self evident,
crewman. Interrupting a senior officer is not acceptable behaviour. The
purpose of this training is to familiarise you with Starfleet protocols
so that mistakes like that will be minimised.<br>
(Next up, a Bolian.) <br>
CHELL: Still, the fact remains. That is, if I have permission to speak,
Lieutenant? Thank you. As I was saying, the fact remains that you must
have noticed certain problems with each member of this select group or
we wouldn't be here. I frankly can't imagine what I might have done
that warrants my inclusion.<br>
TUVOK: Crewman Chell.<br>
CHELL: In fact<br>
TUVOK: Your report indicates that you are talkative, disruptive and
unreliable. You promise to do tasks which then go undone. <br>
CHELL: That is a complete exaggeration. Just yesterday I overhauled a
servicing system <br>
TUVOK: Crewman! From this point on you will speak only if you are
spoken to.<br>
CHELL: But Lieutenant, I'm just trying to<br>
TUVOK: Forty laps around the cargo bay. Start running now.<br>
CHELL: But<br>
TUVOK: Fifty laps. <br>
(Chell gives up and starts jogging.)<br>
TUVOK: As I was saying, this class will adhere to standards established
for Starfleet cadets. There will be physical training and academic
studies, as well as tactical situations which will be simulated on the
holodeck. Crewman, have you been listening to me? <br>
(A Bajoran man looks up from the floor.) <br>
TUVOK: Excuse me. I did not hear that answer.<br>
GERRON: Yes.<br>
TUVOK: Speak up, crewman.<br>
GERRON: I said, yes.<br>
TUVOK: From now on you will look at me when I am talking to you.<br>
DALBY: Leave him alone.<br>
TUVOK: What was that?<br>
DALBY: I said, leave him alone. Can't you see he's just a kid? He
shouldn't even be here.<br>
TUVOK: We think he should.<br>
DALBY: You'll probably have me running two hundred laps for this, but I
don't care. The problem we're having, Lieutenant, is that this whole
thing is insulting. We didn't ask to come aboard this ship but we
understand the situation we're in and we've done the best job we can,
and now you're telling us that's not good enough.<br>
TUVOK: That is correct.<br>
DALBY: Well, maybe that's too bad. Maybe we've done the best we can and
that's as good as you're going to get. How about it? Does anybody
really want to be here?<br>
HENLEY: I don't have anything to learn from him.<br>
DALBY: Well I don't think he's going to phaser us, and frankly I'd
rather be in the brig than in here, so let's go.<br>
TUVOK: Crewmen, you are demonstrating rank insubordination. I order all
of you to stay where you are.<br>
DALBY: Chell! Come on, we're leaving. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Mess
hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> GERRON:
I don't know. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to leave like that. I
mean, they're not just going to let us get away with it.<br>
HENLEY: What are they going to do, put us off the ship? Keep us in the
brig for seventy years? Every person on this ship is needed. Nothing's
going to happen.<br>
DALBY: It's not like we're guilty of mutiny. We'll just keep doing our
jobs, same as ever. We're just not going to jump through any Starfleet
hoops.<br>
(Chakotay enters and joins them, moving Chell out of his seat.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: You want to give me your version of what happened?<br>
DALBY: Commander, we're going to live up to our responsibilities on
this ship. We're just not going to be treated like teenage cadets.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I see.<br>
HENLEY: It was ridiculous. Tuvok had Chell running laps around the
cargo bay.<br>
DALBY: And he was picking on Gerron. I don't like it.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Really?<br>
DALBY: Look, Commander, you know as well as I do that we're used to
playing with a different rule book. There's the Starfleet way, and
there's the Maquis way.<br>
CHAKOTAY: And you want to do things the Maquis way?<br>
DALBY: That's right. That's always worked for us.<br>
(Chakotay punches Dalby, who falls off his chair.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's the Maquis way too, isn't it? And if you want to keep
doing it the Maquis was that's fine with me. We can do that tomorrow,
the next day, everyday, until you report to Lieutenant Tuvok. You
understand me? What? How does a Starfleet crewman answer a question?<br>
DALBY: Yes. Sir.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Does anyone else have a problem. </font></p>

TUVOK: These are your study assignments for next week. Please note that
examinations will be conducted randomly with no advance notice. I will
now inspect your uniforms. Crewman Henley, your headband is certainly
festive.<br>
HENLEY: Thank you.<br>
TUVOK: However, it is in violation of regulations. Please check the
protocol files for recommended guidelines. What is this?<br>
(A chunky gold medallion on a chain.) <br>
CHELL: It's a Kazleti design. I studied the technique when I visited
their planet. It took me weeks to learn. I know it doesn't look
complicated but this <br>
TUVOK: This ornament is in violation of the dress code.<br>
CHELL: It was hidden. You could hardly see it.<br>
TUVOK: You will remove it now.<br>
GERRON: I know, I'll have to take off the earring.<br>
TUVOK: Correct. In addition, your boots are scuffed. From now on you
will arrive in polished boots.<br>
GERRON Yes, sir.<br>
TUVOK: Do you have a problem, Mister Dalby?<br>
DALBY: No, sir.<br>
TUVOK: Very well. You will all report to me on deck eleven at nineteen
hundred hours. Dismissed.<br>
HENLEY: What are we going to be doing?<br>
TUVOK: You will find that out at nineteen hundred hours. Dismissed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> DALBY:
I'm going through with this field training, as ordered. I can't say
it's very productive. Frankly, it feels like punishment.<br>
TORRES: In other words you're afraid you won't make it. That you'll
fail this training.<br>
DALBY: Excuse me? That's not what I said, or what I'm thinking. What?
You think I can't make it through this ridiculous exercise? That's
absurd.<br>
TORRES: Fine. Then make it through. (alarm) It's another power failure.<br>
DALBY: It's the gel packs again.<br>
TORRES: Deck four, section nine C. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Bridge to Engineering. Report.<br>
TORRES: It's another malfunction in the bio-neural circuitry. We're
putting a repair crew on it now. Torres out. Dalby. Replace the failed
gel pack and check out the adjoining circuits. Make sure we don't have
some kind of cascade feedback causing this. We can't just keep
replacing these things. Ensign, you're in charge till I get back. I'll
be in Sickbay if you need me. </font></p>

What is it?<br>
TORRES: It's your new patient. It's one of the bio-neural gel packs.<br>
EMH: Ah yes, I'm aware of these devices, but I've never seen one.<br>
TORRES: It's malfunctioning but I can't find anything wrong with it
mechanically. I thought that you could look at the biological component.<br>
EMH: Interesting. <br>
(The EMH puts the pack on a biobed and raises the curved arms over it.)<br>
EMH: Initiate the scan.<br>
KES: Scanning beam is active.<br>
EMH: Ah, ha!<br>
TORRES: What?<br>
EMH: The patient is sick.<br>
TORRES: Can you be more specific?<br>
EMH: To discuss the patient's condition in front of the patient would
be a serious breach of professional etiquette. It's been suggested that
I cultivate a greater sensitivity to my patient's needs. Don't worry,
my little friend. <br>
TORRES: Doctor.<br>
EMH: Very well. The biological component of the circuit device has an
infection. A very contagious one.<br>
TORRES: Is the crew in any danger?<br>
KES: I don't detect any sign of infection in you, Lieutenant.<br>
EMH: I suspect the contagion is not harmful to humanoids. If it were,
we probably would have seen evidence of illness in the crew by now. But
in order to protect the ship's circuitry, you'll have to isolate and
quarantine all the affected gel packs until a treatment regimen can be
initiated.<br>
TORRES: I'll have to take the forward grids off line. We'll lose
replicators but I can reroute the primary systems. How long do you need?<br>
EMH: I don't know. Unless we find the source of the infection, we won't
be able to stop it from spreading.<br>

HENLEY: That's on deck two. We'd have to crawl through over fifty
Jeffries tubes to get there.<br>

Tuvok. Eventually Gerron stops on a ladder for a breather.) <br>

concerned. This pack feels like it's filled with latinum bricks.<br>

reap the highest gain at the lowest cost. Going out with phasers firing
may seem heroic, but in the long run it is merely foolish. Retreat is
often the best possible option.<br>
DALBY: Well, Mister Tuvok, once more you've proven your point. We're
just not Starfleet material. Are we dismissed, sir?<br>
TUVOK: Dismissed. Computer, exit. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Mess
hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Tuvok
is at the other side of his usual table, staring into space.) <br>
NEELIX: I feel that my services as Morale Officer are required.<br>
TUVOK: I assure you, you are wrong.<br>
NEELIX: Oh really? One, no cup of tea. Two, no PADD. Three, you're
sitting on the opposite side from usual. All of that tells me you've
got something on your mind. And what tells me that it's making you
miserable is that cloud of doom that's rising from you like a ground
fog.<br>
TUVOK: I cannot imagine that there are visible emanations which allow
you to interpret my mood. You are making wild assumptions.<br>
NEELIX: Ah, ha. Maquis trainees getting you down? <br>
TUVOK: I do not believe they are responding well to my instruction.<br>
NEELIX: What seems to be the problem?<br>
TUVOK: That is what I have been trying to determine, and I'm afraid I
am at a loss. I have taught literally thousands of cadets and I have
never encountered these difficulties. My methods are sound and
time-honoured. I insist on strict adherence to rules and protocols. I
never waver from that approach. I have always been successful in honing
each cadet into a Starfleet officer.<br>
NEELIX: Come with me, I want to show you something. <br>
(Neelix takes Tuvok to a flower arrangement by the counter.)<br>
NEELIX: These are Keela flowers. Beautiful, and remarkably strong. The
stem is flexible, impossible to break. But occasionally on the same
plant there's a bloom whose stem is not so flexible. Ah, here's one.
And when the stem is brittle, it breaks.<br>
TUVOK: You're saying that the Maquis crew is rigid and inflexible. That
they will never adjust to Starfleet rules.<br>
NEELIX: No, Mister Vulcan, I'm saying that you are rigid and
inflexible, but maybe if you'd learn to bend a little, you might have
better luck with your class. Those Maquis aren't Starfleet cadets. You
can't treat them the same way. Get to know them, try to find out what
they're like inside. You might discover a better teaching method.<br>
TUVOK: I am not sure if I have the ability to find out what they are
like inside. Mister Neelix, what is that?<br>
(An malodorous mound of stuff.) <br>
NEELIX: Brill cheese. I made it from that schplict we brought on board
last week. Ensign Ashmore asked for something called macaroni and
cheese.<br>
TUVOK: Cheese. You must cultivate bacteria to make cheese.<br>
NEELIX: Of course. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
Captain's log, stardate 48859.3. Lieutenant Tuvok has reported what may
be a possible explanation for the infection in the bio-neural gel
packs. I have asked Lieutenant Torres and her team to investigate
Neelix's kitchen. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Mess
hall kitchen]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
Get me a schematic of the airflow patterns for the whole ship.<br>
CREWMAN: Aye Sir.<br>
TORRES: The cheese is full of volatile bacterial spores. It has to stay
isolated in this portable containment field.<br>
CREWWOMAN: What is this?<br>
NEELIX: That's just a Laurelian pudding. It has to simmer for four
hours.<br>
TORRES: The spores must have travelled through that intake and then
into the ventilation system.<br>
TUVOK: Where they were disseminated throughout the ship, subsequently
infecting the bio-neural circuitry.<br>
NEELIX: I feel awful about this. I assure you I had no idea.<br>
(The lights go out.) <br>
TORRES: More gel packs must be down. If this is getting to the
environmental systems we may be in more trouble that we thought.
Neelix, this wasn't your fault. The important thing is that we found
the source. Get the cheese to Sickbay. The Doctor should look at it as
soon as possible.<br>
CREWMAN: Yes, Lieutenant. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
You may break, Mister Dalby.<br>
DALBY: Okay.<br>
TUVOK: Do you play pool often?<br>
DALBY: Not really. I did when I was younger.<br>
TUVOK: Do you have a family?<br>
DALBY: What is this all about?<br>
TUVOK: Pardon?<br>
DALBY: This little exercise. Are we testing my social skills? Does
Starfleet have rules about them too?<br>
TUVOK: I had thought we could get to know each other. Perhaps then our
relationship would function more smoothly.<br>
DALBY: Get to know each other? Okay, here's the brief history of
Kenneth Dalby. We lived on the Bajoran frontier. It was a hard life. I
coped by getting into a lot of trouble. I was angry at everybody and
everything, till a woman came along and taught me about love. For a
while, I wasn't angry any more. Three Cardassians raped her and smashed
her skull. I joined the Maquis and tried to slaughter as many of them
as I could find. How about you? Any family?<br>
TUVOK: I do, but there is nothing to report about them that would
compare with your story. I've observed that you seem to be somewhat
protective of Mister Gerron. Have you formed a friendship with him?<br>
DALBY: No. He won't let me get close. First time I saw him, I thought I
was looking at myself at that age. I thought maybe I could be a friend,
maybe he wouldn't turn out the way I did. But I didn't have much luck.
And then we got stuck out here. Being so far away from home is hard on
somebody that young, so I'd appreciate it if you'd try not to make him
any more miserable that he is already.<br>
TUVOK: Commander Chakotay specifically recommended Mister Gerron for
this programme. He felt that if the young man were able to learn new
skills, to set goals and accomplish them, it might go a long way to
helping him feel better about himself.<br>
DALBY: That's why he's in this group?<br>
TUVOK: It is our intention that the experience be positive for everyone.<br>
DALBY: If you say so. But understand this, Lieutenant. I don't want to
get to know you, and I don't want to be your friend. </font></p>

EMH: What I find curious is that these bacteria didn't show up in any
of our diagnostic scans of the ship. But if the bacteria from the
cheese into the ship's systems, how did the gel packs get infected?<br>
KES: Haven't I read that viruses can live inside bacteria?<br>
EMH: Of course. A virus. The bacteria could be hosts to the infectious
virus. There are thousands of viruses so small they would have escaped
detection.<br>
KES: So maybe we should try the anti-viral agents on the gel-packs.<br>
