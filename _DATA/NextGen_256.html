is in casual clothes) <br>
BARTENDER: (very hairy) So, tell me, why is it so important that you
find this man? <br>
TROI: We had business dealings. He owes me money. <br>
BARTENDER: If we had business dealings, I can tell you that I wouldn't
disappear. <br>
TROI: Maybe we can discuss that possibility. But first, I have to find
him, collect the money I'm owed. <br>
BARTENDER: I'll be closing in a few hours. Perhaps we can discuss this
more privately. <br>
TROI: If I don't find him, I'm going to have to move on. Are you sure
you haven't seen him? <br>
BARTENDER: Human, about two metres tall, smooth-headed. No. I don't
remember anyone like that. <br>
TROI: You're lying. <br>
BARTENDER: And you're a Betazoid. I thought so. Listen, people who come
in here, they count on a certain amount of anonymity. And if I were to
start answering questions about them, even to a very beautiful woman,
well, I wouldn't be in business very long. And being a businesswoman,
I'm sure you understand. <br>
(and he goes off to serve another customer while at the other end of
the bar) <br>
RIKER: Great story. I'll remember it next time I'm in a knife fight. <br>
(walks over to Worf) <br>
RIKER: Any luck? <br>
WORF: I think the one over there knows something. <br>
WORF: He would not admit to having seen the Captain, but he said that
anyone who visited the ruins of Nafir would probably come here
eventually. I suspect he knows more. <br>
RIKER: Let's go. <br>
WORF: Commander, I told <br>
RIKER: My friend tells me you know about the man we're looking for. <br>
YRANAC: The only reason I'm talking to you is that I have a sister,
too. <br>
WORF: I explained to him that we are looking for a man who impregnated
your sister. <br>
RIKER: So you can imagine how much this means to me. <br>
YRANAC: Family honour is important. If someone had defiled my sister I
would do anything, pay anything, to find the one responsible. <br>
RIKER: And how much might anything be? <br>
YRANAC: As much as five bars of gold-pressed latinum. <br>
BARTENDER: I think you've had a little too much to drink. You'd better
leave. On your way, Yranac. <br>
(the bartender gets a phaser jabbed into his cheekbone) <br>
CRUSHER: I'm sorry, but I think he wants to stay. Sit down. <br>
RIKER: This is my sister. She's angry. She's got a vicious temper. I
wouldn't cross her. <br>
BARTENDER: You say one word and you're a dead man. <br>
YRANAC: Perhaps there's an element of risk here that I did not fully
appreciate. <br>
WORF: And how much more latinum will it take to offset this risk? <br>
YRANAC: This isn't about latinum. As a man with a sister, a sister with
a temper, I can sympathise with you, but, how did you come here? Do you
have a ship in orbit? <br>
RIKER: Yes. <br>
YRANAC: Then take me with you. You can drop me anywhere. <br>
RIKER: Agreed. Now talk. <br>
YRANAC: The man you're looking for was here several weeks ago. There
was a group of aliens sitting at this table. He was asking them
questions. <br>
WORF: Who were these aliens? <br>
YRANAC: I don't know, but they looked dangerous. They attacked him. He
managed to incapacitate three of them before he was knocked down. He
was thrown against that wall and fell there. <br>
(Crusher scans it with her tricorder) <br>
CRUSHER: I'm picking up some Starfleet fibre traces and human cellular
debris. <br>
RIKER: Can you establish a DNA reading? <br>
CRUSHER: There's something strange here. The cell structures are badly
distorted. It's as if they've been exposed to some kind of high-energy
field. <br>
WORF: A weapon discharge? <br>
CRUSHER: It could be. I'm picking up some faint traces of
microcrystalline damage in the floor material, but I'm not familiar
with the pattern I'm getting. <br>
YRANAC: Who are you people? <br>
RIKER: You didn't say anything about a weapon. <br>
YRANAC: I hadn't finished yet. You'll like this. The man got what was
coming to him. When they knocked him down, one of them took out a
weapon and fired. He was vaporised. <br>
TROI: He's telling the truth.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Acting Captain's log, stardate 47135.2. Doctor
Crusher has positively identified Captain Picard's DNA. There's no
doubt now that he's dead. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Come. <br>
TROI: How are you doing? <br>
RIKER: I'm all right. <br>
TROI: The crew's pretty shaken up. I'm arranging a memorial. I think
you should be the one to deliver the eulogy. <br>
RIKER: I think you'd be better at something like that. Or Beverly. She
knew him the longest. <br>
TROI: I know it's not going to be easy, but I think it's important that
we face up to what's happened. You're in command now. The crew's
looking to you for guidance. <br>
RIKER: You don't understand. I can't give the eulogy because I won't be
at the service. <br>
TROI: A memorial service helps to give everyone a sense of completion.
Helps them begin the healing process. <br>
RIKER: That's exactly the point. I don't want to heal. <br>
TROI: Will. <br>
RIKER: I've an open wound, right here. It hurts like hell. I don't want
it to get better, and I don't want to pretend that everything's all
right. <br>
TROI: I know you're angry. <br>
RIKER: You're damn right! And I intend to stay angry until I find
whoever's responsible for the Captain's death. <br>
TROI: That's pretty selfish of you. Do you think you're the only one in
pain? Do you think you have the monopoly on loss? Well, let me tell you
something. We're all hurting, and we're all angry. And whether you like
it or not, you have a responsibility to this crew, and you can't just
indulge your personal desire for revenge. <br>
RIKER: That is enough, Counsellor. Deanna. I'm sorry. This is not about
revenge. This is about justice. The Captain died in a bar fight for
nothing. Somebody has to answer for that. Then I can mourn.

Admiral Chekote at Starbase two twenty seven. <br>
RIKER: I'll take it in the Ready room. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ready room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Sir. <br>
CHEKOTE [on monitor]: (not obviously a Native American) I read your
report, Commander. My condolences to you and your crew. Captain
Picard's death is a loss to the entire Federation. I see that you've
asked to postpone your mission to the Argus sector. For what reason? <br>
RIKER: I have a request, sir. I would like to conduct an investigation
into Captain Picard's death. <br>
CHEKOTE [on monitor]: The Dessican authorities have jurisdiction in
this case, Commander. <br>
RIKER: I know that, sir. Frankly, I don't have much confidence in the
authorities on Dessica Two. There's every reason to believe that
they're corrupt. <br>
CHEKOTE [on monitor]: I suspect you're right. The question remains, are
you the one to pursue this? <br>
RIKER: The Captain's death hit me pretty hard, and I may not be
completely objective, but there is no one who is more determined. I
won't rest until I find out who's responsible. <br>
CHEKOTE [on monitor]: All right, Commander. I'm officially placing the
Enterprise on detached duty. Your mission is at your discretion. Good
luck. <br>
RIKER: Thank you, sir.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Yranac's quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(the Yridian is eating from a large array of dishes
when Riker enters) <br>
YRANAC: Ah, Commander Riker. I've been meaning to speak to you. I was
wondering if you could move me to better quarters. I don't care much
for the decor here. <br>
RIKER: These are the best quarters we have. I was hoping now that
you've had a chance to relax you might have remembered some of the
details about the aliens you saw. Something you may have forgotten. <br>
YRANAC: Sorry, my memory isn't what it used to be. <br>
RIKER: They murdered a man in cold blood in full view of everyone in
the bar and you can't remember anything about them? <br>
YRANAC: Now that you mention it, I do remember one thing. They said
they'd kill anyone who talked about what happened. <br>
RIKER: Do you know where they went? (Yranac smiles) So you know who
they are and you know where I can find them. <br>
YRANAC: Perhaps I do. <br>
RIKER: What do you want? <br>
YRANAC: Not a great deal, Commander. Just a shuttlecraft. I believe I'd
like to travel for a while, see more of the galaxy. You understand. <br>
RIKER: A shuttlecraft? Well, here's my offer. Instead of the ship, I'll
give you some time. <br>
YRANAC: Time? <br>
RIKER: If you're lucky, you'll only spend the next five years in prison
instead of the next twenty. (picks him up by the lapels) You've got
twelve outstanding arrest warrants for fraud and petty theft in the
Klingon Empire. Tell me what you know, and I'll pull some strings.
Maybe they'll reduce your sentence after you've been extradited. <br>
YRANAC: If I tell you what I know, you must promise not to give me to
the Klingons. <br>
RIKER: I'll think about it. <br>
YRANAC: Perhaps you could send me to a Federation rehabilitation colony
instead. <br>
RIKER: Talk. <br>
YRANAC: The aliens were some kind of mercenary group. They've been
operating in this sector for the last six months. <br>
RIKER: Where do we find them? <br>
YRANAC: I heard one of them mention the Barradas system. I think they
were headed there. <br>
RIKER: You think? <br>
YRANAC: That's all I know. <br>
RIKER: Riker to Data. <br>
DATA [OC]: Data here. <br>
RIKER: Take us out of orbit. Set course for the Barradas system, warp
six. <br>
DATA [OC]: Aye, sir. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Observation lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Barradas Three is the only class M planet in
this system, and it is listed as unpopulated. However, sensors have
detected intermittent energy signals emanating from its surface. <br>
RIKER: What's the source? <br>
LAFORGE: The signals are difficult to localise, but they could be
emissions from some kind of power converter. <br>
WORF: Which could indicate a base or a ship. <br>
RIKER: What else do we know about Barradas Three? <br>
DATA: The planet was used as an outpost for the Debrune approximately
two thousand years ago. The Federation's Archaeological survey has
catalogued numerous ruins on the surface. <br>
RIKER: Mister Worf, I'd like a security detail to accompany the away
team to the surface. I'll lead the team. Geordi, you're with me. Mister
Data, you have the Bridge. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. Commander, as Acting First Officer, I must question
your decision to accompany the away team. If Captain Picard were here <br>
RIKER: He's not. <br>
DATA: I realise that, sir. But if he were, and he wanted to lead an
away team, you would tell him that the Captain's place is <br>
RIKER: On the Bridge. Not this time.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Ensign, you take that area. <br>
ENSIGN: Yes, sir. <br>
RIKER: Geordi? <br>
LAFORGE: It's tough to get accurate sensor readings. There's an awful
lot of interference in the area. <br>
RIKER: From what? <br>
LAFORGE: I'm not sure. It's very unlocalised. It could be atmospheric. <br>
RIKER: What do you make of these? <br>
(charred pits in the ground) <br>
LAFORGE: Well, these ruins around here are pretty ancient but I'd say
that this indentation was made fairly recently. Could be the site of
some battlefield. <br>
RIKER: It doesn't look like any blast point I've ever seen. The shape
is too perfect. <br>
LAFORGE: Sir, there's microcrystalline damage all throughout this area.
The same kind of pattern that Doctor Crusher picked up in the floor of
that bar on Dessica Two. <br>
WORF: Commander! I found something. <br>
(a pottery urn and other things in the sand) <br>
RIKER: Looks as if someone could have just dropped them. <br>

incessant energy weapons) <br>

leaving orbit. <br>
DATA: Why was it not detected earlier? <br>
GIUSTI: They could have been using the planet as a shield. Sir, they
are powering up their weapon systems. <br>
DATA: Raise shields. Red alert. <br>
(the little ship strafes the Enterprise as it passes) <br>
DATA: Damage report. <br>
GIUSTI: Minor hit on the port deflector. No damage. They're running,
sir. Their speed is warp eight point seven and holding. I think they're
at their maximum. <br>
DATA: Take us to warp nine and pursue. Lock phasers on target. <br>
GIUSTI: Sir, we should be within phaser range in twenty three seconds.
Switching to long-range scanners. Commander, the sensor image of that
ship is extremely weak. It's fading. The ship doesn't register on the
long-range sensors. I'm sorry, sir. We've lost them. <br>
DATA: Increase the sensor field bandwidth. Patch in the lateral sensor
arrays. <br>
GIUSTI: It's no good, the signal's gone. It just disappeared. <br>
DATA: Plot a course and take us back to Barradas Three. Notify the away

GIUSTI: Aye, sir. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Observation lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Starfleet Intelligence confirms that a ship
matching this configuration has been linked to raids on several other
planets in this sector. For the short time it was within our visual
range, we were able to take sensor readings of the mercenary vessel. It
appears to be encased in an energy absorbing material. Although we can
see the ship, this energy sheath renders it virtually undetectable to
our long range sensors. <br>
TROI: There must be some way we can track it. <br>
LAFORGE: Data, I know this is a long shot, but if I remodulate the long
range sensor array, I might be able to make it sensitive enough to
detect the ship. <br>
DATA: Without a full compositional analysis of the energy sheath, the
chances of finding the correct remodulation sequence are remote. <br>
WORF: Sir, they have taken Commander Riker. We must do something. We
cannot just sit here. <br>
DATA: On the contrary, Lieutenant. That is precisely what we must do.
Since there are no viable alternatives, we will return to the surface
and attempt to determine what these mercenaries are doing on this
planet. An investigation might reveal some indication of their purpose.
Please notify me when you have assembled your search teams. Dismissed. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BARAN: (vaguely leonine) What's the problem? <br>
NARIK: (more spiky, Harper-esque) I warned you not to push the engines
so hard. Two of the power shunts are on the verge of collapse. We'll be
lucky if we can maintain warp six. <br>
BARAN: How long will it take to repair? <br>
NARIK: I can try to realign the warp core. It'll take at least eleven
hours, but I'll have to shut the engines down completely. <br>
BARAN: We're not stopping. We can't afford to be sitting helpless in
space. I want warp eight available in five hours, and I don't want to
hear your excuses. <br>
(Narik goes to his console) <br>
BARAN: What were you doing on Barradas Three? <br>
RIKER: William T. Riker, Commander, SC two three one dash four two
seven. <br>
BARAN: Oh really? Well, I am Arctus Baran and I don't have a number.
Now what were you doing on Barradas Three, Commander? <br>
RIKER: We were studying the ruins. It was a scientific expedition. <br>
BARAN: Don't patronise me. Those ruins have been studied for centuries.
There's nothing new to learn from them. <br>
RIKER: Then what were you doing there? <br>
(Baran presses a device on his belt, and a gizmo on Riker's neck sends
him to his knees in pain) <br>
BARAN: Don't bother, Commander, you can't remove it. It's a neural
servo connected directly to your nervous system. It lets me control
precisely how much pain you feel. This setting is usually sufficient.
However, if necessary, it can go much higher. These devices were the
idea of my predecessor. It's a convenient way of enforcing discipline. <br>
RIKER: What happened to him? <br>
BARAN: He failed to enforce it with me. <br>
VEKOR: (red-head female alien) This is a waste of time, Baran. Get rid
of him now. <br>
BARAN: You should be more patient, Vekor. It might be rewarding. We
will wait. Let the memory of his pain argue with him for a while. It
might change his attitude. <br>
(the Romulan woman takes Riker out of the way) <br>
NARIK: Vekor is right. We should get rid of him. It's dangerous to have
someone from Starfleet on board. <br>
BARAN: Dangerous? It might be profitable. A Starfleet Commander is a
valuable hostage. <br>
VEKOR: Starfleet won't negotiate with us, but they'll pursue us as long
as we have him. <br>
(she gets a zap of pain) <br>
BARAN: This discussion is over. Get back to your post, Vekor. <br>
(a smooth-headed human turns to face the camera) <br>
PICARD: They're right, Baran, and you know it. I say kill him. Now. <br>
(Riker looks round, aghast) <br>
PICARD: If he has nothing to give us, we should kill him now and be
done with it. Everyone seems to recognise that fact except you. <br>
BARAN: I don't need a consensus to run this ship, Galen. <br>
(the lights go down) <br>
BARAN: What's going on? <br>
NARIK: I'm bypassing the aft plasma couplings. The power loss should
only last for a few seconds. <br>
BARAN: You should learn not to limit your options. Riker could be very
useful to us in the future. <br>
PICARD: He may not be as useful as you think, if this is the same Riker
that I've heard about. <br>
RIKER: And what Riker might that be? <br>
PICARD: Commander of the Enterprise formerly assigned to the USS Hood. <br>
RIKER: That's right. <br>
PICARD: Then you must be the William T. Riker with a history of
insubordination. He was even once relieved of duty, during the
Cardassian incident at Minos Korva. <br>
BARAN: How do you know all this? <br>
PICARD: Look, I've been smuggling artefacts from Federation sites for
years. You can't help developing a familiarity with certain Starfleet
personnel. If we hadn't have captured him, he'd probably have ended up
before a court martial. <br>
RIKER: I've gotten out of them before. <br>
PICARD: Look, he's no use to us. Finish him now. Let me do it for you. <br>
(the ship jerks and rushes into warp) <br>
TALLERA: (to another female) Watch him. <br>
VEKOR: We're accelerating. <br>
BARAN: What have you done? <br>
NARIK: It has nothing to do with my repairs. I think there's a
malfunction in the engine's intermix chamber. <br>
TALLERA: Plasma pressure is rising. <br>
BARAN: Where's the malfunction? <br>
NARIK: It could be one of any thirty subsystems. It'll take time to
locate. <br>
TALLERA: I don't think you're going to have the chance. Plasma pressure
has reached critical levels. <br>
BARAN: Seal off the intermix chamber. <br>
VEKOR: I can't. The override sequence won't engage. <br>
PICARD: The antimatter flow regulator is locked open. <br>
TALLERA: Logic subsystems still not responding. <br>
BARAN: (pushing Picard aside) Get out of the way. <br>
TALLERA: Plasma pressure has exceeded maximum levels. Eight percent
above critical and rising. <br>
NARIK: We have to jettison the core. <br>
BARAN: No, we'll be stranded here. <br>
PICARD: The flow regulator is frozen. <br>
RIKER: Let me do it. I've had a lot of experience with this sort of
system failures. I might be able to do something. <br>
TALLERA: Plasma pressure is eleven percent above critical. The
containment fields are beginning to degrade. <br>
BARAN: Go! <br>
NARIK: Flow regulator is not responding to manual override. Containment
fields won't hold much longer. <br>
RIKER: Looks like you've got a control logic lockout in your regulator
subsystem. I'm going to attempt to run an active
bypass through the plasma flow convertor. You, (Narik) start running
phase-lock feedback through that regulator. I want about a six second
delay. <br>
NARIK: What are you saying? I don't take orders from you. <br>
BARAN: You do as he says. <br>
TALLERA: Plasma pressure is fourteen percent above critical. <br>
BARAN: If you fail <br>
RIKER: We'll all be dead anyway. Just need a few more seconds. <br>
TALLERA: Plasma pressure is dropping. We're back into safe levels. <br>
RIKER: If you want to make sure that doesn't happen again, you'd better
re-initiate your regulator sub-compressors. A full diagnostic of your
intermix chamber wouldn't hurt either. <br>
BARAN: Do it. Put him in quarters for now. <br>

that's particularly valuable. Why would anyone want to steal any of
these things? <br>
DATA: Perhaps these artefacts have a special value to the Romulans. <br>
WORF: The Romulans? <br>
DATA: These structures were built by the Debrune. That race is an
ancient offshoot of the Romulans. The ruins on the planet where Captain
Picard was killed were also Romulan in origin. <br>
WORF: The leader of the group that attacked us was Romulan. Perhaps
they are controlling the mercenaries. <br>
DATA: The question remains, why are they stealing these artefacts?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: There are several archaeological sites in
this sector containing ruins which are Romulan in origin. These are the
locations that were attacked by the mercenary vessel. <br>
LAFORGE: Looks like they did a pretty thorough job. <br>
DATA: The only sites not been attacked were on Calder Two, Yadalla
Prime, and Draken Four. <br>
LAFORGE: Yadalla and Draken are at the far edge of the sector, but
Calder Two? That's less than a day from here at
maximum warp. <br>
DATA: That would be their next likely target. <br>
LAFORGE: According to this, there's a Federation outpost at Calder Two.
<br>
DATA: But it is only a small science station. It has limited defensive
capabilities. I do not believe it could withstand an attack from the
mercenary ship. Mister Worf. Send a message to the Federation outpost
on Calder Two. Advise them that if a ship matching the mercenary vessel
approaches, they should attempt to delay it until our arrival. Ensign,
take us out of orbit. Set course for the Calder system. Warp nine. <br>
ENSIGN: (male) Aye, sir.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: We don't have much time. It's good to see
you, Will. I didn't expect to meet you here. <br>
RIKER: I was looking to find the people who killed you on the surface.
A witness said they saw you vaporised. <br>
PICARD: These mercenaries use weapons that can activate their
transporter. It gives them the opportunity to beam things quickly, just
by firing at them. That's what they did to me. <br>
RIKER: I don't understand any of this. Who are these people? What are
you doing involved with them? <br>
PICARD: The site that I wanted to study had been raided. A lot of the
artefacts had been stolen. The site had been practically destroyed. I
wanted to find out who was responsible. I tracked them to that bar on
Dessica Two. I must have asked too many questions. They captured me.
They wanted to find out how much I knew about their operation. <br>
RIKER: And then you became part of their crew? <br>
PICARD: I convinced them I was a smuggler, and that my name was Galen.
I offered to help them appraise the artefacts that they had stolen.
Will, these aren't common thieves. They are stealing Romulan artefacts
from archaeological sites throughout this sector. Baran has me
analysing each one if them for a particular particle signature. Will,
they are looking for a specific artefact. <br>
RIKER: Why? <br>
PICARD: That's what we have to find out. Baran is the key. I think that
he knows more about what we're really looking for than anyone else on
this ship. I want you to get close to him. Try and get his confidence. <br>
RIKER: That's why you set up the engine failure, because you knew that
I'd be able to fix it. <br>
PICARD: He also believes that you're a less than perfect Starfleet
officer. Will, I want you to play into that role. Baran and I, well, he
doesn't care very much for me, but he has to tolerate me because he
needs my help with these artefacts. But if you and I become enemies,
then there's a better chance of you and he becoming friends. <br>
RIKER: All right. I'll do what I can. <br>
(Baran enters, Picard hits Riker) <br>
BARAN: What are you doing here? <br>
PICARD: Getting some answers, because you can't get him to talk. <br>
(Baran punishes Picard) <br>
BARAN: No one conducts an interrogation on this ship without my
permission. Is that understood? <br>
(Picard walks to the door, keeping eye contact with Baran all the time,
and kicks Riker for good measure)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BARAN: Our next objective should prove an
interesting challenge. We're headed for the Sakethan burial mounds on
Calder Two. <br>
PICARD: What? Calder Two isn't just another archaeological site, you
know. It's a Federation outpost there. <br>
BARAN: I don't see that as a problem. <br>
PICARD: It's defended by Starfleet. You don't think they're just going
to stand by while we walk in there and take whatever we want. <br>
BARAN: I'm familiar with the tactical situation. <br>
VEKOR: What are their defences? <br>
BARAN: Nothing to worry about. They have a type four deflector shield
protecting the outpost and the ruins. <br>
PICARD: They also have a minimum of two phaser banks and possibly
photon torpedoes. Is that enough to worry about? <br>
TALLERA: How do you know so much about this outpost? <br>
PICARD: Because I tried to smuggle a Sakethan glyph stone out of there
nearly two years ago. I barely got away in one piece. <br>
BARAN: Our weapons are more than a match for their defences. I
anticipate that we'll be able to destroy the outpost within fifteen
minutes. Then we'll send in Tallera and the landing party to secure the
relics. <br>
PICARD: Why don't we use Riker? He's a Starfleet Commander. He could
talk us past the outpost security without raising their suspicions.
Then when their shields go down, we can beam the artefacts up here
without ever leaving the ship. <br>
VEKOR: Why would Riker help us? Just because he's out of favour with
Starfleet doesn't mean that he's ready to betray them. <br>
PICARD: If he doesn't help us, we'll have to destroy the outpost and
kill everyone on it. He's still a Starfleet officer. He won't want to
take innocent lives if he can possibly prevent it. <br>
TALLERA: The last time we engaged Starfleet, we lost a man. We can't
afford any more casualties. If we can avoid a battle, I think we
should. <br>
BARAN: All right, we'll try it. We'll be at Calder Two within five
hours. You all know your duties. I want this ship prepared for battle,
in case your plan doesn't work.

within specified reference range. Probability of match zero point zero
four percent. <br>

PICARD: Access spectral analysis, mode two, begin scan. <br>
TALLERA: Baran wants to see the analysis of the last lot. He thinks
you're moving a little slowly. <br>
PICARD: You can tell Baran if he wants the analysis done faster, he can
do it himself. If he wants it done correctly, he can wait. <br>
TALLERA: Do you enjoy living dangerously, Galen? Baran can kill you in
an instant if he activates his control device. <br>
PICARD: I doubt that he'll do that. I've increased the accuracy of the
identification process by a factor of ten. I'm the best person to
analyse these artefacts. Baran knows that. <br>
TALLERA: He may need you now, but I know Baran, and I can tell you he's
not going to back down forever. You accomplish nothing by provoking
him. <br>
PICARD: I don't like operating in the dark. If I knew what the point of
this mission were, why I was analysing these relics. <br>
TALLERA: If Baran felt it were wise to let the crew know that, I'm sure
he would have. <br>
PICARD: Do you know what all this is about? <br>
TALLERA: What Baran knows, I know. <br>
PICARD: Then what's going on here. Why are we risking our lives taking
these artefacts? Who wants them? <br>
TALLERA: I see no reason to tell you anything, but you can rest assured
I don't necessarily share everything I know with Baran, either. This
conversation, for example, will stay between us. <br>
PICARD: You can tell Baran every word that I've said. He knows that I
don't think much of him as a leader. <br>
TALLERA: He's been in charge of this crew for a long time. <br>
PICARD: Baran wouldn't last five minutes as captain if he didn't have
that control device. The crew follow him because they have no choice.
Baran's power is based on fear and intimidation. <br>
TALLERA: That almost sounds like a prelude to mutiny. <br>
PICARD: If someone were to challenge him, the rest of the crew would
follow. <br>
TALLERA: I was right. You do like living dangerously. I like you,
Galen. I can tolerate a lot from someone like you, but only to a point.
I intend to complete this mission successfully and get what's been
promised me. If it looks as though you're getting in the way of that,
I'll deal with you myself.
