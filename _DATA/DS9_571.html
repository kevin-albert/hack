O'BRIEN: Basically we stumbled onto it by accident. At Chin'toka, our
entire fleet was disabled when the Breen engaged their energy dampening
weapon. Three hundred and eleven ships, Federation, Romulan, and
Klingon, all lost power. <br>
SISKO: But one didn't. A Bird of Prey called the Ki'tang. <br>
ROSS: Why? What was different about the Ki'tang? <br>
O'BRIEN: We're not really sure. The only thing we can figure is that
just prior to the engagement, their Chief Engineer adjusted the tritium
intermix to compensate for a containment problem in the warp core. <br>
MARTOK: I've ordered every ship in the Klingon fleet to adjust its
reactor the same way. <br>
ROMULAN: Our vessels are of a different design. Can this technique be
adapted to protect them as well? <br>
SISKO: Unfortunately, no. Your ships are still vulnerable, and so are
ours. <br>
O'BRIEN: I've sent everything we know about the Breen weapon to the
Romulan Ministry of Science and to Starfleet Engineering, but
realistically, it's going take be a while before they can figure out a
way to protect our ships. <br>
SISKO: Thank you, Mister O'Brien. <br>
(O'Brien leaves.) <br>
ROSS: Well, gentlemen, it seems as if the Klingon fleet is the only
thing that stands between us and the Dominion. <br>
ROMULAN: What have we come to? <br>
MARTOK: By tomorrow, we'll have fifteen hundred Klingon vessels ready
for deployment. <br>
ROMULAN: With the Breen, the Cardassians and the Jem'Hadar, you're
still outnumbered twenty to one. <br>
MARTOK: I am aware of that, General. <br>
SISKO: Obviously the Klingons can't go head to head with the Dominion,
but they may be able to keep them distracted. <br>
MARTOK: We'll operate in small battle groups, going in under cloak,
engaging the enemy, and trying to provoke them into pursuit. <br>
SISKO: With any luck, they'll be able to keep the Dominion off balance
and prevent them from launching an offensive. <br>
ROMULAN: For how long? They can't keep them at bay forever. <br>
SISKO: No, they can't. But fortunately we're not the only ones the
Dominion has to contend with right now. <br>
ROSS: Damar's resistance movement. <br>
ROMULAN: What's left of them. Half his troops were killed in their
assault on Rondac. <br>
SISKO: They may have failed to capture Rondac, but their attack sent a
message to the Cardassian people. If the rebels can show them that they
have a chance of succeeding, their support will grow. <br>
ROMULAN: Does the rebellion have a chance of succeeding? <br>
SISKO: Yes, but they have to adjust their tactics. Concentrate on small
scale hit and run attacks, sabotaging key facilities. <br>
ROSS: Damar's a by the book soldier. Does he have any experience waging
this kind of campaign? <br>
SISKO: No, he doesn't. Which is why we have to send him someone who
does. </font></p>

teach a bunch of Cardassians how to be resistance fighters? <br>
SISKO: I'm aware of the irony. But the tactics you used to drive the
Cardassians off Bajor are exactly what the situation calls for. <br>
KIRA: But to work with Damar? When he killed Ziyal, he murdered an
innocent girl that I considered a part of my family. <br>
SISKO: You're going to have to put your personal feelings aside.
Whether you like Damar or not is irrelevant. We need him. The Dominion
knows they have to stop his rebellion before it spreads, and it's up to
you to see that they don't. It's as simple as that. <br>
KIRA: Yes, sir. I understand that Damar and his men went into hiding
after the attack on Rondac. Any idea how to locate them? <br>
SISKO: I suggest you talk to Mister Garak about that. <br>
KIRA: Garak? <br>
SISKO: He still has contacts on Cardassia. If I were you, I'd ask him
to join your team. He could be useful. <br>
KIRA: Damar and Garak. It should be an interesting mission. </font></p>

synthetic organs on hand in a battlefield situation. You never know how
many livers you're going to need, or how many hearts. <br>
ODO: I can imagine. But what does that have to do with me? <br>
BASHIR: Well, the Holy Grail of organ replacement is to be able to find
a way to inject the patient with undifferentiated tissue so that can
become whatever organ is needed. The only problem is <br>
ODO: Doctor, get to the point. <br>
BASHIR: I need to borrow a cup of goo. <br>
ODO: Excuse me? <br>
BASHIR: Please? I'll give it back. You see, I need to study your
morphogenic matrix so that I can synthesise organic tissue that can
change form the way your cells do. <br>
ODO: To use for organ replacement. <br>
BASHIR: Exactly. <br>
ODO: Can't you just scan me or something? <br>
BASHIR: I need a sample. It's for a good cause. <br>
ODO: All right, Doctor. <br>
(Odo puts his finger into the beaker and pours off part of himself.) <br>
BASHIR: Just a tad more. Thank you. <br>
ODO: I'm going to want that back as soon as Kira and I return from our
mission. <br>
BASHIR: Oh, you're going with her? <br>
ODO: She thought I might be useful. <br>
BASHIR: When do you leave? <br>

WINN: How like a Cardassian to find amusement in an old man's death.
You don't know how much I regret having to kill him. <br>
DUKAT: He was going to expose us. No one can be allowed to stand in our

WINN: Remember your place, Dukat. <br>
DUKAT: I thought my place was in your bed. <br>
WINN: That was before I knew who you were. <br>
DUKAT: Adami, I'm not the same man I was during the occupation. The Pah
wraiths have changed me. <br>
WINN: But they can't change what you did. Do you really think I could
let myself be touched by a man whose hands are stained with the blood
of my people? <br>
DUKAT: When we so release the Pah wraiths from the fire caves, your
hands will be stained as well. <br>
WINN: The Pah wraiths will spare those whom they find worthy. The rest
are of no consequence. <br>

SISKO: In the morning. <br>
ROSS: Martok seems a little nervous about the ceremony. <br>
SISKO: Chancellor Gowron is travelling all the way from Kronos to
induct him into the Order of Kahless. I'd be nervous, too. <br>
(Doorbell.) <br>
SISKO: Come in. <br>
KIRA: Good news. Garak was able to contact Damar. <br>
GARAK: He's provided us with his location and has requested assistance
as soon as possible. <br>
KIRA: So with your permission, I'd like to depart first thing tomorrow.
<br>
SISKO: By all means. <br>
GARAK: There is one other thing. <br>
SISKO: Yes, Mister Garak? <br>
GARAK: Damar expressed concern when I told him that Colonel Kira would
be leading this mission. <br>
KIRA: Well if he wants to defeat the Dominion he's going to have to put
his personal feelings aside. <br>
GARAK: He's certainly willing to do that. He knows the value of your
skills. Damar is concerned that his men will see your uniform as an
affront. We Cardassians are a proud people. Losing Bajor to a ragtag
band of terrorists, no offence, was a humiliation. Simply put, taking
on a Bajoran officer as an advisor would undermine his authority. <br>
ROSS: I'm sorry, Colonel. We'll have to find someone else to head up
the mission. <br>
SISKO: No, sir. Colonel Kira is the best person for the job. There's
another way around this problem.

KIRA: A Bajoran with the authority to speak on behalf of the
Federation. <br>
GARAK: You realise you're going to have to do something about your
uniform as well? <br>
ODO: I was afraid you were going to say that. (He morphs into civilian
clothes.) Well? <br>
GARAK: It's a little drab. <br>
ODO: This is how I appeared when I worked for the Cardassians. <br>
GARAK: Ah, well, it should put them at ease, anyway. I wonder if Doctor
Bashir could help us with that nose of yours? <br>
KIRA: I'm only willing to go so far. Damar's men are just going to have
to get used to the idea of having me around. <br>

RUSOT: Federation food replicators? <br>
DAMAR: We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes
from. <br>
RUSOT: Taking help from the Federation is bad enough, but having to
take it from that Bajoran terrorist. <br>
DAMAR: Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills
we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. <br>
RUSOT: I can't believe what I'm hearing. When we were stationed on
Terok Nor, you used spent hours telling me how much you despised her. <br>

neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend.

KIRA: Yes, it has. <br>
RUSOT: Did you bring the supplies we requested? <br>
ODO: Food replicators, weapons. I think you'll find everything you
asked for. <br>
DAMAR: Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's
generosity. <br>
GARAK: How nice. And now that the formalities are over with, let's try
to remember that our enemy is the Dominion, and not each other. <br>
RUSOT: I don't need to be reminded of who my enemies are. <br>
(Later, at the briefing.) <br>
KIRA: A Resistance organisation is structured into cells, autonomous
groups of ten to twenty people. That way if anyone gets captured, their
ability to compromise the organisation is limited. They can't be forced
to name names that they don't know. <br>
GARAK: The Obsidian Order worked the same way. <br>
KIRA: We have to decentralise your operation. Having all your men in
one place is just too risky. <br>
RUSOT: If we scatter our resources, we won't be able to defend
ourselves against a Dominion assault. <br>
KIRA: And if you stay in one place, they can wipe out your entire
Resistance movement in one attack. Smaller groups are safer. They're
harder to track down. <br>
DAMAR: I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases.
<br>
KIRA: Good. Now, Odo and Garak have been looking over your intelligence
reports and they came up with a list of vulnerable facilities for us to
target. <br>
ODO: The weapons depot on Adarak Prime is protected by only a single
garrison and there's a weakness in their perimeter defences. A small
group could infiltrate the compound and <br>
RUSOT: Adarak Prime is defended by a Cardassian garrison. <br>
ODO: That's correct. <br>
SESKAL: You expect us to attack our own people? <br>
KIRA: If necessary, yes. <br>
RUSOT: That's out of the question. <br>
DAMAR: I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the
Jem'Hadar and the Breen. <br>
KIRA: Believe me, I understand how you feel. During the occupation, I
didn't want to attack any facility that had a Bajoran working in it.
But I did it. Because they were collaborators. They were working with
the enemy. <br>
RUSOT: We're not Bajorans. We don't kill our own. <br>
KIRA: Well then you might as well just give up right now. Because the
minute that the Dominion realises that you will not attack your own
people, they will station a Cardassian at every base they have. <br>
ODO: She's right. The Founders won't hesitate to play your own people
against you. <br>
KIRA: Anyone who's not fighting with you, is fighting against you. <br>
DAMAR: You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. <br>
RUSOT: Damar. <br>
DAMAR: Not another word, Rusot. Continue. <br>
ODO: We would need to disable the garrison's security protocols. <br>
GARAK: I believe that's where I step in.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: I'd loved to have seen Hilliard's face when
he realised Captain Sisko had Sigma Nine clearance. <br>
O'BRIEN: So, is the file worth all the trouble you had to go through? <br>
BASHIR: There's more data here than I expected. Starfleet Medical
certainly were thorough. <br>
O'BRIEN: By the way, what happened with you and Ezri? <br>
BASHIR: Don't ask. <br>
O'BRIEN: Go on. <br>
BASHIR: Actually, she got involved with Worf. <br>
O'BRIEN: What? She told you that? <br>
BASHIR: Well, not in so many words. <br>
O'BRIEN: Julian, I had a drink with Worf the other day. He told me that
he and Ezri were just friends. You must have misunderstood her. <br>
BASHIR: I suppose it's possible. I mean, she didn't exactly come out
and say it. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well did you at least find out why she's been avoiding you? <br>
BASHIR: No. That's odd. <br>
O'BRIEN: What? <br>
BASHIR: The dispersal pattern in this resonance scan. I've seen it
before. <br>
O'BRIEN: What do you mean? <br>
BASHIR: When I first came to the station, I had to familiarise myself
with Odo's physiology. Doctor Mora was kind enough to share his data
with me. This looks like the scan he did when he first found Odo. <br>
O'BRIEN: Are you sure? There's a lot of numbers there. <br>
BASHIR: I saw it with my own eyes not seven years ago. <br>
O'BRIEN: You really are genetically enhanced, aren't you. <br>
BASHIR: According to the date, this scan was done when Odo was at
Starfleet Medical. <br>
O'BRIEN: Two different scans can't have exactly the same dispersal
pattern? <br>
BASHIR: It's impossible. Someone took Mora's results and built up a
phony medical workup around them. This isn't Odo's file. They sent a
fake. <br>
O'BRIEN: I can't believe Starfleet Medical would actually make up a
fake file just to throw you off. <br>
BASHIR: You're right. It isn't something Starfleet Medical would do. <br>
O'BRIEN: Are you thinking what I'm thinking? <br>
BASHIR: Section Thirty One. <br>
O'BRIEN: An organisation that's prepared to do whatever it takes to
protect the Federation wouldn't even blink at doing something like
this. <br>
BASHIR: They don't want me to find a cure. They're afraid the Founders
will get hold of it. <br>
O'BRIEN: And to keep that from happening, they're willing to let Odo
die. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARTOK: First he gives me a medal, then he takes
over my command. It makes no sense. <br>
WORF: Our people have come to see you as a saviour of the Empire. That
is something Gowron cannot tolerate. He wants to be its saviour. <br>
MARTOK: What's he afraid of? That I'm going to challenge his position?
I have no interest in politics. I'm a soldier. By the hand of Kahless.
I've earned my position. I've risen through the ranks, fought countless
battles. What has he done? Schemed and plotted his way to power. <br>
WORF: His military experience is limited. He is not half the tactician
you are. <br>
MARTOK: Many brave warriors have given their lives in this war. (sigh)
Whatever Gowron's motives are, it is our duty to help him defeat the
Dominion. We owe it to our fallen comrades. <br>
WORF: I am honoured to be part of your House. <br>
MARTOK: Well, I had better gather my things. This office belongs to
Gowron now. </font></p>

ODO: How's the food? <br>
KIRA: Replicated. <br>
SESKAL: Are you going to ask him or not? <br>
GARAK: I wouldn't recommend it. <br>
SESKAL: It's a legitimate question, Garak. <br>
GARAK: Maybe. I just don't think it's a proper subject for discussion,
not if we're all supposed to be getting along. <br>
SESKAL: Well, if you won't ask him, I will. Odo, when you were the Head
of Security on Terok Nor, what did you think was going to happen to the
Bajoran prisoners you arrested? <br>
KIRA: You don't have to answer that. <br>
RUSOT: Why not? It's a legitimate question. <br>
KIRA: If you want to provoke an argument. <br>
GARAK: Just as I said. <br>
ODO: I expected that my prisoners would be dealt with justly, but I
soon came to realize that Cardassians had little interest in justice. <br>
SESKAL: Ah. Well then, why didn't you resign in protest? <br>
(Kira throws her plate across the room.) <br>
KIRA: What are you getting at? <br>
ODO: Nerys, don't. <br>
RUSOT: I believe you've struck a nerve. Apparently, Commander Kira
doesn't like to be reminded that her lover collaborated with her
enemies. <br>
KIRA: Odo wasn't a collaborator. <br>
RUSOT: I suppose that depends on your definition of collaborator. <br>
ODO: Nerys, it isn't worth it. <br>
GARAK: Odo's right, Commander. <br>
KIRA: I guess we have a difference of opinion. <br>
(Kira walks away, and Odo follows her.) <br>
GARAK: You don't know how lucky you are. <br>
RUSOT: Oh? Why's that? <br>
GARAK: She would have killed you. <br>
RUSOT: I only wish she had tried. <br>
(Kira and Odo reach a sleeping area. Kira kicks over some convenient
barrels.) <br>
ODO: I'm glad we're in agreement. <br>
KIRA: You want to knock over some supplies, be my guest. <br>
ODO: You did the right thing, Nerys. The Dominion is our enemy, not
Rusot. <br>
KIRA: I don't need you to remind me of that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's
just so hot in here. <br>
ODO: Cardassians do love the heat. <br>
KIRA: I don't. I'm going to go see if I can find a cooling unit. <br>
ODO: I'll come with you. <br>
KIRA: It's all right. I promise I won't hit anyone. <br>
ODO: I'll hold you to that. <br>
(Kira leaves. Odo starts to pick up a barrel and notices some dry
'skin' on his hand. After the break he morphs it away just before Kira
returns.) <br>
KIRA: You're not going to believe this. <br>
ODO: Believe what? <br>
KIRA: Damar actually had a cooling unit waiting for us. What's wrong? <br>
ODO: Nothing. I was just worried that you might have had another run in
with Rusot. <br>
KIRA: Don't worry. I'm going to keep a cool head. Assuming of course I
can get this thing to work. </font></p>

DUKAT: Adami? Are you there? <br>
WINN: I'm here. I spoke with the doctor. She said she can find nothing
wrong with your eyes. <br>
DUKAT: Then she's incompetent! A Cardassian doctor would've cured me by
now. <br>
WINN: You still don't understand, do you? The Pah wraiths have taken
your sight in punishment for your arrogance. Only they can give it back
to you. <br>
DUKAT: I meant them no disrespect. I only wanted to study the book to
see if I could help you learn how to release them. <br>
WINN: You wanted to see if you could do it without me. Well, you can't.
<br>
DUKAT: Pray with me, Adami. Help me earn the Pah wraiths' forgiveness. <br>
WINN: I'm afraid you'll have to do that on your own. (doorbell) Door.
Deputy Bodan will show you out. <br>
DUKAT: Show me out? I don't understand. <br>
WINN: You need a lesson in humility. I'm going to see that you get it. <br>
DUKAT: By putting me out on the street? <br>
WINN: You'll find the Bajoran people are very kind. A blind beggar will
elicit their sympathies, I'm certain. And with any luck, you'll earn
enough to eat and perhaps even enough for shelter each night. <br>
DUKAT: You're not serious. <br>
WINN: You may return when you've proved yourself worthy and your sight

MARTOK: Of course. <br>
GOWRON: Come. The Dominion is deploying their fleet in preparation for
a final offensive. They're destroying our ships one by one. <br>
WORF: We must hold the line until the Federation and Romulan fleets
become operational again. <br>
GOWRON: No. Don't you see? That's exactly what the enemy is expecting.
The time to act is now. <br>
MARTOK: What are you proposing, Chancellor? <br>
GOWRON: We're going on the offensive. Starting tomorrow, I'm sending
sorties deep into enemy territory to strike at the very heart of the
Dominion! <br>
MARTOK: But we are barely holding the line as it is. <br>
WORF: We need every ship we have to defend the border. <br>
GOWRON: What's wrong with you two? Don't you understand? We must seize
the day! <br>
MARTOK: We are outnumbered twenty to one. <br>
GOWRON: What of it? The element of surprise will be on our side. <br>
MARTOK: Chancellor, in my opinion <br>
GOWRON: Did I ask your opinion? Trust me, my friends. I can see it all
so clearly. While our allies sit and do nothing, the Klingon Empire
will score the final triumph over the Dominion. We'll be the saviours
of the Alpha Quadrant. The glory will be ours and ours alone.

One is involved in this, maybe we should tell the Captain. <br>
BASHIR: We've been over this, Miles. If we tell him, he'll have to
report it to Starfleet Command. Thirty One'll certainly get wind of it
and once they realise we figured out the files are fake, they'll take
steps to make sure we don't find a cure. <br>

(Quark enters carrying a tray with mugs on.) <br>
QUARK: Excuse me, gentlemen. <br>
O'BRIEN: Is that coffee? <br>
QUARK: I figured you were probably working on a way to help Odo. I
thought this is the least I could do. <br>
BASHIR: How did you know Odo was ill? <br>
QUARK: I hear things. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yeah, well keep it under your hat, will you? <br>
QUARK: Why? <br>
O'BRIEN: Just do it. <br>

O'BRIEN: Here you go. <br>
BASHIR: Hang on, hang on, I'm just trying to figure out when Odo became
infected. I analysed the sample he left and mapped out the life cycle
of the virus. I'm programming the computer to calculate just how long
it took for the virus to achieve its present level of concentration. <br>
O'BRIEN: That makes sense. According to that, he was infected over two
years ago? <br>
BASHIR: More than that. I just don't understand. I assumed he became
infected when he Linked with the female shape-shifter. <br>
O'BRIEN: But if it happened that long ago, how come he hasn't shown any
symptoms before? <br>
BASHIR: Good question. Got it. Stardate four nine four one nine. <br>
O'BRIEN: Almost three years ago. <br>
BASHIR: Wait a minute. Four nine four one nine. That's the day that Odo
was at Starfleet Medical. <br>
O'BRIEN: You sure? <br>
BASHIR: Yes. My god. No wonder Hilliard wouldn't let me see the file.
Section Thirty one must have created the virus, infected Odo, and then
used him as a carrier. <br>
O'BRIEN: So that when he Linked with another changeling, he'd pass it
on, and eventually the entire race would be infected. <br>
BASHIR: Thirty one isn't just trying to stop us from finding a cure.
They're trying to cover up the fact that they set out to commit
genocide. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well if they gave Odo this disease, then they must have a
cure. <br>
BASHIR: We have to find a way to get our hands on that cure. <br>
