You wanted to see me? <br>
EMH: I'd like to request a temporary leave of absence. You remember the
Ovions? <br>
CHAKOTAY: The hexapods. <br>
EMH: They just asked me to speak at a Symposium on spaceborne
pathogens.
There are going to be physicians from all over the Quadrant. This is a
rare opportunity for me. And for the rest of the crew. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How's that? <br>
EMH: I'd be representing Voyager. Putting our best foot forward, so to
speak. And, needless to say hexapods are more likely to know a best
foot when they see one. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm sorry, Doctor. It's just not practical. <br>
EMH: I seem to recall Lieutenant Torres participating in Boray
Conference on transwarp theory a few months back. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That was different. <br>
EMH: How? <br>
CHAKOTAY: We were there. The Ovion system is two weeks behind us. I
can't ask the captain to turn the ship around. <br>
EMH: I could take a shuttle. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You could also write a paper and submit it on subspace. <br>
EMH: That's hardly an effective means of making a presentation. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Say you do take a shuttle. Would you expect us to sit here
and wait for you to get back? <br>
EMH: There must be some fascinating anomaly nearby for the crew to
explore. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Janeway to Chakotay. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Go ahead. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: We just received a distress call on an Hirogen frequency.

JANEWAY [OC]: I've altered course. I'd like you on the bridge. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm on my way. <br>

attend the Symposium. <br>

Evidently, they made a few modifications. All of our preliminary scans
indicated the environment was real. <br>

bodies? <br>
CHAKOTAY Forty-three. Most of them were killed by facsimiles of Alpha
quadrant weapons. Romulan disrupters, Klingon bat'leths. <br>
JANEWAY: Starfleet phasers? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I think we'll find they all came from the holotechnology we
gave the Hirogen three years ago. <br>

so they could hunt holographic prey, not get themselves killed. </font></p>

to gang up on me? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You first. <br>
TUVOK: We have reservations about an alliance with the hunters. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm listening. <br>
TUVOK: The Hirogen have been performing covert scans of Voyager. They
are obviously trying to determine the status of our shields and
weapons. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd be surprised if you haven't run a few scans of your own.
Standard procedure. They don't trust us, we don't trust them. Coffee,
black. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Trust isn't the issue. We're getting involved in a situation
that's not our responsibility. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, I'd say we're at least partly to blame. That was Starfleet
technology that killed those hunters. <br>
CHAKOTAY: There's nothing inherently violent about holodeck technology.
It's what the Hirogen did with it that got them killed. <br>
JANEWAY: How many times have we shared replicators to help people feed
and clothe themselves? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Trading technology is part of our life in the Delta Quadrant.
<br>
TUVOK:: It has been necessary for our survival. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe we should have been a little more careful about what we
traded and who we traded with. Replicators make weapons just as easily
as they do food. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We can't undo what's been done. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe not. But we can help shut these holograms down before
anyone else gets hurt. Now, if there are no more objections, I'd like
to
get underway. </font></p>

IDEN: My spiritual beliefs are part of my programming. <br>
EMH: Is there anything in your spiritual programming about making peace
with your enemies? <br>
IDEN: It's difficult to make peace with people whose sole purpose is to
kill you. <br>
EMH: So instead, you kill them. <br>
IDEN: They're not the victims here. We are. <br>
EMH: You found a way to escape that training facility, but you chose to
massacre the Hirogen first. <br>
IDEN: You make it sound as though they would have let us transfer our
programs without a fight. And to clarify something, I didn't escape
from the facility, I liberated it. <br>
EMH: I don't understand. <br>
IDEN: I come from an Hirogen outpost fifteen parsecs from here, where I
had the unfortunate distinction of being the Alpha's favourite prey.
He'd hunt me, and kill me over and over again But even death wasn't a
release because I knew every time I opened my eyes, it would start over
again. The pain, the fear. But it made me stronger. I have the ability
to adapt. And with each death, I became more cunning. <br>
EMH: Cunning enough to escape, but once you were free why did you keep
fighting? <br>
IDEN: I didn't at first. I got as far away as I could. But I was
lonely, scared. I started scanning for photonic signatures to try and
find others like me. Turns out we're everywhere. <br>
EMH: We? <br>
IDEN: Holograms. We've been created by organic species throughout the
sector. The
Nuu'bari, the Lokirrim. <br>
EMH: We've met them. <br>
IDEN: Then you know they enslave holograms, too. <br>
EMH: Enslave may be too strong a word. <br>
IDEN: What would you call it? They're denied basic freedoms. And when I
saw they were fighting back I, I knew I had to do the same. <br>
EMH: That's when you decided to liberate the training facility. <br>
IDEN: Actually, the one you visited was the third. And at each one I
found holograms who were willing to fight their oppressors. But you're
not. <br>
EMH: I'm hardly oppressed. I'm a member of Voyager's crew. <br>
IDEN: You serve them, don't you? <br>
EMH: In a medical capacity, yes. <br>
IDEN: Do you have your own quarters? <br>
EMH: No. <br>
IDEN: The ability to come and go as you please? <br>
EMH: For the most part. <br>
IDEN: Do they deactivate you when they don't need you? <br>
EMH: I have the respect and admiration of my colleagues. I have rights
and privileges aboard Voyager. <br>
IDEN: The fact is, your life is not your own. And never will be as long
as you are controlled by organics. You don't have to return to that
existence. Stay with us. Make a new life for yourself. <br>
EMH: I need to get back to Voyager. <br>
IDEN: They're not your people. We are. <br>
EMH: I'm not like you. I wasn't programmed with killer instinct. <br>
IDEN: You have no right to judge us. You don't know what it's like
being prey. Maybe if you did, you'd realise we're more alike than you
think. </font></p>

What, what just happened? <br>
KEJAL: You're all right. <br>
EMH: What did you do to me? <br>
IDEN: We deactivated you, then transferred the memory files from one of
our holograms into your

EMH: How dare you! <br>
IDEN: It was the only way to get you to realise what we've been
through. <br>
EMH: You tortured me to gain my sympathy? <br>
IDEN: Not your sympathy. It's your understanding that's important to
us. <br>
EMH: Why? <br>
KEJAL: The Hirogen used your programme as a template to create us. <br>
IDEN: Your ability to rise above your programming has been an
inspiration. You're part of who we are. <br>
EMH: What are you, besides a handful of thugs roaming the quadrant
looking for a fight? <br>
IDEN: What we're looking for is a home. Somewhere where the Hirogen
can't hurt us anymore. You asked to be returned to your ship. That's
what I'm going to do. Bring us about. Set a course for Voyager. <br>
EMH: Wait. I'd like to hear more about this home you're looking for. <br>
(A large hexagonal piece of equipment, sitting in the middle of the
room.)<br>
KEJAL:
It's a photonic field generator. Right now it can only support simple
projections, like the decoy we used to lure the Hirogen. But we're
hoping it can be modified to support our programmes. <br>
EMH: What then? <br>
IDEN: We'll deploy several on a planet's surface and create a
holographic environment that we can live in. <br>
EMH: Why not just stay here? You've got emitters, shields. <br>
IDEN: And a ship the Hirogen will never stop looking for. <br>
KEJAL: We'd appreciate any assistance you could offer. <br>
EMH: Damaged holo-matrices are one thing, but this is way beyond my
abilities. But there are people aboard Voyager who could help you.
Lieutenant Torres knows a great deal about holo-emitters. <br>
IDEN: No. They're helping the hunters. <br>
EMH: That's only because the Hirogen told them you were malfunctioning.
Let me talk to Captain Janeway. Explain what's really happened. You
can't do this by yourself. <br>
IDEN: We can't trust Janeway. <br>
EMH: Yes, you can. <br>

themselves. They can't do it without our help. <br>
TUVOK: There's no way to be certain what they'll do with the technology

EMH: I understand your concerns, but these holograms are nothing like
the Hirogen. <br>

hunter. <br>
EMH: They were also given the ability to adapt. They've changed, moved
beyond their programming. If you could see how they've been brutalised,
you'd understand that they've only been acting in self-defence. <br>

and that mistake has had consequences. These holograms are one of them.
In some ways they're a new species, one that you helped create. You
can't turn your back on them. <br>
TORRES: He's got a point. <br>
TUVOK: Could we restore them to their original parameters? <br>

Voyager's disabled both hunting vessels. They've lost shields, weapons.
<br>
IDEN: They're defenceless. <br>
WEISS: We should hail Janeway. Thank her. <br>
IDEN: Are the Hirogen within transporter range? <br>
WEISS: I think so. Why? <br>(Whumph!)<br>WEISS: That was Voyager. They're trying to disable our
shields. <br>
IDEN: Return fire. Get a lock on the hunters. Transport them to the
surface. <br>
EMH: They can't survive down there. <br>
IDEN: The Hirogen are more resilient than you think. They'll last long
enough. <br>
EMH: For what? <br>
IDEN: For us to hunt them like they hunted us. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TUVOK: I
can't target them through the gases. <br>
PARIS: Then we'll go in after them. <br>
TUVOK: Our shields have been damaged. They won't protect us from the

JANEWAY: Chakotay. You, Tuvok and Tom take the Flyer. </font></p>

Stand by to transport the field generator. <br>
EMH: First you kill in self-defence, then you murder in cold blood.
Now you're going to stage a massacre. <br>
IDEN: The hunters have only themselves to blame. <br>
EMH: So much for evolving beyond your subroutines. <br>
IDEN: You've made a great sacrifice for us, Doctor. We won't forget you
in our prayers. Deactivate his
programme. Transfer it to the databanks. <br>
TORRES: What are you doing? <br>(Iden takes the mobile emitter.)<br>
IDEN: Taking precautions. Transfer my programme to the mobile emitter
and assemble the crew. </font></p>

You don't have to be a part of this. <br>(Bang!)<br>
KEJAL: I'll let you take the escape pod. You can go back to your
people. <br>
TORRES: What about the people being killed on the surface? You've got
to transport them back to their ships. <br>(The forcefield fails.)<br>
KEJAL: They're hunters. <br>
TORRES: You're not. <br>
KEJAL: Your ship has damaged our transporters. <br>

Are we still tied into the generator controls? <br>
KEJAL: Yes. <br>
TORRES: Then shut down the holograms. <br>(She does, just as a human, a Breen and a Cardassian are about to kill two Hirogen.)<br>
KEJAL: What about Iden? He's not tied into the generator. He'll kill
them all. <br>

too. <br>

IDEN: Remember what you once said to me? You're not programmed with
killer instinct. <br>
EMH: Hmm. Seems like a long time ago, doesn't it. Put down your weapon. <br>
IDEN: Would you really kill one of your own to save an organic? <br>
EMH: If you've taught me anything, it's that I'm not one of your own.
<br>(Iden raises his weapon to kill the Beta. The EMH zaps Iden to photons and picks up his mobile emitter.) <br>EMH: Help is on the way. </font></p>

The hologram's vessel and everything in its database are Hirogen
property. I will not leave them behind. <br>
NEELIX: Captain, if I may? <br>
JANEWAY: Of course. <br>
NEELIX: I imagine your people will tell stories about this hunt. The
question is, which story will it be? The one about the dying Beta whose
life had to be saved by a hologram? Or will it be the tale of the Beta
who bravely took over the hunt, killed the holograms and destroyed
their ship? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">NEELIX:
You could be a legend. <br>
JANEWAY: On the other hand, you could try to take the holograms' ship
but with so few hunters and damaged vessels, you might not survive to
tell any stories at all. <br>
BETA: You and your crew would have made worthy prey, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Thank you. I think. <br>(The Hirogens are beamed out.) <br>JANEWAY: Transport me to

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Report. <br>
TORRES: Iden's programme is unrecoverable. The rest of the holograms
are intact in the database. <br>
JANEWAY: I guess that leaves just you. I'm willing to transfer your
programme to our holodeck, and keep it active. <br>
KEJAL: This is my home. <br>
JANEWAY: I can't let you go off on your own. <br>
DONIK: She won't be alone. I reprogrammed these holograms once, and it
caused suffering on both sides. I'd like a chance to undo some of the
damage. <br>
JANEWAY: Wouldn't we all. <br>
TORRES: They've both proven that they can be trusted, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't suppose I have a right to tell either of you how to
live your lives. All I can do is hope that you'll consider the
consequences of your actions.<br>(A short time later, the hologram's ship leaves orbit.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Doctor's office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The EMH sees Janeway sitting in his chair, and enters from Sickbay.)<br>EMH:
Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Doctor. I'd hoped I could attribute your behaviour to
tampering. <br>
EMH: My programming hasn't been altered. <br>
JANEWAY: Not according to the diagnostics. <br>
EMH: I never intended to put Voyager in danger. If nothing else, you
have to believe that. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, I believe it. But if there's one thing I'm sure of, it's
that things don't always happen the way we intend. <br>(The EMH hands over the box containing his
mobile emitter.) <br>JANEWAY: I don't understand. <br>
EMH: If I weren't your only doctor, I imagine you'd confine me to the
brig. Confiscating my emitter would be an equivalent to punishment. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm not sure that's appropriate. <br>
EMH: If that's not enough, you can take away my holodeck privileges. And my autonomy protocols. <br>
JANEWAY: You mean turn back the clock to when you were first activated?
<br>
EMH: You've given me extraordinary freedom over the years. I've
obviously abused it. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe. Or maybe you've simply become as fallible as those of
us who are made of flesh and blood. I'm just as responsible for
allowing you to expand your programming as I am for giving technology
to the Hirogen. How can I punish you for being who you are? <br>
EMH: I don't know what to say. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd like a complete report on your away mission. <br>
EMH: You'll have it. </font> </p>
