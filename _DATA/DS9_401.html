Benjamin Sisko, Stardate 46388.2. At the request of the Bajoran
provisional government, Starfleet has agreed to establish a Federation
presence in this system following the withdrawal of Cardassian
occupational forces. The first contingent of officers, including my
Chief of Operations, Miles O'Brien, arrived two days ago on the
Enterprise.

O'BRIEN: I'm told the Cardassians decided to have some fun the day they
left. Four Bajorans were killed trying to protect their shops. <br>
SISKO: Why hasn't anybody cleaned this up? <br>
O'BRIEN: We've got all available personnel assigned to repairing
primary systems, sir. The Cardassians took every component of value.
We're virtually defenceless. I discussed this with Major Kira, the
attach√© assigned here by the Bajoran government and we decided <br>
SISKO: Understood. What about the civilians who operated these shops? <br>
O'BRIEN: A lot of them lost everything they had. A few are trying to
rebuild, but most are packing up to leave. </font></p>

the floor. <br>
O'BRIEN: We can get you a real bunk off the Enterprise. I almost

KIRA: Because I have the bad habit of telling the truth even when
people don't want to hear it. <br>
SISKO: Perhaps I want to hear it. <br>
KIRA: I don't believe the Federation has any business being here. <br>
SISKO: The provisional government disagrees with you. <br>
KIRA: The provisional government and I don't agree on a lot of things
which is probably why they've sent me to this god-forsaken place. I
have been fighting for Bajoran independence since I was old enough to
pick up a phaser. We finally drive the Cardassians out and what do our
new leaders do? They call up the Federation and invite them right in. <br>
SISKO: The Federation is only here to help <br>
KIRA: Help us. Yes, I know. The Cardassians said the same thing sixty
years ago. <br>

as my first officer. It made sense. It still does, at least to me. Now,

only has a peripheral involvement in all this. We're scheduled to
depart tomorrow. If we could be permitted to take him, I promise you he
will be severely <br>
SISKO: That won't be possible. Take him to the brig. <br>

KIRA: Quark probably sent the two of them here to steal the ore samples
in the first place. <br>
SISKO: Major, there's a Ferengi legal tradition. It's called plea
bargaining. I might let the boy go, but I want something in exchange
from Mister Quark. Something very important. <br>

SISKO: Yes, sir. We met in battle. I was on the Saratoga at Wolf 359. <br>
(Oh dear, he's still carrying a grudge. Big pause.) <br>
PICARD: I assume that you have been briefed on the events leading to
the Cardassian withdrawal? <br>
SISKO: Yes, sir. I understand they've spent the last half century
robbing the planet of every valuable resource before abandoning it. <br>
PICARD: They've left the Bajorans without a means of being
self-sustaining. The relief efforts we've been coordinating are barely
adequate. I've come to know the Bajorans. I'm a strong proponents for
their entry into the Federation. <br>
SISKO: Is it going to happen? <br>
PICARD: Not easily. The ruling parties are at each others throats.
Factions that were united against the Cardassians have resumed old
conflicts. <br>
SISKO: Sounds like they're not ready. <br>
PICARD: Your job is to do everything short of violating the Prime
Directive to make sure that they are. I have been made aware by
Starfleet of your objections to this assignment. I would have thought
that after three years spent at the Utopia Planitia yards, that you
would be ready for a change. <br>
SISKO: I have a son that I'm raising alone, Captain. This is not the
ideal environment. <br>
PICARD: Unfortunately as Starfleet officers, we do not always have the
luxury to serve in an ideal environment. <br>
SISKO: I realise that, sir, and I'm investigating the possibility of
returning to Earth for civilian service. <br>

for you. <br>

depend on the shops and services of this Promenade. If people like you
abandon it, this is going to become a ghost town. We need someone to
step forward and say, I'm staying, I'm rebuilding. We need a community
leader and it's going to be you, Quark. <br>

politician. <br>

rules of conduct? <br>

administrate. You run honest games, you won't have any problems from
me. <br>
QUARK: Commander, I've made a career out of knowing when to leave, and
this Bajoran provisional government is far too
provisional for my taste. And when governments fall, people like me are
lined up and shot. <br>
SISKO: There is that risk but then, you are a gambler, Quark. <br>
ODO: And a thief. <br>
SISKO: You know, Quark, that poor kid is about to spend the best years

this ball, a hundred different things can happen in a game. He might
swing and miss, he might hit it. The point is, you never know. You try
to anticipate, set a strategy for all the possibilities as best you

JASAD [on viewscreen]: What wormhole? Our sensors show no indication of
a wormhole in this sector. <br>
KIRA: That's because it just collapsed. <br>
JASAD [on viewscreen]: What? <br>
DAX: We believe it was artificially created. That may be why our
sensors never picked up any of the usual quantum fluctuation patterns. <br>

wormhole, and now conveniently has disassembled it? <br>
