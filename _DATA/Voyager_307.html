Captain's log, stardate 50425.1. Mister Neelix and I have completed our
three day trade mission with the Tak Tak, one of the more unusual
species we've encountered in the Delta Quadrant. We are en route back
to Voyager. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Shuttlecraft]</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Oh. I've always been taught to be tolerant of other cultures
and points of view, no matter how alien, but I have to say that the Tak
Tak are the most unforgiving people I've ever met. <br>
NEELIX: They are a little impatient. <br>
JANEWAY: They make the Klingons look sedate. I may never put my hands
on my hips again. <br>
NEELIX: You had no way of knowing you were making one of the worst
insults possible. <br>
JANEWAY: Obviously they've never heard of forgive and forget. It's a
good thing you were there, Mister Neelix. I might have been shot at
dawn. I have studied chromolinguistics, American Sign Language, the
gestural idioms of the Leyron, but I just couldn't get the hang of the
Tak Tak. <br>
NEELIX: It seemed like more than just a language to me, Captain. A lot
of their gestures, from what I could tell, were ritualistic. You might
even say superstitious. <br>
JANEWAY: You have a genuine flair for diplomacy, Mister Neelix. I may
have to promote you from morale officer to Ambassador. With all the
species we're bound to meet, I could use a man like you at the front
door. <br>
NEELIX: Ambassador Neelix. I like the sound of that. We're approaching
the rendezvous coordinates. <br>
JANEWAY: Dropping to one quarter impulse. Voyager's not there, and
they're not responding to hails. I'm running a long range scan. There
they are. They're holding position in sector thirty eight, coordinates
one two one mark six. <br>
NEELIX: That's over a light year away from here. <br>
JANEWAY: The ship appears to be adrift. They could be in trouble.
Engaging maximum warp. <br>
(They reach Voyager.) <br>
JANEWAY: Janeway to Voyager. Commander Chakotay, respond. <br>
NEELIX: The ship looks perfectly fine. There's no sign of any external
damage. Any sign of the crew? <br>
JANEWAY: There's some kind of bioelectrical interference. I can't get
clear life sign readings. The escape pods are all in place, and there's
no indication of any recent transporter activity. Grab a phaser,
Ambassador. We're going to get some answers. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Still no sign of the crew, but these sensor readings are
highly erratic. A bioelectric field is permeating the ship. <br>
NEELIX: Where's it coming from? <br>
JANEWAY: I can't localise it. Let's try accessing the ships internal
sensors, see if we can get a better reading. <br>
(She accesses a wall panel.) <br>
JANEWAY: Same problem. The main computer is offline, so is the comm.
system. This is strange. One of the bio-neural gel packs in the mess
hall ruptured, but most of the systems in there seem to be functioning
normally. Let's get to the bridge. <br>
(Further along the corridor they come across a tool box and PADD.) <br>
JANEWAY: Someone was doing maintenance work on this power relay. All
the equipment is still active, but the work hasn't been completed. <br>
NEELIX: It's almost as if they dropped what they were doing and ran. <br>
JANEWAY: Come on. <br>
NEELIX: This isn't the welcome home I was expecting. <br>
JANEWAY: Me neither, but if there was an attack of some kind, why
didn't Chakotay try to contact us or send out a warning buoy? I'm
picking up a comm. signal about ten metres ahead. It's coming from
inside this room.<br>
NEELIX: This is Ensign Wildman's quarters. Is she in there? <br>
JANEWAY: I can't tell. Let's take a look. Stand ready. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Wildman's
quarters]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Here's our comm. signal, your Good Morning Voyager programme. <br>
NEELIX: Ensign Wildman is one of my most dedicated viewers. According
to the time index she activated this programme approximately eleven
hours ago. <br>
JANEWAY: Why is it still running? <br>
NEELIX: The programme is set for automatic playback until it's turned
off. (he turns it off.) The baby's missing too. <br>
JANEWAY: According to the protein decay, I'd say Ensign Wildman
replicated this eleven hours go. When we get to the bridge we'll check
the communications logs. They might tell us whether or not <br>
(They hear a buzzing insect sound.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> NEELIX:
There! <br>
(A shadow vanishes down a side corridor.) <br>
JANEWAY: I can't tell if it's humanoid, but it's emanating a
bioelectric field. <br>
NEELIX: Whatever it is, it just ran into a dead end. <br>
(Crash, rattle.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Transporter
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Over here. <br>
(There is a hole in one of the transporter pads.) <br>
JANEWAY: Something just punched right through this floor panel into the
Jefferies tubes. <br>
NEELIX: What is it? <br>
JANEWAY: Some sort of mucilaginous compound. High concentrations of
amino acids and proteins, and fragments of non-humanoid DNA. Well,
Ambassador, I'd say we've got an unexpected guest. <br>
NEELIX: Somehow I don't think he's the diplomatic type. <br>
JANEWAY: Main power is failing, and the environmental controls are
going offline. Systems are starting to shut down one by one. We'd
better get to the bridge. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Turbolift]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Good, we're still got auxiliary power. Deck one. <br>
NEELIX: It's getting awfully hot in here. <br>
JANEWAY: When environmental controls fail, heat from the warp plasma
conduits can't be vented. Expect a heat wave before long. <br>
NEELIX: No problem, I'm used to it. I grew up near the Rinax
marshlands. Our summers were the hottest in the sector. Fifty degrees
Celsius, ninety percent humidity, and the most vicious lavaflies you've
ever seen. <br>
JANEWAY: Summers in Indiana were pretty similar when I was growing up. <br>
NEELIX: Except that we had three suns and the lavaflies grew to be six
centimetres long. <br>
JANEWAY: Six centimetres? <br>
NEELIX: Insect repellant was a booming business. <br>
(Something thumps the turbocar and it stops. There is lots of buzzing
outside.) <br>
JANEWAY: There's a life form in the turboshaft. I'm engaging the manual
override. <br>
NEELIX: Ah, Captain, it sounds like our guest has bought a few friends.
<br>
JANEWAY: One more second. I can't get the pneumatic conduits to <br>
(Something punches through the door and squirts gung onto Neelix.
Janeway phasers the long tentacle that follows it.) <br>
NEELIX: That was no lavafly. <br>
JANEWAY: There's no lifeform in the tube above us. We're getting out of
here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Jefferies
tube]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Are you all right? <br>
NEELIX: Yes. Disgusting, but I'm all right. <br>
JANEWAY: It's the same mucilaginous compound we saw in the transporter
room. Come on. <br>
(They crawl along a short tube to a junction. Janeway uses her
tricorder again.) <br>
NEELIX: What is it? <br>
JANEWAY: Human lifesigns, very faint. Thirty or more. <br>
NEELIX: Where are they coming from? <br>
JANEWAY: Several decks above us. I can't pinpoint the location. <br>
NEELIX: Maybe the crew is hiding from the aliens and they set up a
defence perimeter. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe. One thing's for sure, whoever's up there is still
alive. Once we get the main computer online, we'll be able to get a fix
on their location. <br>
(They crawl to another junction.) <br>
NEELIX: It's so hot. My head is spinning. <br>
JANEWAY: You've got a high fever, fluid in your lungs. <br>
NEELIX: Lung. <br>
JANEWAY: That alien compound is acting quickly. Try to hang on. Just
three more decks. <br>
NEELIX: Aye, aye, Captain. <br>
(Neelix has a dizzy spell.) <br>
NEELIX: Captain, go on without me. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm not going to leave you here, Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: I can't. I'm so dizzy. <br>
JANEWAY: There should be an emergency medical kit up that tube. I'll
bring back something to get you on your feet. Don't go away. <br>
(She goes up the ladder and find the medical kit. Meanwhile, Neelix is
joined by a buzzing noise.) <br>
NEELIX [OC]: Help! Captain! <br>
JANEWAY: I'm coming, Neelix! <br>
(She heads back down with a hypo in her hand. Neelix screams.) <br>
JANEWAY: Neelix! <br>
(Neelix has gone. A trail of mucus leads back down the Jefferies tube. <br>
(Janeway goes to Engineering, but it is deserted. She can hear a noise
somewhere and climbs the ladder to the upper level around the warp
core. A large case is there, and it contains weaponry. She strips down
to her vest, keeping her comm. badge, and fills a backpack with small
metal items. Finally she takes a hand phaser, a knife, and a phaser
rifle. Rambo or Ripley Janeway locks and loads, ready for bear.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
(Janeway has to force the turbolift doors to open properly. There is no
one on the bridge, but there is mucus on the walls. As she works at a
wall panel in an auxiliary Science station alcove, something buzzing
rises up from behind the helm. The monitor says Distress Signal
Protocol ready to encode.) <br>
JANEWAY: This is Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Federation Starship
Voyager to anyone within range. My ship has been seized by unknown
lifeforms. Require any and all assistance. <br>
(Transmitting on all subspace channels. Something bites her on the left
arm. She squashes it. The monitor says it is scanning for lifeforms on
all decks. Janeway runs a medical device over the bite, then the
computer reports Lifesigns Located. Some are near the stern of the
vessel, and some below the bridge.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Mess
hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (The
mess hall is full of unconscious people, mostly at tables. They have
mucus on their skin, along with nasty boils.)&nbsp;<br>
JANEWAY: Harry. Harry. <br>
(Kim wheezes for breath.) <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, Chakotay. <br>
(Tiny insects fly out of the boil on his neck, then a massive three
tentacled thing flies at Janeway, throwing her over a table. It
prepares to dive at her with its central injector ready, and she blasts
it into pieces. Clutching her side, she runs out into the corridor and
into a turbolift.) </font></p>

(Janeway tries to use a magnetic clamp to open the doors, and a hand
puts a phaser at her throat.) <br>
EMH: Captain! Needless to say, I thought you were something else. It
won't be long before the other aliens sense you here and start to try
to invade sickbay. We don't have much time to treat you. <br>
JANEWAY: Doctor, what's going on? What are those ow! <br>
EMH: You've ruptured your dorsal extensor muscle and bruised two ribs.
I'm going to have to perform minor surgery. Lie on your side and try to
remain perfectly still. <br>
JANEWAY: Tell me what's happened. <br>
EMH: Voyager has been infected by a macrovirus. <br>
JANEWAY: A macrovirus? <br>
EMH: A form of life I've never encountered, or even imagined. <br>
JANEWAY: What about the crew? <br>
EMH: Captain, I promise I will tell you exactly what happened if you
just lie still. Shortly after you'd left for the Tak Tak homeworld, we
received a distress call from a nearby mining colony. A race called the
Garans. </font></p>

[OC]: They were experiencing what appeared to be a minor viral
outbreak, <br>
GARAN MINER [on monitor]: Fever, disorientation. I think it's some kind
of virus. Nothing serious, but if we don't stop it now, we'll be forced
to shut down the operation. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We may be able to help you. Doctor? <br>
EMH: A synthetic antigen may do the trick. However, it will have to be
modified for this specific virus. I'd like to beam down to the mining
colony and examine a few of the infected. <br>
CHAKOTAY: An away mission. <br>
EMH: I'm the only member of this crew who can successfully enter a
contaminated environment without risk. Besides, I've been looking
forward to spreading my wings. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Good enough. It'll take us about three hours to reach you. <br>

better get down there. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Doctor, don't forget, you're not invulnerable. If anything
happens to that portable emitter, your programme could be lost. <br>
EMH: Don't worry Commander, I've been studying the Starfleet guidelines
for away team members. For this particular scenario, medical emergency
on alien terrain, it is recommended that we keep an open comm. channel
at all times. <br>

much information. Let us know when you've found the miners. </font></p>

narrative - Garan Mine]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
Oh, very well. Stand by then. Voyager, I've found one of the miners. He
appears to be suffering from the advanced stages of severe viral
infection. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Can you treat him? <br>
EMH: Not without a more specialised immunising agent. This is curious.
The virus has begun to concentrate in a region near his neck, and it's
using his glandular tissue to create some sort of orifice. Something is
emerging. A lifeform! Commander, I think I've just discovered a
completely new form of life. From what I can tell, it appears to be a
macroscopic version of the virus. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You mean the virus has grown? <br>
EMH: Yes, by a factor of billions. The virus absorbed the miner's
growth hormones into it's protein structure, and used them to increase
it's own mass and dimensions. In essence, the virus has found a way to
leave the microscopic world and enter the macroscopic world. Our world.
It's a remarkable evolutionary development. The virus appears to be
attracted to infra-red radiation. It's mistaking my holomatrix for body
heat. At the moment, this one's approximately point five millimetres in
diameter, but it's continuing to grow at a rate of thirty microns every
second! Commander, permission to beam the virus aboard for further
analysis. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: No. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[EMH
narrative - Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
CHAKOTAY: The virus isn't in our database. The biofilters might not
recognise it. You'll have to settle for tricorder data. </font></p>

antidote. <br>

CHAKOTAY: Any luck? <br>
EMH: I'm creating a synthetic antigen that will inhibit the viruses
ability to replicate, but I haven't quite figured out how to restore
the infected cells to their original condition. As for the larger
versions of the viruses, what I've the macrovirus, I would suggest a
fly swatter. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How long before the antigen's ready? <br>
EMH: I'd say another twelve hours. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That gives us time to rendezvous with the Captain. We'll deal
with this after she's aboard. <br>
EMH: Commander. I'd like to apologise for my over-zealous behaviour on
the away mission. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Compassion is nothing to be sorry about, Doctor. It won't be
the last time you're faced with a moral dilemma in the field. But if it
makes you feel any better, your performance was exemplary. <br>
EMH: Thank you. <br>
(Chakotay leaves.) <br>
KES: I told you he'd understand. <br>
EMH: Yes, you did. <br>
EMH [OC]: We continued working on the antigen. Unfortunately the
macrovirus was working faster. It had already moved from the
transporter buffer into an adjacent system. </font></p>

roast and all the food replicators went offline. <br>

surrounding tissue will be sensitive for a few days. <br>
JANEWAY: It's getting warmer in here, isn't it. <br>
EMH: I'm afraid it's not just the ship, Captain, it's also you. You've
been infected with the macrovirus. You're experiencing a high fever. <br>
JANEWAY: Yes, on the bridge, I was bitten by one of them. <br>
EMH: Your glandular system is already being affected. If I don't treat
you now you'll end up like the rest of the crew. I've spent the past
few hours perfecting the antigen, but I haven't tested it on a live
subject yet. <br>
JANEWAY: Looks like I'll have to be your guinea-pig, Doctor. The crew,
why are they all in the mess hall and the cargo bays? <br>

the virus without killing its host cells. <br>
KES: The virus has grown by one hundred and fifty microns. <br>
EMH: It's rate of growth shouldn't hinder our analysis, as long as it's
genetic structure stays the same. <br>
(The virus is no longer visible in the microscope.) <br>
KES: Doctor! <br>
EMH: Computer, erect a level three forcefield around the microscope
station. <br>
(The forcefield flickers as the virus bounces off it.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PARIS:
Well, so much for lunch. <br>
TORRES: I may never look at food again. <br>
PARIS: I thought Klingons didn't get nauseated. You have a redundant
stomach. <br>
TORRES: Well, right now, they're both unhappy. Oh. <br>
(Torres passes out.) <br>
PARIS: Paris to sickbay. <br>
EMH [OC]: Go ahead, Lieutenant. <br>
PARIS: I just saw two macroviruses come out of B'Elanna's neck. <br>
EMH [OC]: Stand by, Mister Paris. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[EMH

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
We're close to formulating an antigen. <br>
(The virus is now very visible.) <br>
KES: The virus has grown to point three metres. <br>
EMH: On the microscopic level, the virus uses that needle-like
projection to penetrate a cell membrane. On our level, it probably
impales it's victim in much the same way, infusing him with it's own
genetic code. The antigen is ready. Kes? Computer, deactivate force
field. <br>
(Kes stands back. The virus heads for the EMH. He grabs it and injects
it. It falls to the deck and deflates.) <br>
EMH: Well. One down, ten billion to go. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH
[OC]: Eager to inoculate those already infected, I quickly headed for
the quarantined area. Though their condition had grown worse, it was
the least of our problems. <br>
EMH: (to Torres) Lieutenant, if you can hear me, I'm going to give you
an injection. It should eliminate the virus. <br>
(Paris can hear the buzzing.) <br>
PARIS: What, what is that? <br>
EMH: You don't want to know. <br>
(Two macroviruses pin the EMH onto the deck and nearly stab his mobile
emitter. He manages to roll away under the tables.) <br>
EMH: Doctor to the Bridge. Intruder alert on deck two section thirteen.
<br>
EMH [OC]: Within minutes, dozens of the larger organisms forced their
way beyond deck two and overwhelmed the ship. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH: It
wasn't long before the crew was incapacitated. Although I've developed
an effective vaccine, I can't administer it. Every time I try to get to
the crew, I'm attacked. Perhaps with your help? <br>
JANEWAY: How many of the larger macroviruses are there? <br>
EMH: I have no way of knowing. Dozens, perhaps hundreds. They're
replicating at an exponential rate. By this time tomorrow there could
be thousands. <br>
(Buzzing and thumping at the door.) <br>
JANEWAY: Speak of the devil. <br>
EMH: You're cured. <br>
JANEWAY: The question is, how do we cure the rest of the crew? This
antigen. Can it be distributed in a gaseous form? <br>
EMH: For absorption by the respiratory system? I've already considered
dispensing it through Environmental controls, but they're offline and I
have limited engineering expertise. <br>
JANEWAY: Leave that to me. All we have to do is get to Environmental
Control on deck twelve. <br>
EMH: Easier said than done. We'll run into the same problem I face when
I try to get to the Mess hall. <br>
JANEWAY: Not if I can help it. Prepare two canisters of antigen. We'll
split up and take two different routes to Environmental Control. It'll
double our chances. If you get there first, call me and I'll talk you
through the repairs. <br>
EMH: The macroviruses are attracted to infra-red radiation. Set your
tricorder to emit a thermal scattering signal. It will make it more
difficult to target you. Ready when you are. <br>
JANEWAY: We'll be right with you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Jefferies
tube]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Take Jefferies tube eleven. What's wrong? <br>
EMH: I've been studying the ship's infrastructure, and I'm familiar
with most of it, but, how do I get there from here? <br>
JANEWAY: Jefferies tube eleven. Take a left at Section 31 and straight
down past the tractor beam emitter until you hit deck ten. Get out at
section three and follow the corridor all the way around until <br>
EMH: Until I hit the shuttlebay. Then I crawl through access port nine,
go past three airlocks and then two decks down. Environmental Control's
at the end of the hall. Now I remember. Who designed this ship anyway? <br>
JANEWAY: Good luck. </font></p>

JANEWAY: But I think someone's firing at Voyager. Doctor, use the
shuttle's sensors to find out what's happening and patch the data to
me. <br>
EMH [OC]: Aye, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: It's the Tak Tak. Doctor, open a channel and hail their
Captain. <br>
EMH [OC]: Stand by. <br>
JANEWAY: Consul, this is Captain Janeway. Why are you firing at us? <br>
CONSUL [on monitor]: The Garan Mining Colony infected. We purified
them. Your distress call received. Voyager infected. We are purifying
you. <br>
JANEWAY: Purifying? You're trying to destroy us. <br>
CONSUL [on monitor]: No choice. No cure for the virus. Voyager's
existence a threat. Your illness, our apologies. <br>
JANEWAY: Wait. We've developed a cure but your torpedoes just stopped
us getting it to our crew and putting an end to this. <br>
CONSUL [on monitor]: A cure? <br>
JANEWAY: Yes. A synthetic antigen. We've tested it and it works. I can
prove it to you, and I'd be willing to share the antigen with your
people, but first you've got to stop attacking my ship. Give me a
chance to save my crew. <br>
CONSUL [on monitor]: A chance. One hour. <br>

JANEWAY: The only systems we still have access to are the ones with

Doctor, you said the macroviruses are attracted to infra-red
signatures. <br>
EMH [OC]: That's right. <br>
JANEWAY: Right now you and I are the only targets left on board. What
if we gave them something new to sink their teeth into? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
What are you suggesting? <br>

into the holodeck.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Environmental

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Doctor, it seems to be working. I've programmed the
holo-characters to react to the viruses. We don't have much time. Grab
your hypospray and get to the crew. You've got a clear path to the Mess
hall and both cargo bays. <br>
EMH [OC]: Acknowledged. What about you, Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: I've put together what you might call an antigen bomb. Now all
I have to do is drop it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
(Janeway walks along a corridor to the open Holodeck doors. She sets
the bomb timer for forty seconds but as she steps into the doorway to
throw it, a macrovirus knocks her down and she drops both the bomb and
her rifle. It lunges at her, and there is a struggle, until she rolls
away and it bends its injector on the deck. She uses her knife to cut
off one of its tentacles, then stabs it. With less than seven seconds
left. she throws the bombs into the holodeck and runs away. There is an
explosion of green gas.) </font></p>

JANEWAY: How's the crew holding up? <br>
CHAKOTAY: They're fine, although the Doctor tells me a few people are
still reporting post-viral queasiness. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm not surprised. Inform the crew that I'm granting extended
R&amp;R for all personnel, and work out the shift rotations. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Aye Captain. Speaking of R&amp;R, a few of us are going
skiing on the holodeck. The Ktarian glaciers. Fresh air, good work out.
Care to join us? <br>
JANEWAY: No, thank you, but have fun. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Not your cup of tea? <br>

enough of a workout for the time being. <br>
