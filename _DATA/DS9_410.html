SISKO: I haven't worn this in almost three years. I must've lost a
little weight. Feels kind of baggy. <br>
JAKE: It looks great. Besides, baggy's quite fashionable on Bajor right
now. Lemonade. <br>
SISKO: Since when are you interested in Bajoran fashions? <br>
JAKE: Well, a lot of Bajoran girls come to the station with their
families. <br>
SISKO: Since when are you interested in Bajoran girls? <br>
JAKE: Dad. <br>
SISKO: Wasn't it just a few weeks ago that you were playing with model
starships? <br>
JAKE: Try a few years ago. <br>
SISKO: You and I have got to have a talk, young man, about women. <br>
JAKE: That's okay. <br>
SISKO: I mean it. There are some things you have got to know. <br>
JAKE: I already know them, Dad. <br>
SISKO: Oh yeah? And who told you? <br>
JAKE: Nog. <br>
SISKO: Nog. So all you know about women you've heard from the Ferengi
boy. <br>
JAKE: We were just talking. <br>
SISKO: Swell. Listen, I don't have time now, but obviously I have a lot
of damage control to do with you on this subject. Let's set aside some
time tomorrow. <br>
JAKE: Fine. <br>
SISKO: Okay. Tomorrow morning, first thing. <br>
JAKE: Fine. What's going on anyway? <br>
SISKO: A Vulcan ship has made contact with a new species called Wadi in
the Gamma Quadrant three weeks ago. We're expecting a delegation from
their planet. <br>
JAKE: Rolling out the red carpet, huh? <br>
SISKO: First contact is our most important mission, Jake. It has to be
handled delicately. You might say it's sort of like a first date with a
girl. You want to show a certain respect for <br>

BASHIR: I can't seem to find it, sir. I mean, I'm certain I packed it. <br>

Quadrant, and I want things to go right from this moment on. Clear? <br>

SISKO: Welcome in the name of Bajor and the United Federation of
Planets. I am Commander Benjamin Sisko, and on behalf of my senior
staff officers, Major Kira, Lieutenant Dax and Doctor Bashir <br>
FALOW: Yes, yes, yes. Now, where are the games? <br>
SISKO: Games? <br>
FALOW: We were told you had games. (an aide whispers) Quark's. Take us
to Quark's. <br>

SISKO: Damn it, Quark, this is a new lifeform from the Gamma Quadrant.
I expect you to treat them with <br>
QUARK: Commander, I'm a host. A host is an ambassador of good will. The
more good will that I can generate, the longer they'll stay, the
greater my profits. I think we're talking the same language here. <br>
SISKO: Not quite. <br>
QUARK: Allow me to put your concerns to rest. (goes over to the Wadi)
So, do you fellows do a lot of gambling where you come from? <br>
FALOW: We like games. <br>
QUARK: Doesn't everybody? Doesn't everybody? You know, those virgin
territories in the Gamma Quadrant are ripe for dabo franchising. You
and I might want to talk about an investment opportunity at some point.
<br>
(Quark trails off under Sisko's glare) <br>
QUARK: So, have you figured out the essentials of the game yet? <br>
FALOW: I believe we have. <br>
QUARK: Give her a spin, One time, on the house. <br>
(The wheel comes to a stop) <br>
QUARK: Ah, two pinch showing. Too bad. Nothing ventured, nothing
gained, I always say. What would you care to wager? <br>
(One of Falow's aides brings a box.) <br>
QUARK: Oh, what a handsome container. There's an old Ferengi
expression. Good things come in small packages. (Falow opens the box)
Sticks? <br>
FALOW: Klon peags. Highly sought in our culture. They have many
different uses. <br>
QUARK: I'm sorry, but I have enough sticks right now. <br>
(Another aide brings Quark a bottle and glass) <br>
QUARK: What's this? <br>
FALOW: Alpha-currant nectar. It's priceless. <br>
(She pours Quark a drink, but his face says he wants to spit it out
again) <br>
QUARK: One man's priceless is another man's worthless. <br>
SISKO: Quark. Take the juice. <br>
QUARK: Sorry, not interested. <br>
FALOW: Then, we really have nothing to wager, except this. <br>
(And pours out a pouch of gem stones. Quark summons a waiter.) <br>
QUARK: Get these folks some drinks <br>
(Later, the Wadi are still at the dabo wheel and most customers have
gone home.) <br>
SISKO: McCoullough. <br>
QUARK: McCoullough? <br>
SISKO: Captain McCoullough. That's the name I've been trying to
remember for the last six hours. <br>
GIRL: Dabo! <br>
QUARK: Good Lord, they've won again. <br>
SISKO: McCoullough's the one who wrote the revised First Contact
procedures for Starfleet. <br>
QUARK: That right? <br>
SISKO: I wish he was here now instead of me. <br>
GIRL: Dabo! <br>
QUARK: No, they couldn't have doubled again. <br>
SISKO: With all due respect to the procedures and to McCoullough, I
have had it. This is as far as duty takes me. Keep them happy. If they
ever get tired of playing dabo, let me know. Good night. <br>
QUARK: What's good about it? (goes to the dabo wheel) Getting ready to
call it a night? <br>
FALOW: We've only just started. <br>

JAKE: Come on. We were just working on a school project. <br>

QUARK: Look, er, why don't we just call it even and no hard feelings.
Or take another spin on the house. Or two or three. A free visit to a
holosuite. Do you know what a holosuite is? Do you have sex on your
world? Look, take it all back, all the gemstones, and I'll throw in a
case of Andolian brandy to make your trip home a little more enjoyable.
<br>
FALOW: You like our gemstones? You will have the opportunity to win
more. A lot more. <br>
QUARK: I will? <br>
FALOW: In a new game. An honest game. <br>
(The dabo wheel is replaced by the Wadi game - an upside down pyramid
of 'levels' which Falow places game pieces on.) <br>
QUARK: Very unusual. I don't think I know this game. What's it called? <br>
FALOW: Chula. <br>
QUARK: What are the rules? <br>
FALOW: These are your players. We'll start them on the second shap. <br>

SISKO: I don't know yet. I just had a strange run-in with Falow. He
said something about moving along home. <br>

laboratory rodent who must work his way out of a maze. <br>
KIRA: Behavioural test? Now wait a minute. <br>
DAX: There doesn't seem to be any immediate threat, Major. <br>
KIRA: Oh, no. I'm sure all you Starfleet explorers find this
fascinating, but I'm a Bajoran administrator. This is not what I signed
up for. <br>
SISKO: I don't find this fascinating either, Major, but I suggest we
take Falow's advice and find our way home. <br>
DAX: Do the comm. badges still work? As long as we can maintain
contact, it should be reasonably safe to split up and see if any of us
can find a way out of here. <br>

ODO: No. This game is finished right now. <br>
FALOW: Stop the game. Lose your players. <br>
QUARK: Odo, just stay out of this. <br>
ODO: Quark. <br>
QUARK: I'm doing fine. They're doing fine. <br>
FALOW: Choose their path. Double their peril, double your winnings. <br>
ODO: Quark! <br>
QUARK: Fine. Fine. The safer path. <br>
FALOW: Roll. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: Isn't it a matter of simply figuring out
how to win this game? <br>
KIRA: Simply? <br>
DAX: I don't think we have any other choice. <br>
BASHIR: Seriously, we've gone from the second shap to the third shap to
the fourth shap already. <br>
KIRA: What is a shap? <br>
BASHIR: I have no idea, but we're making progress, whatever it are. <br>
KIRA: We're playing for our lives here, Doctor. I don't think you're
taking this very seriously. <br>
BASHIR: On the contrary, Major. I find the stakes to be highly
motivating. <br>
SISKO: Listen. <br>
DAX: I'm reading high magnetic field variations. Intense flux patterns.
It's coming toward us. <br>
SISKO: Find cover if you can. <br>
(Noisy swirly lights arrive. Sisko, Dax and Kira press themselves
against the side walls but Bashir is left in front of the closed door.)
<br>
(In Quark's, Falow takes a piece off the board, and Bashir vanishes
along with the light.) <br>
SISKO: Falow!

ODO: What happened to that one? Why is it there? <br>
FALOW: Next move. Choose their path. <br>
ODO: Listen to me. I want that player back. <br>
FALOW: If you would care to play the game after he's done, it can be
arranged. Choose their path. Double their peril, double your winnings. <br>
QUARK: Give me the shortcut. <br>
ODO: The shortcut? <br>
QUARK: It's the right thing to do. <br>
ODO: Are you crazy? <br>
FALOW: Double the stakes. <br>
ODO: Wait! <br>
QUARK: I know what I'm doing. I've spent my life figuring the odds of
all sorts of games. Now, I'm just learning this one, that's true, but I
know this is the right move. <br>
ODO: The right move to make you rich. <br>
QUARK: More than that. Look at the board. The shortcut skips a whole
level. I've learned there are risks in every roll of the dice. This
way, they can advance all the way home on just one move. Trust a
gambler. <br>
FALOW: Roll. <br>
(Quark holds out the dice to Odo) <br>
ODO: What? <br>
QUARK: Blow on them. <br>
ODO: Would you please just <br>
QUARK: Blow on them. <br>
(Odo blows, Quark rolls) <br>
FALOW: Thialo. <br>
(Two gold, one blue) <br>
QUARK: What does it mean? <br>
FALOW: Sacrifice one so that two may live. <br>
ODO: You can't ask him to do that. <br>
FALOW: If you do not sacrifice one, all three will be lost. <br>
QUARK: I can't. Please.<br>
FALOW: Which player? <br>
QUARK: I don't even know which one is which. <br>
FALOW: Select one to be sacrificed or else this game is finished. <br>
QUARK: Fine! Fine! Fine. Fine. I can't do it. I beg of you. A terrible
mistake has been made. This is all a misunderstanding. Please, I've
learned my lesson. I'll never cheat again. I'll never cheat again!
Please! Just don't make me do this. Anything but this. Please. Please.
Please. <br>
(Quark is on his knees, crying.) <br>
FALOW: Very well. <br>
QUARK: I don't have to sacrifice one of them? <br>
FALOW: No. You do not. We'll programme the game to choose one at
random. Final wagers. Last move.

when we had the chance. <br>
BASHIR [OC]: Commander Sisko. <br>
SISKO: Doctor? <br>
BASHIR [OC]: Over here. Hurry! <br>
KIRA: Where's it coming from? <br>
SISKO: Spread out. <br>

SISKO: Dax! <br>
DAX: My leg! <br>
KIRA: Don't move. <br>
SISKO: Nothing's broken. <br>
BASHIR: (a silhouette against a bright light) What's taking so long?
We're almost out of here. Can't you see it? <br>
SISKO: Doctor, we need some help, Dax is hurt. <br>
FALOW: Thialo. Move along home. Shap Six. <br>
KIRA: I'm reading a tectonic shift of two ground masses. We are
directly over the fault line. The cavern wall structure has been
significantly weakened by the stress. It's not going to hold much
longer. <br>
SISKO: See if you can put some weight on it. Come on, let's get out of
here. <br>
(They come to a ledge by a very deep but fairly narrow crevasse) <br>
DAX: I'll never make it across. <br>
SISKO: There's got to be a way around this. <br>
DAX: Benjamin, you and Kira can make that jump. <br>
KIRA: We're not leaving you here. <br>
DAX: This cavern is going to collapse and kill all of us if you don't
go now. Seven lives is more than enough for a Trill. You haven't even
finished one. <br>
SISKO: How could I live out that life knowing I left you behind, old
man. <br>
DAX: Don't let sentiment get in the way <br>
SISKO + DAX: Of command decisions. <br>
SISKO: Yeah, I've heard that one somewhere. <br>
DAX: If you were hurt, I'd leave you behind. <br>
SISKO: Then I'm glad I'm not the one who's hurt. Major. Major, you go
across. We'll find a way around. We'll be all right. <br>
(Kira helps Sisko support Dax) <br>
SISKO: Major, I gave you a direct order. <br>
KIRA: Court-martial me. <br>
SISKO: I can't. You're not in Starfleet. <br>
DAX: If I were your superior officer, I'd court-martial both of you. <br>
(They shuffle along the increasingly narrow ledge.) <br>
SISKO: Only a few metres more. <br>

the edge) <br>
SISKO: Hang on! <br>
DAX: Benjamin! <br>

QUARK: They made it! I won! I had full confidence in you, Commander.
There wasn't a moments doubt that you wouldn't prevail in this
outrageous <br>
FALOW: No, Quark. I'm afraid all your players were lost. <br>
KIRA: What? You mean we were never in any real danger? <br>
FALOW: It's only a game. <br>
(Falow puts in some commands, the game disappears into a small box and
the dabo table is back) <br>
FALOW: Time to move along home. <br>
SISKO: Not so fast. This may all have been a game to you, but we take
first contact with a new species very seriously, and I don't appreciate
<br>
ODO: Excuse me, Commander. <br>
SISKO: Yes, Odo? <br>
ODO: Before you blame them, you might want to ask Quark just how all
this started. <br>
SISKO: Quark. <br>
QUARK: I wish I could explain it. They just had a run of bad luck and
they blamed me for their losses and <br>
ODO: That's not what you said when you were grovelling on the floor. <br>
QUARK: Oh, that's right, you were here for the grovelling. <br>
ODO: You said something about cheating, didn't you? <br>
SISKO: Cheating? <br>
QUARK: I would have said anything to end the ordeal. It was too much
for me to bear. You have no idea the pressure I was under, Commander. <br>
FALOW: If you will excuse us. Perhaps, someday, a rematch. <br>
QUARK: You know, this game could work here. It really could. Excuse me.
Falow? Mister Falow? A word with you, sir. What's your hurry? I think
you'll like this. Mister Falow! </font> </p>
