<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Torres greets a crewwoman as she passes her.)<br>TORRES:
Good morning. <br>
PARIS: You're in a good mood. <br>
TORRES: It's another beautiful day in the Delta Quadrant. <br>
PARIS: What did you have for breakfast? <br>(They kiss.)<br>
TORRES: I'll see you tonight.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CREWWOMAN:
Here you are, Lieutenant. &nbsp;<br>(Torres takes the PADD.)<br>
TORRES: Thank you. Nice job, Ensign. (to another crewman) You keep the
warp field that stable you might just get us home a few years early.&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Engineering upper level]<br></b></font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2">ICHEB: The Starfleet manual allows for a variance of point three. <br>
SEVEN: That's only a guideline. You can do better. <br>
TORRES: I don't remember giving you permission to work here. <br>
ICHEB: I'm sorry, Lieutenant. <br>
SEVEN: I'm helping him study warp mechanics. <br>
TORRES: You should have notified me. It's a busy day, and I. <br>(Torres stumbles against Seven.) <br>
SEVEN: Lieutenant? <br>
TORRES: I'm fine. <br>(Seven helps her sit down. Icheb scans her.)<br>
ICHEB: I'm detecting another lifesign. <br>
SEVEN: Where? <br>
ICHEB: Inside Lieutenant Torres. It could be a parasite. <br>(Seven checks his tricorder readings.)<br>
SEVEN: Seven of Nine to the Doctor. <br>
EMH [OC]: Go ahead. <br>
SEVEN: I'll be accompanying Lieutenant Torres to Sickbay. <br>
EMH: What's wrong? <br>
SEVEN: I believe she's pregnant.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: The
foetus appears to be about seven weeks old and doing quite well. So are
you. <br>
PARIS: Why did she faint? <br>
EMH: Klingon and human metabolisms sometimes clash. <br>
TORRES: Tell me about it. <br>
EMH: It's not uncommon for such pregnancies to cause biochemical
fluctuations in the mother. <br>
PARIS: Is that serious? <br>
EMH: Not usually. You can expect some behavioural volatility, increased
nutritional needs. Creating new life is a big job. <br>
PARIS: Creating new life. <br>
TORRES: I can't believe it. <br>
EMH: I don't mean to be indelicate but, weren't you trying to get
pregnant? <br>
TORRES: Well, of course. I mean, we knew we wanted a family. <br>
PARIS: But the odds against human-Klingon conception are so high. <br>
EMH: Well, apparently you've beaten the odds. May I be the first to
congratulate you. <br>
PARIS: When is the baby due? <br>
EMH: Normally, Klingon pregnancies run thirty weeks. But with mixed
species, it could be sooner. <br>
PARIS: Is it a girl or a boy? <br>
TORRES: No. Don't tell. I want to be surprised. <br>
PARIS: We've already been surprised. <br>
TORRES: I just don't see any reason
