Commander's log, stardate 48481.2. My senior staff and I have been
asked to address the annual Starfleet symposium on the current
situation in the Gamma Quadrant. I'm looking forward to the opportunity
and to visiting my sister in Portland.

SISKO: Now there's something I never get tired of looking at. <br>
DAX: If you ask me, the seas could be a little more purple. <br>
KIRA: That's funny, I was just thinking they weren't green enough. <br>
BASHIR: I guess it's true what they say. There is no place like home.
No matter what colour the water is. <br>
DAX: We'd better get ready, Benjamin. Dinner tonight with Admiral
Drazman. <br>
O'BRIEN: Not Droner Drazman? The commander of the Proxima maintenance
yards? <br>
BASHIR: You're more than welcome to come along. The entire senior staff
was invited. <br>
O'BRIEN: Full dress uniform, fine table linens, a different fork for
every course? Thanks but no thanks. That's why I stayed an enlisted
man. They don't expect me to show up for these formal dinners. <br>
DAX: Major, Constable, would you care to join us? <br>
KIRA: No, thank you. <br>
ODO: I'd say this is strictly a Starfleet occasion. <br>
O'BRIEN: Commander, I'm receiving an incoming emergency message. It's
from DS Nine. <br>
SISKO: On screen. <br>
QUARK [on viewscreen: Commander, am I glad to see you. <br>
KIRA: This better be good, Quark. You're on an emergency channel. <br>
QUARK [on viewscreen: I just received a message from the Grand Nagus.
He wanted me to remind you of the critical role he played in
establishing contact with the Dominion. <br>
SISKO: You can assure the Nagus I will mention his assistance
prominently in my report to Starfleet. <br>
QUARK [on viewscreen: There is one more thing, Commander. It seems the
Nagus's nephew Belongo is currently being held by Starfleet authorities
on
Aldebaran Three. A slight misunderstanding, I'm sure. <br>
SISKO: A misunderstanding the Nagus no doubt wants to be cleared up. I
do owe him a favour. <br>
QUARK: He thinks so too. And to quote the one hundred and eleventh Rule
of Acquisition <br>
SISKO: Treat people in your debt like family. Exploit them. I have been
reading up. You can tell the Nagus I will do everything I can, but also
remind him of the two hundred seventeenth Rule of Acquisition. <br>
QUARK: You can't free a fish from water. I'll be sure the Nagus gets
the message. </font></p>

O'BRIEN: That's strange. <br>
KIRA: What's wrong? <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh, nothing serious. Just a power fluctuation in the annular
confinement beam. Hold on, that's impossible. <br>
KIRA: What happened? <br>
O'BRIEN: I stabilised the beam, but according to our sensors they never
materialised at their destination. They're just gone.

BERNARDO: Hey Vin, we've been working all night why don't we forget
these guys? I just want to go home and see Sonya and the kids and get
some sleep. <br>
VIN: What are you, an anarchist? There's a law against sleeping in the

some logo. <br>
SISKO: Logo? <br>
VIN: ID. Identification. UHC Card? Transit pass? <br>
BASHIR: Where are we? What happened to Starfleet Headquarters? <br>
VIN: Oh, perfect. Just what we need. Two more dims. <br>
SISKO: Those shotguns and uniforms. There's something very familiar
about this. <br>
VIN: Yeah, probably from the last time you were in a Sanctuary
District. <br>
SISKO: Sanctuary District? What year is this? <br>
BERNARDO: Same year as it was yesterday. Twenty twenty four. Let's go. <br>
VIN: How do they find us? <br>

who still has her comm. badge unlike Sisko and Bashir. After the

DAX: Oh, my head. <br>
CHRIS: What happened? Did you get jacked or something? <br>
DAX: Jacked? <br>
CHRIS: You know, robbed? Did they get your credit chips, your ID? <br>
DAX: It looks like they got everything, except my brooch. <br>
CHRIS: Do you live near here? Can you get home? <br>
DAX: I was travelling with some friends and I guess we got separated. <br>
CHRIS: Well, you shouldn't be walking around without ID. You'd better
order some replacements. You can use my Interface terminal if you wish.
My office is just round the corner. <br>
DAX: That's very kind of you. <br>
CHRIS: Chris. Chris Brynner. <br>
DAX: Jadzia. <br>
CHRIS: That's a pretty name. What is that, Dutch? <br>
DAX: Something like that. It's very kind of you to help me. <br>

damsel in distress. Let me help you.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: Check the Heisenberg compensators. I'll
run a level one diagnostic of the pattern buffers, see if there's any
kind of field imbalance. <br>
KIRA: Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: Any news from Starfleet? <br>
KIRA: Nothing good. As far as they can tell, Commander Sisko and the
others never materialised in San Francisco.
According to their sensors, our transporter signal disintegrated
immediately after we began the beam out sequence. <br>
O'BRIEN: That doesn't agree with our records. The system log shows the
transport was completed successfully. They definitely materialised
somewhere. <br>
KIRA: That's good news, anyway. But the question is, where? <br>
O'BRIEN: I wish I knew. Whatever the answer is, it's not in the log.
The only thing unusual it recorded was the variance in the annular
confinement beam. <br>
KIRA: But you corrected for that. <br>
O'BRIEN: It was a simple adjustment. The beam was just reacting to the
accumulation of chroniton particles in the ship's hull. <br>
KIRA: Chroniton particles? <br>
O'BRIEN: They're emitted by the cloaking device. They sometimes become
lodged in the ship's ablative armour matrix. <br>
KIRA: But we've used the transporter many times since the cloaking
device was installed. There's never been a problem before. <br>
O'BRIEN: And I don't know why there should be one now. Wait a minute.
It looks like there was a surge in temporal energy seconds before the
initiation of the transporter sequence. <br>
KIRA: Tell me that's a clue. <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh, it's a clue all right. I just don't know what it means
yet.

BASHIR: How do you feel? <br>
SISKO: Better. <br>
BASHIR: Me too. Probably transporter shock. Disorienting, but it wears
off quickly. I know one thing. We're definitely in San Francisco. I
caught a glimpse of the Golden Gate Bridge a few blocks back. <br>
SISKO: I saw it too. <br>
BASHIR: Do you know what happened to our comm. badges? <br>
SISKO: They were probably stolen while we were unconscious. This is not
the Earth we're used to, Doctor. That's still at least a century away.
I wonder what happened to Dax? <br>
BASHIR: She was caught in the transporter beam with us. Whatever
affected us must have affected her too. <br>
SISKO: That means she's probably somewhere nearby. The first chance we
get, we've got to find her. <br>
BASHIR: And then what? <br>
SISKO: And then we find our way home. <br>
VIN: All right, let's go. Bring them. <br>

BASHIR: What is this place? <br>
SISKO: A Sanctuary District. <br>
BASHIR: Twenty first century history is not one of my strong points.
Too depressing. <br>
SISKO: It's been a hobby of mine. They made some ugly mistakes, but
they also paved the way for a lot of the things we take now for
granted. <br>
BASHIR: I assume this is one of those mistakes. <br>
SISKO: A bad one. By the early twenty twenties there was a place like
this in every major city in the United States. <br>
BASHIR: Why are these people in here? Are they criminals? <br>
SISKO: No. People with criminal records weren't allowed in the
Sanctuary Districts. <br>
BASHIR: Then what did they do to deserve this? <br>
SISKO: Nothing. They're just people without jobs or places to live. <br>
BASHIR: So they get put in here? <br>
SISKO: Welcome to the twenty first century, Doctor. <br>

CHRIS: Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting. Were you able to order new ID? <br>
DAX: Just finished. It took me a while to convince them I was who I
said I was. They'll be expressing a transit pass and a couple of credit
chips in a few hours. I asked them to send it here. I hope you don't
mind. <br>
CHRIS: No problem. <br>
DAX: Thanks for letting me use your terminal and your account. <br>
CHRIS: Glad I could help. You know, those are very unusual. <br>
DAX: Oh, you mean my tattoos. <br>
CHRIS: It's amazing work. Where did you have them done, Japan? <br>
DAX: How did you guess? <br>
CHRIS: Well, I used to have one myself. A Maori tribal pattern used to
go all the way down my arm. Got it in high school back in the nineties
just like everybody else. Of course, I had to have it removed. Well,
you know how it is. To get the government contracts, you have to look
like all the rest of the drones. So I guess that makes me a sell-out. <br>
DAX: Not necessarily. What kind of business do you do? <br>
CHRIS: You don't know? Well, I guess I'll have to have a talk to my
public relations people. I'm Chris Brynner. Brynner Information
Systems? You know, Interface Operations, Net Access, Channel Ninety. <br>
DAX: That Chris Brynner! <br>
CHRIS: So what do you think? Does that make me a sell-out or not? <br>
DAX: Probably, but I won't hold it against you. <br>
CHRIS: These friends of yours that you told me about. Is there any way
for you to get a hold of them? <br>

but I don't want anyone beaming onto this ship until we know what's
going on. If they want to come up by shuttle, that's fine. <br>
O'BRIEN: Major, I think I know what happened to Commander Sisko and the
others. The temporal surge we detected was caused by an explosion of a
microscopic singularity passing through this solar system. Somehow, the
energy emitted by the singularity shifted the chroniton particles in
our hull into a high state of temporal polarisation. <br>
KIRA: Which means what? <br>
O'BRIEN: Which means the transporter beam was redirected as it passed
through the polarised particles. <br>
KIRA: Redirected where? <br>
O'BRIEN: Not where, when. The beam was redirected through time, not
space. They arrived in San Francisco, just like they were supposed to. <br>
KIRA: But not when they were supposed to. How much time are we talking
about? Days? Weeks? <br>
O'BRIEN: More like centuries.

(A calendar on the wall says today is Friday 8/30/24, temperature 15

BASHIR: Some of these people are mentally ill. They need proper medical
treatment. <br>

BASHIR: What? What is it? <br>
SISKO: That calendar over there. It says August thirtieth, twenty
twenty four. <br>
BASHIR: I'm not sure I understand. <br>
SISKO: You ever hear of the Bell Riots? <br>
BASHIR: Vaguely. <br>
SISKO: It was one of the most violent civil disturbances in American
history, and it happened right here. San Francisco, Sanctuary District
A, the first week of September, twenty twenty four. <br>
BASHIR: That's only a few days from now. <br>
SISKO: Which means if we don't get out of here soon, we'll be caught
right in the middle of it. <br>
BASHIR: Just how bad are these riots going to be, Commander? <br>
SISKO: Bad. The Sanctuary residents will take over the District. Some
of the guards will be taken hostage. The government will send in troops
to restore order. Hundreds of Sanctuary residents will be killed. <br>
BASHIR: Hundreds? And there's nothing we can do to prevent it.
Starfleet's temporal displacement policy may sound good in the
classroom, but to know that hundreds of people are going to die and to
not be able to do a thing to save them <br>
SISKO: I sympathise, Doctor, but if it will make you feel any better,
the Riots will be one of the watershed events of the twenty first
century. Gabriel Bell will see to that. <br>
BASHIR: Bell? <br>
SISKO: The man they named the Riots after. He is one of the Sanctuary
residents who will be guarding the hostages. The government troops will
storm this place based on rumours that the hostages have been killed.
It turns out that the hostages were never harmed, because of Gabriel
Bell. In the end, Bell sacrifices his own life to save them. He'll
become a national hero. Outrage over his death, and the death of the
other residents, will change public opinion about the Sanctuaries.
They'll be torn down and the United States will finally begin
correcting the social problems it had struggled with for over a hundred
years. <br>
BASHIR: And all of this is going to happen in the next few days. <br>
SISKO: Which means if we warn these people about what's coming, if we
try to help them in any way, we risk altering a pivotal moment in
history. And we can't let that happen. <br>

LEE: One of the services we provide is job placement. <br>
SISKO: And how long's that usually take? <br>
LEE: I wish I could give you a definite answer, but jobs are hard to
come by right now, what with the economy and all. My advice is to be
patient. In the meantime, take these. (cards) They're your ration
cards. You can use them to get food and water at any of the
distribution points in the district. Hang on to them. <br>

LEE: Anywhere you like. The buildings in the district are there for
everyone to use. <br>
SISKO: Thanks for your help. <br>
LEE: One more thing. A little advice. Stay away from District Security.
They've had their budget cut again. They're overworked and underpaid.
Just give them a lot of space. And watch out for ghosts. <br>
BASHIR: Ghosts? <br>
LEE: That's what we call people who haven't integrated well into the
Sanctuary. They can be dangerous, and they tend to prey on other
residents. <br>

Sanctuary Districts was overcrowding. It got to the point where they

out of sight. <br>

this man. There's no need for that man to live like that. With the
right medication, he could lead a full and normal life. <br>

treatments for schizophrenia, even in this day and age. They could cure
that man now, today, if they gave a damn. <br>
SISKO: It's not that they don't give a damn, Doctor. It's that they've
given up. The social problems they face seem too enormous to deal with.
<br>
BASHIR: That only makes things worse. Causing people to suffer because
you hate them is terrible, but causing people to suffer because you
have forgotten how to care? That's really hard to understand. <br>
SISKO: They'll remember. It'll take some time and it won't be easy, but
eventually people in this century will remember how to care. <br>
BASHIR: But it makes you wonder, doesn't it? Are humans really any
different than Cardassians or Romulans? If push comes to shove, if
something disastrous happens to the Federation, if we are frightened
enough, or desperate enough, how would we react? Would we stay true to
our ideals or would we just stay up here, right back where we started? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: So, in theory, we should be able to travel
into the past by focusing the transporter beam through the polarised
chroniton particles? <br>
O'BRIEN: The problem is, we don't know where in time Sisko and the
others are. I've narrowed it down to a dozen different possibilities.
But we only have enough polarised chronitons to make five or six
attempts. <br>
KIRA: We'll have to take our chances. Pick the most likely time periods
and send a team down with tricorders to find them. The hard part will
be to find a couple of volunteers crazy enough to risk getting lost in
time to do the job. <br>
O'BRIEN: I think I know a few likely candidates.

alley by the basement of a building.) <br>
SISKO: Here you go, Julian. <br>
BASHIR: If we ever get home, I promise never to complain about the
station's Cardassian beds ever again. Where is everybody? <br>
SISKO: In the food lines, waiting for breakfast. It's not much to look
at, but it's better than nothing. <br>
(Scrambled eggs and a slice of bread by the looks of it.) <br>
SISKO: I'm sorry. They ran out of utensils and napkins. <br>
BASHIR: Why am I not surprised? <br>
SISKO: When you're finished eating, I think we should get up on the
roof of one of these buildings. I want to get a better look at the
place. <br>
BASHIR: Do you think there's a way out of here? <br>
SISKO: If there is, we'll find it.

children.) <br>
GUARD: Not you two guys again. Look, I told you, we don't have any
room. <br>
SISKO: We're not here to stay. All we want is to do is get up on the
roof and take a look around. <br>
GUARD: It doesn't matter what you want. You can't come in. We've got to
protect what's ours around here. <br>
BASHIR: Look, maybe we can make a deal. Isn't there something we could
exchange in order to get access to the roof? <br>
GUARD: I don't know. What have you got to offer? That's what I thought.
Look, maybe you guys should try another building. <br>
(Sisko and Bashir start to walk away and a man whispers in the guard's
ear.) <br>
GUARD: Hey, wait a minute. Maybe we can make a deal after all.

SISKO: Well at least now we look like we belong here. <br>
BASHIR: Yeah, and we smell just as bad as everyone else too. <br>
(A boy is being tended by an older man. As he hears their footsteps he
grabs a knife.) <br>
WEBB: Stay away from him. <br>
SISKO: Whatever you say. Just put the knife down. <br>
WEBB: Step into the light so I can see you. <br>
SISKO: We're new here. We're just trying to get up to the roof, get a
better look at the place. <br>
WEBB: Believe me, it doesn't look any better from up there. <br>
DANNY: Dad. <br>
WEBB: It's going to be okay, Danny. <br>
BASHIR: What happened? <br>
WEBB: He was beaten up by some ghosts. My wife went to get help, but
there's only one doctor on duty at the Processing Centre. <br>
BASHIR: Well, why don't you let me take a look? I know a little bit
about medicine. <br>
SISKO: Julian. <br>
BASHIR: It can't hurt to just look. <br>
(Bashir sits next to the boy.) <br>
BASHIR: Hey, I'm just going to take a quick look here, okay? <br>
(He opens the shirt and checks the ribcage.) <br>
BASHIR: Does that hurt? Here? Looks like you've been lucky. No broken
ribs and these cuts are mostly superficial. You're going to be okay.
You're going to need some clean rags and something to disinfect these
wounds. Alcohol should do. <br>
WEBB: I think I can get some. <br>
BASHIR: Okay, here we go. <br>
SISKO: Looks like we made a new friend.

BASHIR: I don't really practice anymore. <br>
WEBB: But there are people here who need you. <br>
BASHIR: I'm sorry, but they'll have to get along without me. <br>
WEBB: You two are new here, so let me explain something to you. You can
forget about getting out of here any time soon. This is your home now.
The only help we're going to get is from each other, and if we don't
start pulling together, we're finished. <br>
SISKO: All we want is to be left alone. <br>
WEBB: My mistake. I thought you wanted to get out of here. <br>
BASHIR: We do. <br>
WEBB: Well the only way that's going to happen is if we get organised
and let people on the outside know what's going on in here. <br>
SISKO: Do whatever you want. Just leave us out of it. <br>
WEBB: If you want to be left alone, that's fine with me. But if you
want to help us, and help yourselves, you know where to find me.

MAN: Our sea floor mining project is almost ready to go into operation.
The Pan-Caribbean government did have some misgivings, but I think
we've won them over. I hear you just came back from Christchurch? <br>
CHRIS: Yes. Did a little skiing on Mount Cook. <br>
WOMAN: You're lucky. We had to cancel our trip to the Alps this year
because of the student protests in France. <br>
CHRIS: I thought the Neo-Trotskyists were going to put a stop to that. <br>
WOMAN: They're not having any more luck that the Gaullists did. <br>
MAN: Europe is falling apart. <br>
WOMAN: Well, at least we don't have to worry about that kind of thing
here. <br>
DAX: Don't count on it. <br>
CHRIS: You'll have to excuse Jadzia's cynicism. She was just mugged
yesterday. That kind of thing's bound to give a negative impression of
the future. <br>
WOMAN: So, who mugged you? Did you see them? <br>
DAX: It doesn't really matter. I'm just glad that I wasn't hurt. <br>
CHRIS: Well, whoever it was did a very thorough job. They took
everything she had, even her ID. <br>
DAX: Chris rescued me and let me use his computer to get my replacement
ID. <br>
MAN: You're lucky the police didn't find you first. If they'd caught
you on the street without ID, you might have ended up in a Sanctuary
District. <br>
WOMAN: I thought they stopped doing that. <br>
MAN: Why would they? It's the only way to keep those people off the
streets. <br>
DAX: Excuse us a minute. <br>
(Dax and Chris move away.) <br>
DAX: Is that true? <br>
CHRIS: Is what true? <br>
DAX: About taking people without ID to a Sanctuary District. <br>
CHRIS: Yes, it is. Why? <br>
DAX: I still haven't found my friends. <br>
CHRIS: And you think they might be in a Sanctuary District? <br>
DAX: It's possible. If you hadn't found me, I might've wound up in one.
Can we check and see if they're inside? <br>
CHRIS: Well, that might take some doing. The Sanctuary District records
are not posted on the Net. But I might be able to pull in some favours.

BASHIR: And I thought the replimat lines were bad. By the time we get
dinner, it'll be time for breakfast. You'd think that before they lock
thousands of people into a twenty square block area, they'd give some
thought to how those people are going to get fed. <br>
SISKO: I'm go see how much longer this is going to take. <br>

BASHIR: If only I'd had my medkit. If only I'd got him to a hospital I
might've been able to save him. <br>
SISKO: You did all you could, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: But it wasn't enough, was it? A good man died because of us.
And what about the hostages? What's going to happen to them? <br>
SISKO: Without Bell, there's a good chance those hostages are going to
die. <br>
BASHIR: And if that happens, how is it going to affect the future? <br>

those hostages survive.

KIRA: All right, Chief, let's get over to the transporter room before
we change our minds. <br>
O'BRIEN: Too late, Major. It looks like Starfleet's changed our minds
for us. Headquarters thinks our plan's too risky. They're afraid that
while we're searching for Sisko and the others, we may contaminate the
timeline. <br>
KIRA: Get me Admiral Wright. <br>
O'BRIEN: I had a feeling you'd say that. That's odd. <br>
KIRA: What is it? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm not getting any response from Starfleet. <br>
ODO: Is there something wrong with our communications array? I was just
talking to Starfleet Security when my comm. line went dead. <br>
O'BRIEN: There's nothing wrong on our end. Everything checks out fine. <br>
KIRA: Could be interference on the comm. channels. Try a wide band
subspace signal. <br>
O'BRIEN: Still nothing. Maybe if I direct it toward one of the
Federation communications satellites in Earth orbit. <br>
ODO: What is it, Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: They're not there. The entire Earth satellite network is gone.
<br>
KIRA: The spacedocks? The orbital habitats? <br>
O'BRIEN: All of it. The Utopia Planitia yards on Mars, the terraforming
stations on Venus, Starfleet Headquarters. I'm not detecting a single
sign of Starfleet activity anywhere in this sector. <br>
KIRA: Try a non-Federation frequency. <br>
O'BRIEN: The only subspace signals I'm detecting are coming from the
vicinity of Alpha Centauri. And they're Romulan. <br>
KIRA: That's impossible. <br>
ODO: Do you think Sisko and the others might have somehow altered the
timeline? <br>
O'BRIEN: They must have. <br>
KIRA: Then why weren't we affected? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm not sure. Maybe, maybe when it exploded, the singularity
that polarised the chroniton particles created some kind of subspace
bubble around the ship, isolated it from the changes in the timeline.
I'm not sure, I'd have to run some tests. One thing's for certain,
right now this ship is all that's left of Starfleet.

promised us jobs. I don't know about you, but I haven't been on any job
interviews lately, and neither has anyone else. They've forgotten about
us. <br>
SISKO: So what do we do? <br>
WEBB: We make them remember. The day after tomorrow, we're going to
hold a rally outside the Processing Centre. I want everyone to be
there. Gimmies, ghosts, even the dims. I want to remind the people
outside that we haven't done anything wrong, that we're not criminals,
