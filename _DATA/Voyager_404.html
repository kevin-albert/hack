crewman is dragged away by his heels, leaving a smear of blood from the
back of his head on the deck. The person doing the dragging has a very
pale face. He returns to where the dead man had been and cleans up the
blood. Then he flickers, like a hologram, and goes to the command
chamber.)<br>DEJAREN: To any vessels within range. I hope this message reaches you.

So we rigged the security console so that every time Tuvok accessed the
internal sensors it would play a little message. <br>
KIM: Live long and prosper. <br>
PARIS: No matter what button he pushed, live long and prosper. <br>
KIM: Naturally, no one was available to fix the malfunction <br>
PARIS: So Tuvok had to stretch his Vulcan patience to the limit for the
rest of the day. <br>
KIM: I swear you could hear him grinding his teeth from across the
bridge. <br>
PARIS: And just when he thought it was over, when he went back to his
quarters and ordered a cup of Vulcan tea, the replicator says <br>
KIM: Live long and prosper! <br>
JANEWAY: The first time I met Tuvok he dressed me down in front of
three Starfleet admirals for failing to observe proper tactical
procedures during my first command. My human ego took a little
bruising, but, of course, he was right. (she stands.) Over the past nine years I've
come to rely on his insightful and unfailingly logical advice. For
outstanding services, Chief Tactical and Security Officer, it's my
pleasure to grant you the rank of Lieutenant Commander.
Congratulations, Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: Thank you, Captain. Had I known this commendation entailed
ritual humiliation, I might have declined. However, I accept it with
gratitude and will honour the responsibility that comes with it. During
my three years on Voyager I have grown to respect a great many of you.
Others I have learned to tolerate. As your Tactical Officer, I will
continue to do my best to ensure a safe passage home. As a Vulcan, I
share the following sentiment. Live long and prosper. <br>

B'Elanna, this is ridiculous. It's been three days and we haven't said
a word to each other. <br>
TORRES: I know, I know. We have to talk. <br>
PARIS: About what you said. I mean, the part about being in love with
me. I realise you were suffering from oxygen deprivation and we were
literally seconds away from death, so I know you probably didn't mean
it. <br>

Really, you can just pretend that I didn't say it. In fact let's just
pretend that I didn't <br>

EMH: The Captain has authorised me to recruit someone with advanced
medical training to help out in Sickbay. Unfortunately, the most
qualified crewmember is you. <br>
PARIS: You want me to be the new nurse? <br>
EMH: If that's the title you prefer. It will only be temporary. Three

CHAKOTAY: We've like to enhance the Astrometrics lab. It hasn't been
upgraded since Voyager left spacedock. <br>
KIM: I'll start right away. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I've assigned Seven of Nine to work with you. She's agreed to
provide us with all the navigational data for this area she acquired
during her time with the Borg. Is there a problem? <br>

NEELIX: The delegate says he's looking forward to trading with such an

absolutely necessary. I'm still concerned about damaging your mobile

speak, I'd like to meet him, study him. I'll bring Lieutenant Torres
just to be safe. She knows more about my emitter than anyone. <br>

Relax, Doctor. I'm sure we'll find the ship. <br>

wisdom of leaving Mister Paris in charge of my Sickbay. <br>
TORRES: Tom will do fine. He's a very responsible guy. <br>
EMH: Well, I suppose you'd know better than I would. <br>

Hello? Is anyone here? We're here to help you. <br>(Dejaren appears behind him briefly.)<br>
TORRES: No signs of life? <br>

That was a rhetorical question, Lieutenant. <br>(Dejaren advances, hammer in hand.)<br>

DEJAREN: Sorry. Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you. <br>
EMH: You sent the distress call? <br>
DEJAREN: Yes, yes, that's me. It was me. And you, you're an isomorph
like myself? <br>
EMH: We use the term hologram. <br>
DEJAREN: Hologram. And you, you're a hologram too? <br>
TORRES: No. <br>
DEJAREN: You're organic. <br>
TORRES: Ah, that's one way of putting it, yes. <br>(Dejaren flickers.) <br>TORRES: It looks like your
programme is fairly compatible with our holographic technology. Can you
tell me where I can access your projection controls? <br>
DEJAREN: Why? <br>
TORRES: You're obviously malfunctioning. Maybe I can repair you. <br>
DEJAREN: Oh, of course. I'd appreciate that. Over there. You can access
my systems from that console. <br>
EMH: What happened here? <br>
DEJAREN: Oh, it was terrible, just terrible. You see, we left Seros
eight months ago. Seros, that's our home planet. With a crew of six. <br>
EMH: All isomorphic projections? <br>
DEJAREN: No, just me. I'm an HD25 maintenance unit with extreme hazard
clearance. I'm responsible for cleaning the reactor core, ejecting
antimatter waste, that sort of thing. When the crew got sick there was
nothing I could do. I'm not designed for medical functions. I, I<br>
EMH: Try to calm down. Explain what happened one step at a time. <br>
DEJAREN: Two of the crew members left to survey a planet. When they
came back they'd been infected by a deadly virus. It spread quickly to
the other organics on board, and one by one, well,&nbsp;I watched them all die. Then
things started to malfunction here. I've limited knowledge of the
controls. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't come. <br>
TORRES: I think I've stabilised your programme, but I'll need access to
your primary isomatrix. Where is it? <br>
DEJAREN: On the lower deck. You, you shouldn't go down there. <br>
TORRES: Why not? <br>
DEJAREN: Too dangerous. That deck's been flooded with antimatter
radiation. Organic flesh would disintegrate within seconds. You can
access my isomatrix from this deck. There's an interface junction in
that compartment. <br>
TORRES: Thanks. <br>

SEVEN: The exoskeleton on this limb can withstand it. <br>
KIM: That's all well and good, but there are safety procedures we've
got to follow. <br>
SEVEN: Your procedures are a waste of time. <br>

DEJAREN: You can use this emitter to go anywhere? <br>
EMH: Well, my Captain has imposed a few restrictions. But I'm free to
leave Sickbay, join away missions, take a stroll. <br>
DEJAREN: Extraordinary. I've never left this vessel before. And until
the crew got sick, I ever even left the antimatter storage chamber. Do
you know what it's like spend your life trapped inside a tiny room, not
knowing what's beyond the door, what the world is really like? Nobody
coming to see you or talk to you unless they want something? <br>
EMH: Actually, I know exactly what it's like. When I was first activated
I was regarded as little more than a talking tricorder. I had to ask
for the privileges I deserved. The right to be included in crew
briefings, the ability to turn my programme on and off. It's taken some
time, but I believe I've earned the respect of the crew as an equal. <br>
DEJAREN: An equal? <br>
EMH: I've also been pursuing personal interests. Art, literature,
music. Perhaps you could do the same. <br>
DEJAREN: Oh, no, no, no. My programmers on Seros would never allow
that. <br>
EMH: Then you'll convince them. Maybe they'll appreciate how well you've
coped with this situation, how you've managed to find help. Think about
it. You've already exceeded the sum of your subroutines. <br>(The EMH puts his tricorder back in the medkit. Dejaren starts wiping the console.)<br>EMH: What are you
doing? <br>
DEJAREN: Nothing. Er, nothing. I'm just sterilising the ship. I'm
fastidious about germs. I know that must sound strange coming from an
artificial being. <br>

your matrix. <br>(She turns the power off.)<br>

DEJAREN: You nibble, like a fish. <br>
TORRES: I'll take that as a compliment. <br>
DEJAREN: Oh, it is. I've never seen a fish before,&nbsp;not a real
one, but I've read about them on our database. Fish aren't like other
organics. They're more passive, I think, most of them. And so clean. Is
there anything I can do to help with repairs? <br>
TORRES: As soon as I'm done with lunch, you could help me access your
primary matrix. <br>
DEJAREN: Gladly. <br>
TORRES: Is something wrong? <br>
DEJAREN: Seeing the ship ripped apart like this, it's. I, I guess I
can't help feeling a kind of affinity for this vessel. It sustains my
existence. Sometimes I feel like it's a part of my body, my soul. That
probably sounds silly to you. <br>
TORRES: No. No, I understand how you feel. <br>
DEJAREN: You couldn't possibly understand how I feel. You're an
organic. You exist apart from your ship. I understand how you feel. <br>
TORRES: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. <br>
DEJAREN: You're the one who's trapped, not me. You spend your entire
life stuck inside a biological cage of flesh and bone and blood. <br>
TORRES: Right. I'm going to go give the Doctor an update. <br>
DEJAREN: I exist as pure energy, but you depend on food and water to
survive. Frankly, I find it disgusting. Look at you, Look at you.
Grinding up bits of plants and animals with your teeth. Secreting
saliva to force it down your oesophagus into a pit of digestive acids.
You can't even stand to think about it yourself. What a repulsive
creature you are! Constantly shedding your skin and hair, leaving your
oily sweat on everything you touch. You think that you are the height
of intellect in the universe, but you are no better than any filthy
animal and I am ashamed to be made in your image! My apologies. My
apologies. I have acquired some hostility towards organics. It was not
meant for you. I was treated quite badly by the crew here. <br>

biological life. Let's just say they're a bit unconventional. Did you
realise that we organics are a bunch of inferior, disgusting animals? <br>

TORRES: He started ranting about how much he despises organics. I
didn't think I was going to get out of there without a fight. <br>
EMH: I will admit he is somewhat socially inept. <br>
TORRES: Inept? He's a lunatic. <br>
EMH: That is hardly a sound medical diagnosis. <br>
TORRES: He has also been lying to us. I just ran a tricorder scan of
the lower deck. The one he said was flooded with radiation? Well, it's
not. <br>
EMH: Why would he lie about that? <br>
TORRES: I don't know. Maybe he doesn't want us to go down there. Maybe
he's hiding something. <br>
EMH: I understand your concerns, Lieutenant. I've been talking to him
as well, and I recognise that he has some behavioural difficulties. But
imagine what he's been through. Trapped in a room no bigger than a
storage compartment. And he's had almost no interaction with organic
beings. It's only natural he'd developed problems communicating, even a
little resentment. Do you recall my own behaviour when I was first
activated? <br>

committed to helping him, but I want the ability to shut down his
programme if I have to. <br>

primary isomatrix. You keep him occupied until I get back. I don't

EMH: A holographic fish? <br>
DEJAREN: Magnificent, isn't he? So peaceful, and so content. I
programmed him to keep me company. Don't you have a pet? <br>
EMH: Oh, it wouldn't be appropriate, not in a medical environment. <br>
DEJAREN: They wouldn't let me have one either. I had to hide him. <br>
EMH: He's very lifelike. I didn't realise you had such a talent for
holographic design. <br>

DEJAREN: That's how much power went into life support. Fifty nine point
two percent. Just to keep them breathing, warm, comfortable. <br>
EMH: They do require quite a bit of maintenance, don't they? <br>
DEJAREN: I should know. I spent my entire existence cleaning up after
them. When they were busy sleeping or reading, or engaging in their
slovenly carnal pleasures. <br>
EMH: And this is the sensor grid. You'll find it most useful when you
want to scan <br>
DEJAREN: They took advantage of me. I wish I'd been more like you. You
showed me that I could be more than a slave to these biological
creatures. <br>(Torres enters the forbidden lower deck and follows her tricorder signals.)<br>DEJAREN: I'm not taking this ship back to the organics. I won't
return to that existence. <br>
EMH: It's&nbsp;a little extreme, don't you think? <br>
DEJAREN: Join me. Leave Voyager. Escape your prison. Together we'll
take this vessel and explore the galaxy. </font></p>

DEJAREN: You said I should be more self-sufficient. <br>
EMH: I agree that we should be treated equally as members of the crew.
But we're still projections of energy and light. We have limitations. <br>
DEJAREN: No! No! No, no, no, no, no! We don't need nourishment, we
don't suffer disease. We're the higher form of life. <br>(Torres triggers an alarm.)<br>

Kim personal log, stardate 51186.2. Working with Seven of Nine is
starting to get a little awkward. Tom's right. Anything more than
friendship is a bad idea. But I can't stop thinking about her. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> SEVEN:
You wish to see me, Ensign? <br>
KIM: I had this midnight inspiration about reconfiguring astrometric
projectors. I hope you weren't regenerating. <br>
SEVEN: I was not. <br>
KIM: This is tricky stuff. It could use your touch. Your way of looking
at things. A fresh perspective. <br>
SEVEN: Your data. <br>(Kim hands her a PADD.)<br>
KIM: Why don't you sit down? <br>
SEVEN: I prefer to stand. <br>
KIM: This could take a while. You'd be more comfortable. <br>
SEVEN: Comfort is irrelevant. We're here to work. <br>
KIM: Okay. <br>
SEVEN: This light is insufficient. <br>
KIM: But it's relaxing, don't you think? After hours, quiet. Voyager
isn't all Jefferies tubes and cargo bays, you know. Tell you what, when
we're done here, I'll take you to the holodeck. We'll run the Ktarian
moonrise simulation. It's beautiful. <br>
SEVEN: Beauty is irrelevant. Unless you wish to change the nature of
our affiliation. <br>
KIM: What do you mean? <br>
SEVEN: I may be new to individuality, but I am not ignorant of human
behaviour. I've noticed your attempts to engage me in idle
conversation, and I see the way your pupils dilate when you look at my
body. <br>
KIM: I don't know what you're talking about. <br>
SEVEN: Obviously you've suggested a visit to the holodeck in the hopes
of creating a romantic mood. Are you in love with me, Ensign? <br>
KIM: Well, no. <br>
SEVEN: Then you wish to copulate? <br>
KIM: No! I mean. I, I don't know what I mean. <br>
SEVEN: All of these elaborate rituals of deception. I didn't realise
becoming human again would be such a challenge. Sexuality is
particularly complex. As Borg we had no need for seduction, no time for
single cell fertilisation. We saw a species we wanted and we
assimilated it. Nevertheless, I am willing to explore my humanity. Take
off your clothes. <br>
KIM: Er, Seven. <br>
SEVEN: Don't be alarmed. I won't hurt you. <br>
KIM: Look, this is a little sudden. I was just trying to. Part of the
team, you know? Maybe we should just quit for now. <br>
SEVEN: All right. Let me know when you wish to resume our work. </font></p>

It's all right, B'Elanna. You're safe. <br>
TORRES: The isomorph? <br>
EMH: Apparently you deactivated him. <br>
TORRES: I took all of his emitters offline. <br>
EMH: Not a moment too soon. I found six corpses on this deck, all of
them murdered. You almost became number seven. <br>
TORRES: Ah! Oh, what did he do to me? <br>
EMH: He reached inside your chest, grabbed your heart, and perforated
your fourth ventricle. <br>
TORRES: Great. <br>
EMH: I've stabilised your pericardium, but I'm concerned about the
internal bleeding. <br>
TORRES: Prognosis? <br>
EMH: Less than stellar unless I can get you back to Voyager.
Unfortunately I'm having trouble accessing our transporters. <br>
TORRES: He must have disabled our comm. link to the shuttle. Help me get to
the command chamber. </font></p>

Looks like he set up a dampening field. I think I can cut through it,
but I'll need to open this control panel. My engineering kit, it's on
that console. <br>
EMH: B'Elanna, I thought you said you took all the emitters offline. <br>
TORRES: I did. Why? <br>(Because Spectrum the fish is still swimming in his bowl.)<br>
EMH: I think you'd better double-check. <br>(The sound of Torres falling to the floor. Dejaran is standing over her with a hammer.)<br>
DEJAREN: You said you'd help me. <br>
EMH: Put that down. <br>
DEJAREN: You lied. You lied to me. I thought you were my friend. <br>
EMH: It's for your own benefit. Someone needs to repair your programme.
It's malfunctioning. You're unstable. <br>
DEJAREN: No, no, no! You're unstable. You're a hologram who thinks
like an organic. <br>(Dejaren swings the hammer at the EMH. It goes through him, of course. The EMH throws his medkit through Dejaren.)<br>
EMH: This could get tedious. <br>(Dejaren's
next swing hits his mobile emitter. The EMH deactivates and it falls to
the deck. Dejaren picks it up. Torres stirs. She has a bad cut on her
forehead.)<br>
DEJAREN: Freedom. Oh, you're getting blood everywhere. I'm going to
have to deactivate you. (He backs Torres into a corner and swings the
hammer. She dodges underneath it and goes into the interface junction
compartment. She closes the door, but Dejaran walks through it. Torres
crawls backwards and activates the isomimetic conduit lying on the
floor. She jabs it into Dejaran and it stays there until he finishes
decompiling. A little later, she reactivates the EMH whilst sitting on
the deck.) <br>
EMH: Is he? <br>
TORRES: Deactivated. <br>

CHAKOTAY: Already? You and Seven must have been putting in a lot of
extra hours on this. <br>
KIM: She's not much for procrastinating. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm sure she's not. Looks like you're ready to begin
construction. <br>
KIM: It might be better, more practical, to bring in an engineering
team for that. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Recruit all the help you need. <br>
KIM: In fact, they should probably take over at this point. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Don't you want to supervise their work? The Astrometrics lab
is your baby. <br>
KIM: I would, of course. Er, I just don't think that would be the best
use of ship's personnel. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Oh, I can rearrange the duty shifts. <br>
KIM: Oh, no, Commander, you don't have to do that. I'm sure Seven can
handle things without me. <br>

you'll excuse me, I'll be going now. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Ensign Kim. Let's have it. <br>
KIM: We had a misunderstanding. <br>
CHAKOTAY: About? <br>
KIM: It's nothing really important. Just your basic Borg - human
cultural differences. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Really? That's not what she says. <br>
KIM: You, you, you spoke, you spoke to her? <br>
CHAKOTAY: She seems to think you're making good progress. She finds you
reasonably efficient, and says you've been helping her learn more about
our complex social interactions. Any idea what she meant by that? <br>

I've stopped the internal bleeding, and repaired the tissue damage.
Your pericardium is clean as a whistle. Which is more than I can say
for my Sickbay. <br>
PARIS: I'm sorry about the mess. I haven't had time to clean up. It was
a hectic day. I treated two broken bones, an upset stomach and a
lacerated hand. <br>
TORRES: Does this mean you're too tired to meet later, in my quarters? <br>
PARIS: Are you sure your heart can take it? <br>
EMH: I'm detecting elevated hormonal levels. If you two don't take it

PARIS: If you'll excuse me, I have to go check on Harry. I hear he's
having a nervous breakdown. It's a long story. <br>
EMH: Not so fast, Mister Paris. You are going to help me sterilise
every square millimetre of this Sickbay. No doubt you've left your oily
residue on every hypospray, your sloughed secretions on every console.
Just kidding. In fact, I've had a change of heart about my
fastidiousness. A little clutter never hurt anyone. (he drops the hypospray) Sickbay should have
a more organic touch, don't you think? To help our patients feel more
at home. <br>(The EMH goes into his office.)<br>
