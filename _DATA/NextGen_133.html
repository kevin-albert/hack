Captain's log, Stardate 42494.8. The Enterprise is bound for Star
Station India to rendezvous with a Starfleet medical courier. We've
been told only that our presence is imperative. Hopefully the mission
will give me further opportunities to assess the performance of our new
Chief Medical Officer.

(Troi enters) <br>
TROI: You wanted to see me, Captain? <br>
PICARD: Yes, Counsellor. Come, sit down. Counsellor, you've had the
opportunity to observe Doctor Pulaski for some time now. How would you
evaluate her as a Chief Medical Officer? <br>
TROI: I've never met a more dedicated physician. I would say she has a
passion for her work. <br>
PICARD: Yes, of course. I entirely agree. Is it possible that such
consuming dedication could interfere with her judgement? <br>
TROI: I feel your concern, Captain, but I don't share it. Perhaps
because I've had the opportunity to spend more time with her and get to
know her better. <br>
PICARD: Yes, perhaps you're right. <br>
DATA [OC]: Captain, we are picking up a faint distress signal on an
open subspace frequency. It appears to be coming from an adjacent

TELAKA [OC]: Captain's log, stardate 42493.1. There are only six of us
left. We've set course for the nearest Federation outpost, but I am
afraid it's too late. All attempts to analyse what is happening have
failed. In the last few hours I've watched friends grow old and die,
and I'm seeing it happen to me. Captain L.I. Telaka, USS Lantree. <br>
RIKER: Captain Telaka was my age, sir. <br>
PICARD: Doctor? <br>
PULASKI: Every member of the Lantree crew had a complete examination at
the beginning of this duty cycle eight weeks ago. They were in perfect
health. <br>
TROI: Nothing else since? <br>
PULASKI: A single medical entry noting that the First Officer was
treated for Thelusian flu five days ago. <br>
PICARD: Thelusian flu? <br>
PULASKI: It's an exotic but harmless rhinal virus. It couldn't have
caused this. <br>
RIKER: The last port of call of the Lantree was the Darwin Genetic
Research Station on Gagarin Four three days ago. <br>
PULASKI: Whatever happened, it could be something that the Lantree crew
already had or it could have come from Gagarin. At the very least, the
people from Darwin Station deserve a warning. We may have to consider a
quarantine. <br>
PICARD: You'll agree that we should quarantine the Lantree. <br>
PULASKI: Absolutely. <br>
RIKER: Lieutenant, initiate the quarantine transmitters on the Lantree
and activate her marker beacons. We'll need to find her again. <br>

PICARD: Darwin Station, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS
Enterprise. <br>
(A middle aged woman comes on the viewscreen. She seems harassed) <br>
KINGSLEY [on viewscreen]: Enterprise, this is Darwin Station. I'm
Doctor Kingsley. We've just declared a medical emergency here. We need
your help. <br>
PULASKI: Doctor Kingsley, what is the nature of your emergency? <br>
KINGSLEY [on viewscreen]: To whom am I speaking, please? <br>
PULASKI: I'm Doctor Pulaski, Chief Medical Officer. <br>
KINGSLEY [on viewscreen]: Katherine Pulaski, author of Linear Models of
Viral Propagation? <br>
PULASKI: That was a long time ago. <br>
KINGSLEY [on viewscreen]: But still the standard. I can't think of
anyone I'd rather be dealing with. Doctor, we're experiencing the rapid
onset of geriatric phenomena. The first symptom is sudden, acute
arthritic inflammation. Then the aging process accelerates. <br>
PULASKI: The Lantree. <br>
KINGSLEY [on viewscreen]: Doctor Pulaski, I celebrated my thirty fifth
birthday a week ago. <br>
PULASKI: Doctor, we understand that Darwin Station is involved in
genetic research. Is there a possible connection? <br>
KINGSLEY [on viewscreen]: Our research here is limited to human
genetics. I can assure you we're not dealing with something that got
away from us. We believe that we were infected by a supply ship that
was here three days ago. <br>
PICARD: Doctor, if you're speaking of the Lantree, we encountered it a
few hours ago. All the crew members were dead. <br>
KINGSLEY: Which would seem to confirm our suspicion. Were you able to
establish a pathology, Doctor? <br>
PICARD: Doctor, did you hear what I said? All the twenty six men and
women aboard that ship were dead. <br>
KINGSLEY: I heard you, Captain, and the prognosis is alarming, but my
immediate concern is our children. <br>
PULASKI: Children? <br>
KINGSLEY: They represent years of advanced genetic research. You must
evacuate them as soon as possible. <br>
PICARD: I'm sorry, but under the circumstances, until we know what's
going on I'm imposing a full quarantine on Darwin Station. <br>
KINGSLEY: But the children have been in protective isolation since this
was detected. They show no symptoms. You cannot leave them here to die!
<br>
PICARD: Doctor, our options in a quarantine situation are extremely
limited. We are going to consider the possibilities. I suggest you do
the same. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Observation lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: I recommend against contact, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Number One? <br>
RIKER: I have to agree, sir. I wish there was something we could do,
but the risk is too great. <br>
PICARD: Doctor? <br>
PULASKI: If the children are free of disease, as Doctor Kingsley said,
they should be evacuated. I would like to bring one of them aboard
within a force field for a complete examination. <br>
PICARD: Counsellor, do you sense anything? <br>
TROI: Doctor Kingsley sincerely believes the children are not a threat,
but she's not telling us the whole truth. I recommend caution. <br>
PICARD: We have only Doctor Kingsley's assurance that these children
are not infected, whereas we have seen the results of this disease
first hand. In a case like this, I think we should err on the side of
caution.&nbsp;<br>
PULASKI: All right. We could beam up one child in styrolite in
suspended animation. That way I could scan for possible infection
without any danger to ourselves or to the child. <br>
RIKER: But we don't know what we're looking for. <br>
PULASKI: Exactly. And we won't know until we begin gathering data.
Captain, that's worth some risk. <br>
PICARD: There's always risk, Doctor. Proceed with the examination, but
I shall require positive proof that these children are harmless before
I place any of my crew in jeopardy.

(A male older than twelve appears on the table) <br>
WORF: A trick! <br>

PICARD: One moment, Lieutenant. Whoever he is, he's still in stasis. <br>
PULASKI: The styrolite is intact, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Force field down. <br>
TROI: Captain, there's a definite presence, a distinct personality.
Even in stasis it's quite strong. The child is unquestionably
telepathic. <br>
PULASKI: A child this mature? We could be looking at the future of
humanity. <br>
PICARD: At least Doctor Kingsley's vision of it. <br>
(Later, as two nurses do most of the examining with various
instruments, Picard returns to the lab) <br>
PULASKI: This child is in better health than we are. His immune system
is so advanced it may not be possible for him to contract disease. I
want to free him from the styrolite. <br>
PICARD: That seems rather risky, Doctor. <br>
PULASKI: I can do no further tests until he's out of it. <br>
PICARD: But what if you're wrong? You saw what happened on the Lantree.
<br>
PULASKI: I know I'm right. <br>
PICARD: I can't expose the Enterprise until I know where this disease
came from and how it is transmitted. <br>
PULASKI: I realise that, Captain. Naturally, we'll establish a force
field containment. <br>
PICARD: But if we lose the force field for any reason, we lose the
ship. Force fields can fail, and until <br>
PULASKI: We don't have that kind of time. These children can't survive
in the lab once their parents are dead. Look at him, Captain. He's a
human being who needs our help. <br>
PICARD: But the risk is <br>
PULASKI: Minimal. <br>
PICARD: If you can demonstrate that he is biologically harmless without
risk to the crew, I'll do everything in my power to assist. And Doctor,
God knows I'm not one to discourage input, but I would appreciate it if
you'd let me finish my sentences once in a while.

be dealing with him very well. <br>
TROI: Why do you say that? <br>
PULASKI: Well, my arguments don't seem to have any affect on him. We
just end up quoting regulations to each other. He has such a consuming
dedication to his ship, he doesn't seem able to step back to see the
human side of the equation. <br>

Station crisis our most immediate concern, although Doctor Pulaski's
condition is inseparably linked with that emergency. Her safe return
and that of Commander Data must take priority, please. <br>
TROI: Shouldn't Doctor Pulaski be involved in this? <br>
RIKER: From what we've seen on the Lantree, Doctor Pulaski may not have
time to help herself. <br>
TROI: Well I suggest we beam them both back onto the ship. Commander
Data is most likely immune and surely the biofilter will <br>
O'BRIEN: The transporter's biofilter won't protect us. The boy was
transported twice already and still infected Doctor Pulaski. <br>
LAFORGE: Couldn't we adjust the biofilter? We could alter the filter to
screen out whatever it is that's causing the disease. <br>
PICARD: But we don't know what's causing the disease. We can't protect
ourselves against the unknown. What we need is some kind of filter that
doesn't depend on known biological factors. <br>
O'BRIEN: We might try the trace. <br>
RIKER: The transporter trace? <br>
O'BRIEN: As you know, the transporter keeps a record of all
transmissions, a pattern if you will. Usually it's just stored for
security purposes, but if we use the transporter trace to control the
reconstitution process <br>
LAFORGE: I don't think it's ever been tried quite that way before, but
theoretically it is possible. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'd have to make extensive modifications. <br>
PICARD: Then do it. It seems we have no alternative. <br>
RIKER: Where will we get the trace pattern? The Doctor's never used our
transporter. <br>
PICARD: Never? <br>
RIKER: No. She's a woman of very strongly held opinions, sir. What was
her previous assignment? <br>

how much I regret the burden we've imposed on you. On both of you. <br>
PULASKI: Commander Data is an android, Doctor. He is unaffected. As for
me, I chose this. I was convinced the children were safe. <br>
KINGSLEY: I still can't believe you were infected by one of our
children. <br>
DATA: The evidence is fairly conclusive. <br>
KINGSLEY: You don't understand. They were designed to resist disease. <br>
PULASKI: I think it's time we talked about that. <br>
KINGSLEY: Let me show you something. <br>
(They go up some steps to an observation window on the Isolation lab.
Seven 'children' are playing games) <br>
KINGSLEY: Our ultimate achievement. The oldest is twelve, and all are
telekinetic. Watch. <br>

PULASKI: Genetically engineered? <br>
KINGSLEY: Not engineered, created. Perfect in every way. Their body
structure, their musculature, their minds. <br>
PULASKI: You were telling me about their immune system. <br>
KINGSLEY: That was our masterpiece. We gave these children an
aggressive immunity. The rest of us were infected by the supply ship,
but they were protected. <br>
DATA: The Lantree logs indicated that only one crewman had any illness
prior to arrival here. The First Officer had a mild case of Thelusian
flu. <br>
KINGSLEY: Yes, he was one of the crewmen who came in direct contact
with us. <br>
PULASKI: The Thelusian flu would have little effect on you, but tell
me, how would they react? <br>
KINGSLEY: Their immune system would release an active antibody that
would attack the virus. <br>
PULASKI: Even at a distance? <br>
KINGSLEY: Their immune systems don't wait for a disease to attack the
body. It would seek out an airborne virus and destroy it. <br>
PULASKI: Destroy it? How, exactly? <br>
KINGSLEY: The antibody would adapt itself to alter the genetic code of
the virus. <br>
PULASKI: Commander, I want an analysis of the interaction between the
Thelusian flu and the children. <br>
DATA: On a molecular genetic level? <br>
KINGSLEY: We don't have time for that. Genetic analysis could take
months. <br>

Doctor Pulaski's transporter pattern right after she
transferred. Not that she used the transporter much, she preferred
using the shuttlecraft. I would have given her a shuttle if it would
have kept her here. <br>
PICARD: Tell me, Taggert, if she served you as well as you say, why did
you let her go? <br>
TAGGERT [on monitor]: I see you haven't run into her stubborn streak
yet. As soon as she found out about an opening on the Enterprise, she
put in a request for transfer. Knew your service record backward and
forward. Apparently she's been an admirer of yours for some time. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PULASKI: Commander, what have you got? <br>
DATA: The answer, I believe, Doctor. The Lantree was not the source of
the disease, but it was the trigger. <br>
KINGSLEY: Trigger? <br>
DATA: The Lantree's First Officer exposed your children to Thelusian
flu for the first time. Their active immune systems set out to attack
the virus, and once it was triggered, it kept going. The antibody
created an unexpected side-effect. It alters the genetic make-up of
normal humans. This is a comparison of the normal and altered DNA.
These are the two molecules that have been transposed. <br>
PULASKI: And since our DNA is self replicating, the process <br>
DATA: Is irreversible. <br>

PULASKI [on viewscreen]: I'm afraid so, Captain. The children don't
carry the disease, they are the cause. <br>
PICARD: What do you mean? <br>
PULASKI [on viewscreen]: Their advanced immune system has created an
antibody that changes normal DNA. The altered genes are the ones that
control aging. <br>
PICARD: Then why did it attack you more quickly than Doctor Kingsley? <br>
PULASKI [on viewscreen]: The enclosed environment of the shuttlecraft
concentrated my exposure. The Lantree's First Officer carried the
antibody onto his ship. It had the same effect on his crew. <br>
PICARD: Right, what's the next step? <br>
PULASKI [on viewscreen]: The children will survive, but the rest of us
are just about out of time. <br>
PICARD: Doctor, I want you back aboard this ship. We'll beam you up in
suspended animation like the boy. That will give us more time. <br>
PULASKI [on viewscreen]: Captain, I appreciate what you're trying to
do, but I got into this by leaping before I looked, and I won't allow
you to make the same mistake. Chief Medical Officer's log. This will be
my final report to the Enterprise. Just as changes in evolution are
known to be caused by changes in the environment, we now know the
process also works in reverse. An attempt to control human evolution
has resulted in a new species that's lethal to its predecessors. The
children will be condemned to live out their lives in isolation.

PICARD: You said that the transporter could be modified to filter out
the changes in Doctor Pulaski? <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir, but we were unable to locate her trace pattern. <br>
PICARD: Well, what if we used a sample of her DNA, say from a blood
test taken before she was exposed to the disease? Could that be used to
filter out the genetic changes? <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, I'd have to get into the biofilter bus to patch in a
molecular matrix reader. That's no problem. But the waveform modulator
will be overloaded without the regeneration limiter in the first stage
circuit. <br>
