EMH: Seven of Nine. How's my favourite Borg today? <br>
SEVEN: Annoyed. In the future you will announce your presence before
entering this room. <br>
EMH: Sorry. I guess I should have knocked first. <br>
SEVEN: Are we ready to leave? <br>
EMH: Yes. According to sensors, spatial conditions are ripe. A
spontaneous protonebula could emerge within the next twenty minutes.
Mister Paris is expecting us.<br>

This should be exciting, don't you think? <br>
SEVEN: It's an astronomical survey, nothing more. What is your function
on this mission? <br>
EMH: My function is to study the nebula's effects on the crew. We may
be dealing with new forms of radiation. I can't wait to see one of
these clouds take shape. I hear they're quite beautiful. I brought
along a holo-imaging device to take a few snapshots. <br>
SEVEN: This isn't shore leave. There will be no time for recreational
activities. <br>
EMH: The Borg, party poopers of the galaxy. Tomorrow we'll start you on
a new social exercise. Developing your joie de vivre. <br>

PARIS: Sorry about that. Just a little spatial turbulence. Nothing to
worry about.<br>
(Another jolt sends Torres onto the EMH's lap.) <br>
EMH: Hello there. <br>
TORRES: I don't know about you, but I've got a case of class two
claustrophobia. <br>
PARIS: Ah, I remember it well. <br>
SEVEN: Lieutenant? <br>
TORRES: Oh, that's what Starfleet cadets used to call these class two
shuttles. Fast, manoeuvrable, but not built for comfort. <br>
PARIS: They used to shoehorn half a dozen cadets into one of these
things for weeks at a time. You did not want to be around when they
opened up that airlock. <br>
SEVEN: Perhaps you should design a new shuttle. Larger, more efficient.
<br>
TORRES: Not a bad idea. <br>
SEVEN: I'm reading plasma surges off the port bow. <br>
(A red nebula bursts into existance.)<br>
TORRES: All stop. Keep our distance. <br>
EMH: Seven, move over by the helm. I want to get a group shot. <br>
SEVEN: I'm busy. <br>
EMH: And smile, like I know you can. <br>
TORRES: What was that? <br>
SEVEN: Another plasma surge. <br>

CHAKOTAY: Reset the pattern buffers. <br>
MULCHAEY: The signals are clearing. <br>

EMH: My emitter. It's been damaged. <br>
TORRES: I'll transfer your programme back to Sickbay. Hang on. <br>
(The mobile emitter falls to the deck.)<br>
EMH [OC]: Sickbay to transporter room one. Report. <br>

Commander. How'd you sleep? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Well enough. What's new? <br>
KIM: That nebula's expanding at a rate of eight thousand cubic
kilometres per hour. I've had to adjust course eleven times. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Sounds like you're enjoying the big chair. <br>
KIM: It's not a bad way to spend the night. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I hear you've been doing a fine job. The crew's impressed. Is
it true you make them call you Captain Kim? <br>
(Seven enters.)<br>
KIM: Sir? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Good morning. <br>
SEVEN: That remains to be seen. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Problem? <br>
SEVEN: The proximity transceiver in my cranial implant has been
activated. That could indicate a Borg presence nearby. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Harry? <br>
KIM: I've been running sensor sweeps all night. I haven't seen
anything. <br>
SEVEN: Perhaps the nebula is masking a vessel. <br>
KIM: No, not a chance. A ship wouldn't last ten seconds in there. Not
even a Borg cube. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe it's a false alarm. Your transceiver could be
malfunctioning. <br>
SEVEN: It is possible. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Why don't you pay a visit to Sickbay. In the meantime we'll
redouble our scans, just to be sure. <br>
SEVEN: Very well. <br>
KIM: I'll get the scans underway. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If you don't mind being an Ensign again. (Mulchaey arrives
for duty at the science lab. He enters the green lit room carefully and
starts scanning with his tricorder. But he gets too close, and tubules
lance into his neck.) </font></p>

Looks like someone's rerouting power from the warp conduits. <br>
CHAKOTAY: To where? <br>
KIM: Deck eight, section twenty two. The science lab. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Bridge to science lab. Ensign Mulchaey, respond. Harry. <br>
KIM: Sensors are being deflected by some kind of forcefield. Commander,
the forcefield has a Borg signature. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Red alert. Captain to the bridge. Tuvok, take a security team
to the science lab. Chakotay to Seven of Nine, looks like you were
right. </font></p>

CHAKOTAY [OC]: We've detected Borg on the ship. Deck eight, science
lab. <br>
SEVEN: How many drones? <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Unknown, Tuvok's headed there now. <br>
SEVEN: I will join him. <br>
EMH: The science lab? My mobile emitter's in there. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Science
lab]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Tuvok
and his team are armed with big
rifles. Seven has a hand phaser. The doors are not fully closed, so
they pull them apart. There is a new piece of equipment in the lab, a
hexagonal container with lots of tubes running into it.)<br>
SEVEN: This technology resembles a Borg maturation chamber, but many of
the components are unfamiliar. <br>
CREWMAN: Commander. <br>
(They have found Mulchaey. He is still alive.)<br>
SEVEN: He was punctured by an extraction tubule. It removed a tissue
sample. There are residual nanoprobes surrounding the wound. Their
encoding sequences are identical to my own. <br>
TUVOK: Your nanoprobes? How? <br>
SEVEN: I don't know. <br>
TUVOK: Take him to Sickbay. (Mulchaey is helped out of the lab. Seven
approaches the chamber.)<br>
TUVOK: What are you doing? <br>
SEVEN: I will be recognised as Borg. <br>
(She steps through the forcefield, and opens an iris to see inside the
chamber.)<br>
SEVEN: A drone, but unlike any I've ever seen. <br>
TUVOK: It appears to be in the foetal stage. <br>
SEVEN: I don't understand. The Borg assimilate. They do not reproduce
in this fashion. <br>
(Later, the Captain has arrived. We see from the foetus' perspective.)<br>
JANEWAY: Where did it come from? <br>
SEVEN: I believe it was created here in the science lab. When the away
team beamed back to Voyager there was a transporter malfunction. Our
patterns merged briefly. It is possible that some of my nanoprobes
infected the Doctor's mobile emitter. <br>
TUVOK: They began to assimilate? <br>
SEVEN: Yes. <br>
(Back to a normal view inside the lab.)<br>
SEVEN: Nanoprobes are encoded to utilize any technology they encounter.
Once it assimilated the emitter, it began to transform this diagnostic
station. When Ensign Mulchaey entered the room, they sampled his DNA.<br>
JANEWAY: Using his genetic code as a template to create a lifeform. <br>
TUVOK: The drone has increased in mass by seventeen percent. <br>
SEVEN: Its maturation rate is twenty five times that of a conventional
Borg. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok, erect a level ten forcefield around this section. Post
round the clock security. <br>
TUVOK: You intend to let it mature? <br>
JANEWAY: The alternative is to pull the plug, and I'm not prepared to
do that. Not unless I have to. Resume your analysis. I want to know
exactly what we're dealing with here. Or should I say whom? <br>
SEVEN: Yes, Captain. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Astrometrics
lab]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> SEVEN:
I've adapted the Astrometrics sensors to penetrate the Borg forcefield.
<br>
TORRES: I thought you said this thing was a foetus. <br>
SEVEN: An hour ago it was. The drone has entered the fourth phase of
gestation. In human terms, it is a child of six years. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: You mean a boy of six years. From what I can tell the
drone is male. Seven, route your sensor data to Sickbay. I want to run
a few medical scans. <br>
SEVEN: Stand by. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH
[OC]: Twenty seven percent of his body. <br>
TUVOK: Curious. His body plating is composed of polydeutonic alloy <br>
EMH [on monitor]: Just like my mobile emitter. <br>
SEVEN: The nanoprobes must have extrapolated that technology. It could
explain his unique design. <br>
TORRES: Wait a minute. The Doctor's emitter came from the twenty ninth
century. It's five hundred years more advanced that anything we've got.
<br>
TUVOK: It is logical to assume this drone will be equally advanced. <br>
TORRES: A twenty ninth century Borg. <br>
TUVOK: In essence. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: I've located my mobile emitter. It's embedded in his
cerebral cortex. <br>
SEVEN: The emitter has been adapted to serve as part of his central
nervous system. It controls all autonomic functions. <br>
EMH: That means we can't remove it. Not without killing the drone. <br>
TUVOK: Has it contacted the Borg Collective? <br>
SEVEN: No. I have dampened it's proximity transceiver. <br>
TORRES: For now. What about when it grows up? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Ready
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Reactive body armour? Multidimensional adaptability? Internal
transporter nodes? <br>
SEVEN: The drone possesses superior technology. It will fully mature in
less than two hours. However, its Borg shielding is not yet active. We
can still terminate it, but we must act quickly. <br>
JANEWAY: Hold on a minute, Seven. I want some answers first. What
normally happens when a drone disengages from the maturation chamber? <br>
SEVEN: It awaits instructions from the Collective. <br>
JANEWAY: So without those instructions, it has no designation, right?
No purpose. <br>
SEVEN: Correct. <br>
JANEWAY: If we can keep him from interfacing with the Collective, maybe
we can give him a purpose. <br>
SEVEN: Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: This is the most advanced drone ever to exist. We could teach
him our values, Seven. We could show him what it means to be an
individual. <br>
SEVEN: If we fail, if the drone were to be assimilated the Collective
would become far more powerful. <br>
JANEWAY: What I'm proposing is the only defence we have against that
possibility, short of murder, and that's an order I'd prefer not to
give. As I recall, Seven, there were a few crew members who had similar
doubts about you. <br>
SEVEN: The situation is different. <br>
JANEWAY: Is it? A Borg, disconnected from the Collective, unsure of its
identity? A potential threat, but we succeeded. We're going to pull the
same trick again, only this time you're going to be the teacher. <br>
SEVEN: I am to instruct the drone in the ways of humanity. <br>
JANEWAY: Think of it as first contact, and you are our ambassador. </font></p>

SEVEN: Designation is irrelevant. You are not part of the Collective.
You are an individual. You will receive your instructions from me. <br>
ONE: Insufficient. <br>
SEVEN: You must comply. <br>
ONE: Insufficient. We are Borg. <br>
SEVEN: My designation is Seven of Nine, tertiary adjunct of Unimatrix
zero one. You may call me Seven of Nine. <br>

SEVEN: You will comply with my commands. <br>
ONE: Seven of Nine. <br>
SEVEN: Yes. We are not Borg. We are individuals. Do you understand? <br>
ONE: State our designation. <br>
TUVOK: Apparently not. <br>
SEVEN: The drone's responses are programmed. It doesn't understand what
I'm saying. I must initiate a direct neural interface. <br>
TUVOK: Are you sure that's wise? <br>
SEVEN: There is no other way for me to communicate with it. <br>
TUVOK: Proceed. (Seven holds out her left fist and the drone steps
backwards.)<br>
SEVEN: You will not be harmed. Resistance is futile. <br>
(It steps forward again. Seven projects a pair of tubules into its
neck.)<br>
SEVEN: I am providing it with instructions. It understands. <br>
(It grabs her wrist.)<br>
SEVEN: The drone is probing my neural pathways. It is trying to
assimilate all of my knowledge. I cannot disengage the link. <br>
(Tuvok's phaser is ineffective.)<br>
SEVEN: Terminate interface! You must comply. You are hurting me. <br>
ONE: I will comply. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> Daily
log, Seven of Nine. I've activated the drone's linguistic database. It
is now capable of assimilating information. A direct neural link is too

helpless. <br>

providing power for faster than light propulsion. <br>
SEVEN: Correct. <br>
TORRES: This isn't a classroom, Seven. <br>
SEVEN: Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres, Chief Engineer. Klingon human
hybrid. She possesses extensive knowledge of this vessel's systems as
well as a volatile temperament. <br>
ONE: Volatile. English adjective meaning readily vaporisable at low
temperature. Easily aroused. Tending to violent eruption. <br>
TORRES: Very good. You get a gold star. <br>
SEVEN: Our presence here is authorised. The Captain asked me to
familiarise the drone with Voyager. <br>
TORRES: Well, how about familiarising him with the Airponics bay. I
have got one hour to come up with a way to predict the expansion rate
of this protonebula or Janeway's going to pull the plug on the entire
survey. Do you mind? <br>
ONE: If you apply a multispatial algorithm it will accurately predict
the rate of expansion. I can demonstrate. <br>
TORRES: All right. <br>
(The drone works quickly at a console.)<br>
TORRES: Amazing. </font></p>

Greetings. Our designation, my designation is One. How are you today? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm just fine, thank you. One? <br>
SEVEN: He requested a designation. One seemed appropriate. <br>
JANEWAY: And how are you today, One? <br>
ONE: Well. Thank you, Captain Janeway. <br>
JANEWAY: Adapting to life on Voyager? <br>
ONE: Yes. To date I've assimilated forty seven billion terraquads of
information on a vast variety of subjects, including particle physics,
comparative humanoid anatomy, warp field theory, and the culinary
delights of the Delta quadrant. <br>
SEVEN: Mister Neelix. They've been spending time together. <br>
ONE: Is your assessment of me complete? Am I sufficient? <br>
JANEWAY: Why, yes. More than sufficient. In fact, I'd say you were
making excellent progress. And this isn't an assessment, One. I simply
wanted to meet you. <br>
ONE: With your permission, I would like to be excused. I've agreed to
assist Lieutenant Torres. She wishes to increase the efficiency of the
Bussard collectors. <br>
JANEWAY: Permission granted. <br>
(One leaves. A security officer follows him.)<br>
JANEWAY: You've done a remarkable job. <br>
SEVEN: Thank you. <br>
JANEWAY: Not only has he absorbed an incredible amount of knowledge in
a matter of days, but he seems to be fitting in with the crew and
developing a distinct personality. <br>
SEVEN: He is adapting quickly. <br>
JANEWAY: Then why do I get the feeling something's bothering you. <br>
SEVEN: He's been expressing curiosity about the Borg. <br>
JANEWAY: Ah. And you're worried that if he learns about them he may be
drawn to the Collective. <br>
SEVEN: Yes. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe we should tell him what he wants to know. I'd rather he
learned about the Borg from us than the Collective. <br>
SEVEN: The lure of perfection is powerful, Captain. He may be tempted
to seek out the Borg. That would pose a grave tactical risk. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, we can delay telling him for now, but keep in mind the
drone is becoming an individual. Seven, he has the right to know.
Sooner or later, we'll have to answer his questions. </font></p>

SEVEN: You have assimilated enough for one day. You've also provided
invaluable assistance to the Voyager crew. You have exceeded
expectations. <br>
ONE: Then expectations were insufficient. <br>
SEVEN: A simple thank you would suffice. <br>
ONE: Thank you? <br>
SEVEN: A customary expression of gratitude. I paid you a compliment. We
must regenerate. <br>
ONE: This technology does not conform with Starfleet parameters. <br>
SEVEN: Correct. <br>

ONE: The Borg have assimilated thousands of species. <br>
SEVEN: Correct. <br>
ONE: What becomes of those species? <br>
SEVEN: Their neural pathways are restructured and linked to a single
collective mind, the Hive. Their bodies are augmented with cybernetic
technology. They become drones. <br>
ONE: I wish to experience the hive mind. <br>
JANEWAY: If you did that, you'd no longer be unique. The Borg would
destroy your individuality. <br>
ONE: And that is undesirable? <br>
JANEWAY: Very. The Borg are the most destructive force we've ever
encountered. They've assimilated billions of individuals against their
will. <br>
ONE: You were assimilated. <br>
SEVEN: My link to the Collective was severed. <br>
ONE: When you were in the Collective you assimilated others. <br>
SEVEN: Yes. <br>
ONE: You call the Borg destructive. Seven of Nine is not. <br>
JANEWAY: That's because she's regained her individuality. If the Borg
had the chance, they'd take it away from her again. They'd assimilate
everyone on Voyager. With your advanced technology, the Collective
would become even more destructive. We have to prevent that from
happening but we can't do it without you. We need your abilities to
enhance our defences, shields, weapons. Will you help us resist them? <br>
ONE: Seven of Nine, do you wish to rejoin the Collective? <br>
SEVEN: Voyager is my Collective. <br>
