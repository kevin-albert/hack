klaxon sounds, attracting raggedy men from various cubby holes.) <br>
MAN [OC]: New man coming! <br>
MAN 2 [OC]: New prisoner. <br>
MAN [OC]: Get out of my way! <br>
MAN 2 [OC]: There is a new man coming. <br>
MAN 3 [OC]: Here he comes. <br>
MAN 2 [OC]: Hurry up. <br>
MAN [OC]: New prisoner! <br>
MAN 2 [OC]: Hey, something's coming. <br>
(An iris opens at the top of a chute and a person slides down, landing
with a thump. Laughter from the assembled men, who suggest taking his
boots or killing him. A grizzled man pushes through the crowd.) <br>
PIT: Get out of my way. <br>
(He pulls Harry Kim, for it is he, to his feet. A fight starts, and Kim
manages to get in a few punches of his own before he is kicked to the
ground.) <br>
MAN: Kill him, kill him. <br>
(A fair haired man intervenes.) <br>
KIM: Tom. <br>
(Paris punches Kim in the stomach. He goes down.) <br>
PIT: Nobody touch him. He's mine. <br>
(Pit starts to drag Kim away by the foot.) <br>
KIM: Wait. This is a mistake. I don't belong here! <br>
PIT: You don't? Well, I'll just take you home then. All right? <br>
PARIS: This one's mine. <br>
PIT: I say he's not. <br>
PARIS: He's the reason that I'm here. He was my partner in a bombing.
We killed forty seven patrollers at Akritiri. Forty seven! And then
this scum confessed to the Tribunal and gave them my name. So I'm
telling you again, he's mine. <br>
PIT: I'm keeping him. <br>
(Paris gets a knife to Pit's throat.) <br>
PIT: Take him. For now.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM: Did
you have to hit me so hard? <br>
PARIS: Trust me. Around here, you don't want anybody thinking you're
soft. <br>
KIM: Thanks for the tip. Is there any food? <br>
PARIS: I haven't had anything to eat since I got here. <br>
KIM: How long is that? <br>
PARIS: Couple of days. Some shore leave, huh? What happened to you
after they split us up? <br>
KIM: The Akritirians interrogated me. When I wouldn't confess to the
bombing, they dragged me in front of a judge. He said you'd already
confessed for the both of us, then he pronounced me guilty. <br>
PARIS: That's exactly what happened to me. Then they must have drugged
me, because the next thing I knew, I woke up at the bottom of the chute
to that welcoming party. <br>
KIM: We've got to explain to somebody that there's been a mistake. <br>
PARIS: Who did you have in mind? <br>
KIM: A guard, the warden. <br>
PARIS: Haven't seen anybody like that. <br>
KIM: A prison without guards. <br>
PARIS: The other inmates say this place is three hundred metres
underground. Maybe the Akritirians figure guards aren't necessary. <br>
(Kim holds out a cup.) <br>
KIM: Can I have some more? <br>
PARIS: What do you think this is, a hotel? There isn't any more! <br>
KIM: Take it easy. <br>
PARIS: I'm sorry. I'm really starting to get edgy. I think it's the
clamp. <br>
KIM: The what? <br>
(Paris shows him a small metal object embedded in the back of his
skull.) <br>
PARIS: That's what the prisoners call it. Everybody has one. <br>
KIM: What is it? <br>
PARIS: I'm guessing it's some kind of synaptic stimulator. Anyway, it's
affecting my nervous system. I've been getting jumpier ever since I got
here, not to mention this thing itches like crazy. <br>
KIM: What do you think it's for? <br>
PARIS: Maybe it's some kind of torture device. <br>
KIM: We could try taking them out. <br>
PARIS: No! I saw someone try it. It killed him! What we have to do is
find a way out of this place. <br>
KIM: Let's get something straight first. <br>
PARIS: What? <br>
KIM: The next time you take a swing at me, I'm hitting back. <br>
(The klaxon sounds.) <br>
KIM: What's that? <br>
PARIS: Another prisoner, maybe. <br>
MAN [OC]: Food! Food! <br>
PARIS: Join me for dinner? </font></p>

slabs of something are slid down the chute. There is much scrabbling
and stamping on hands to get as much as possible as quickly as
possible.)&nbsp;<br>
MAN: Oh, there's got to be more! <br>
(He reaches to the iris and gets zapped. He falls back. Another
prisoner gets his throat slit for the food he had
collected. His murderer is very casual about it all.) <br>
ZIO: I don't think he was going to eat it anyway, do you? <br>
KIM: He's dead. <br>
PARIS: I think I've lost my appetite.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Captain's
log, stardate 50156.2. After seventy two hours, Lieutenant Paris and
Ensign Kim are still missing, and I'm quickly losing patience with the
Akritirian authorities. They continue to deny us access to the surface,
and they've yet to confirm whether our crewmen were killed in the
bombing.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Anything? <br>
TUVOK: I have completed another full sensor sweep, including
multispectral subsurface scan. I still can not locate their life signs
or their comm. badges. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, Ambassador Liria is hailing us. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. I'm only in a mood for good news today, Ambassador.
<br>
LIRIA [on viewscreen]: I'm afraid I can't oblige. <br>
JANEWAY: Are you saying they're dead? <br>
LIRIA [on viewscreen]: No, they're very much alive. <br>
JANEWAY: Then where are they? <br>
LIRIA [on viewscreen]: Your men have been convicted of the terrorist
bombing at the Laktivia recreational facility, which resulted in the
death of forty seven off-duty patrollers. <br>
JANEWAY: I assure you, Ambassador, my people had nothing to do with
this attack. <br>
LIRIA [on viewscreen]: We found chemical traces of the explosive used
in the bombing on their hands and clothing. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm sure the same could be said of anyone who was near the
explosion. It's hardly enough evidence for a conviction. <br>
LIRIA [on viewscreen]: The explosive was trilithium based. There is no
source of trilithium anywhere in our system. So, you can imagine our
surprise when our investigation revealed that your ship is powered by
dilithium, which our scientists tell us is convertible into trilithium.
We have long suspected that the so-called Open Sky Terrorists had
off-world collaborators. Now we know who they are. <br>
TUVOK: Captain, two Akritirian ships are approaching at bearing two
seven one, mark six four. <br>
LIRIA [on viewscreen]: Prepare your ship for inspection, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: If it will help confirm our innocence, I'll consider it. But
first I want to know where my people are being held, and I want to talk
to them immediately. <br>
LIRIA [on viewscreen]: Communication with inmates is not permitted. <br>
JANEWAY: If you want my co-operation, Ambassador, you're going to have
to do better than that. <br>
LIRIA [on viewscreen]: Perhaps you've misunderstood me. Let me clarify
our position. Your vessel is being impounded. You and your crew are
under arrest. Prepare to be boarded. <br>
TUVOK: Captain, their ships are powering weapons. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok, raise shields. Mister Chakotay, take the conn.
I'd like to resolve this situation peacefully, Ambassador, but let me
clarify my position. I will not allow this ship to be boarded. <br>
LIRIA [on viewscreen]: That, Captain, is an error in judgement. <br>
(The two small ships open fire, rocking Voyager.) <br>
TUVOK: Captain, should I return fire? <br>
JANEWAY: That's not going to help us get Tom and Harry back. We need to
regroup. Get us out of here, Commander. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Paris'

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM:
What took you so long? I've been back at least half an hour. <br>
PARIS: You're starting to feel it, aren't you? <br>
KIM: I guess I am. <br>
PARIS: It gets worse all the time. We have to fight it. Let's focus on
something positive. <br>
KIM: How about a seven course dinner? I suppose you didn't find any
food. <br>
PARIS: Er, well, I found close to fifty good citizens in this quaint
little community, but not a grocer among them. <br>
KIM: I take it that's a no. <br>
PARIS: Yeah. But if we ever do get our hands on some food, I found a
lovely spot for a picnic. <br>
KIM: Great. All we need are the Delaney sisters and we could make a day
of it. <br>
PARIS: So how about you? Come across anything interesting in your
travels? <br>
KIM: If you mean an escape route, I ran into nothing but solid walls. <br>
PARIS: Me too. As far as I can see, the only way to the surface is that
chute in the main chamber. <br>
KIM: Question is, how do we get into it without getting fried by that
forcefield? You saw what happened to the man who reached inside. <br>
PARIS: That's where this might come in handy. <br>
(A piece of metal piping.) <br>
PARIS: I thought if we could get our hands on some loose wiring, you
might be able to use it to rig a device that would short out the
forcefield long enough for us to get into the tube. <br>
KIM: It's worth a try. <br>
PARIS: Yeah. Now if we could only figure out a way to short out these
implants, we'd be all set.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Briefing
room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CHAKOTAY:
There's no indication they followed us. <br>
JANEWAY: I guess they're more interested in getting rid of us than
finding out the truth. <br>
TORRES: We've got to go back for Harry and Tom. <br>
JANEWAY: B'Elanna. <br>
TUVOK: We have no information as to their whereabouts. And if we return
to Akritirian space, we are sure to encounter further hostilities. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok is right. Let's concentrate on proving Harry and Tom's
innocence. <br>
TORRES: How do we do that? <br>
JANEWAY: We know the explosive was trilithium based. If we find the
source of that trilithium, it may lead us to the real bombers. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Our long range scans indicate that Liria was right. There's
no trilithium in this sector. <br>
TORRES: What about paralithium? It's used as a fuel for some ion based
propulsion systems, and it can be converted into trilithium. <br>
JANEWAY: Review our sensor logs of ships entering and leaving
Akritirian space during the time we were in orbit. If anybody's using
paralithium for fuel, I want to find out who they are and where they
went.

KIM: Come on, come on, come on. <br>
PARIS: Take it easy. You'll get it. <br>
KIM: Damn! I can't think! I can't concentrate! <br>
PARIS: Okay. Okay, concentrate on this. Crown roast of lamb, with a bed
of wild rice, and a 2296 Chateau Lafitte Rothschild at the real
Sandrine's. <br>
KIM: Or how about shrimp with fettran sauce, flambé noodles and fudge
ripple pudding. <br>
PARIS: Good one. Okay. A couple of barbecued T-bone steaks with baked
Risan beans and cherry pie for dessert. Let's see you top that one. <br>
KIM: Right now, I'm so hungry I could eat a bowl of Neelix's leola root
stew. <br>
PARIS: Me too. Never thought I'd say that. <br>
KIM: I'm ready to give it a try. So far, so good. <br>
(Kim touches the forcefield with the pipe, and gets thrown backwards.) <br>
PARIS: Are you okay? <br>
PIT: What are you doing? <br>
PARIS: Just out for a little stroll. (to Kim) Move it! <br>
PIT: What's that? <br>
KIM: A pipe. <br>
PIT: Let's see it. <br>
PARIS: Come on. I'd really recommend that you stay out of my way. <br>
PIT: You should have thought of that before you took him. <br>
(Other prisoners grab Kim as Pit slashes at Paris with his knife. Paris
fights back.) <br>
KIM: Come on, Tom. <br>
(Paris knocks Pit down, and gets stabbed by another prisoner.) <br>
KIM: Tom! <br>
(Kim breaks free and goes to Paris' help, swinging the metal pipe.) <br>
KIM: Back off! Back off! Back off! Back off! Hang on. I'm getting you
out of here. <br>
ZIO: No fight, no fight. If he doesn't bleed to death, he'll die from
infection. <br>
KIM: We've got to get him to a doctor. <br>
ZIO: Of course. We'll call an emergency vehicle and rush him to a
hospital. <br>
(Kim pushes Zio away and carries Paris off.) <br>
ZIO: Hey! What do you want for the dead man's boots? <br>
(On the way to the hovel.) <br>
KIM: You can make it. Just a few more steps and we'll be back to the
shelter. <br>
PARIS: Home sweet home. Harry. <br>
KIM: Yeah. <br>
PARIS: I'm hurt pretty bad. <br>
KIM: I'll take care of it. <br>
PARIS: Promise me something. <br>
KIM: What? <br>
PARIS: If things get worse, if it comes down to making a choice, don't
worry about me. Take care of yourself. Do we have a deal? <br>

KIM: Just tell me what you want for the food and the bandages, okay? <br>
ZIO: That pipe you were working with interests me. <br>
KIM: I can't trade the pipe. <br>
ZIO: Then I guess we don't have a deal. Now move on. You're blocking my
light. <br>
KIM: I'll take you with me. <br>
ZIO: Take me where? <br>
KIM: I know a way out of this place. <br>
ZIO: I've been in here six years. I've never heard of a way out. <br>
KIM: The chute. <br>
ZIO: Anybody that tries to get in there gets hit with an energy pulse. <br>
KIM: With this pipe, I can disable the forcefield. With a little luck,
we can make it to the surface. What are you staring at? <br>
ZIO: I'm trying to figure out if you're a liar, or if the clamp has
already made you crazy. <br>
KIM: Neither. And I'll prove it to you. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CHAKOTAY:
We're in hailing range of the Akritirian freighter, Captain. <br>
TUVOK: I'm only reading two life signs aboard. <br>
JANEWAY: Open a channel. This is Kathryn Janeway of the Federation
Starship Voyager to the captain of the Akritirian cargo vessel. <br>
(A young man and woman appear on the viewscreen. The man speaks.) <br>
VEL [on viewscreen]: I'm the captain of this vessel. What do you want? <br>
JANEWAY: Two of my crew members were convicted by the Akritirians of a
terrorist bombing. We're trying to prove their innocence, and we have
reason to believe a ship like yours, which uses paralithium for fuel,
might have been involved in the production of the explosives. <br>
PIRI [on viewscreen]: Let's get out of here. <br>
VEL [on viewscreen]: Quiet. (to Janeway) This is a cargo vessel. <br>
JANEWAY: Then you won't mind if a few of my crew members come aboard to
have a look around. <br>
VEL [on viewscreen]: Not if they don't mind having their throats cut. <br>
JANEWAY: There's no need to be abrupt. <br>
(Transmission ends.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: I guess you're not the only captain who doesn't want their
ship boarded. <br>
TORRES: Captain, I'm picking up residual traces of trilithium. They're
faint but they're there. I think we may have found our bomb makers. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok, send a security detail to Transporter room two.
Lieutenant Torres, beam the two of them aboard and tractor their ship
into the shuttle bay. <br>

have no right to hold us. <br>
JANEWAY: My people have been accused of aiding a terrorist group called
Open Sky. What do you know about them? <br>
PIRI: They're not terrorists. They're patriots. One day they'll lead
the legitimate government of our people. <br>
VEL: We don't have to answer any of their questions, Piri. <br>
JANEWAY: Sounds to me like your young friend here sympathises with
these patriots. <br>
VEL: She's not my friend. She's my sister. And our political views are
none of your business. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't know much about your world, but I do know that my
people are being held for a crime they didn't commit and I'm going to
do everything in my power to get them out. Do you understand that? <br>
TUVOK: We have confirmed that explosives were indeed produced aboard
their ship. <br>
JANEWAY: Escort them to the brig. <br>
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: And have Mister Chakotay lay in a course for the Akritirian
border. <br>

and she's only fourteen. <br>
PIRI: Prison doesn't scare <br>
VEL: Quiet, Piri. Please, you don't know what you're saying. Nobody
ever gets out of prison on Akritiri. They'll just let her rot in there
for the rest of her life. <br>

really up to me, is it? <br>
PIRI: Tell them what we know. <br>
JANEWAY: Tell me what? <br>

PIRI: Our brigade found out where the maximum security detention
facility is located. <br>

out. <br>

KIM: How do I do that? I feel like there's a million fire ants in my

ZIO: Good. Make them work for you. <br>
KIM: How? <br>
ZIO: Fire ants sound vicious. Imagine them as your army moving in a
vast wave to conquer your enemy. There's a massive struggle going on
inside you, a battle to the death between you and the clamp. You have
to use whatever force you can to defeat it. <br>
KIM: I'd rather use my energy to work on getting out of here. <br>
ZIO: When I first got here, I assumed the clamp was just a refined form
of torture to make our prison stay that much more arduous. Gradually, I
began to understand it more fully. It's all right here in my manifesto.
My insights, my reasoning, my evidence. It's an experiment. They're
studying us like animals. Pitting us against each other to find out
what happens. You can see that, can't you? <br>
KIM: I guess so. <br>
ZIO: The greatest threat, of course, would be if we started to
cooperate with each other, so they prevented that. But there had to be
more to it than that. And the longer I was in here, the more I knew it
was my job to figure it out. That's the reason I was put here. And
eventually, it came to me as though a fireball had exploded in my mind.
And the realisation gave me a power over the others. They don't come
near me any more. They're afraid of me because I know the truth. Well?
Don't you want to know what it is? What is the ultimate purpose of the
clamp? <br>
KIM: Okay. <br>
ZIO: It's inspired. Brilliant. It's a method for controlling the prison
population. We kill each other off. <br>
KIM: Sure. Whatever you say. <br>
ZIO: So you must enter into the battle. If you let the clamp control
you, you'll end up like that crazy old man that took over your shelter.
But if you learn to control it, you'll survive. Like me. <br>

could get aboard the ship. <br>
ZIO: It's getting the best of you. <br>
KIM: I know we could do it. <br>
ZIO: You think they're just going to open the hatch and ask us if we'd
like a ride home? <br>
KIM: We'd have the element of surprise. <br>
ZIO: And they'd have the pulse guns. <br>
KIM: If we could hold them off, distract them, just for a few minutes,
I could establish our location, get a message to Voyager, and they
could get us out of here. We'll need weapons. <br>
ZIO: I've never let anyone see this, but I'm going to let you read my
manifesto. It'll teach you how to control the clamp. <br>
KIM: I don't want to read your crazy manifesto. <br>
ZIO: Take it. Learn everything I know. <br>
(Kim knocks the papers out of Zio's hand.) <br>
KIM: Now, are you going to help me or not? <br>
ZIO: If I were like the others, I'd kill you. But I don't lose control.
That's the difference between me and you.

Listen! Listen to me, everybody! This is important. I've got something
to say. Something you'll want to hear. It's what you've been waiting
for. <br>
PIT: What the hell do you want? <br>
KIM: I've found a way out of here. <br>
PIT: There's no way out. <br>
KIM: There is! Through the chute! I've been inside! Listen! We have to
work together! They'd like us all to kill each other, but we have to
cooperate. If we do, we can get out of here. <br>
PIT: If you've been in the chute, where does it lead? <br>
ALL: Yeah! Yeah! <br>
KIM: Space. It's the truth! We can escape, if we work together! <br>

ZIO: No, that's where you're wrong. He's too far gone to be your
friend. All he is now is a burden. <br>
KIM: That's not true! <br>
ZIO: He eats your food. He ruined your device. He's given in to the
clamp. You've got to get rid of him before he brings you down with him.
<br>
KIM: Quiet! <br>
ZIO: You've got a chance to make something of your life in here, but as
long as that carcass is in my hut, we'll never be able to go on to more
important things. <br>
KIM: What the hell are you talking about? <br>
ZIO: We've got to disseminate the manifesto. Gather our followers.
Train them. <br>
KIM: You're insane. <br>
ZIO: You want my protection? You want to live under my roof? Get rid of
him. <br>
KIM: I don't need your protection! <br>
ZIO: How long do you think you'll last against Pit and the others
without me looking out for you? <br>
(Zio offers Kim a bloodied, chipped, knife.) <br>
ZIO: Go ahead, take it. Think of what a relief it will be not to have
that responsibility, and be free of his ranting. <br>
(Kim takes the knife.) <br>
KIM: I'm not a killer. <br>
ZIO: Do you want to survive in here? You'd better learn to be. <br>
KIM: If that's what it takes to stay alive, then I'd rather die. <br>

vessel, Captain, I suggest that you do not proceed across our border. <br>
JANEWAY: We've captured the ship and crew responsible for the bombing
at the Laktivia canteen. <br>
LIRIA [on viewscreen]: I see. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm prepared to trade them for the immediate and unconditional
release of Lieutenant Paris and Ensign Kim. <br>
LIRIA [on viewscreen]: Your crewmen have already been tried and
convicted. <br>
JANEWAY: Are you saying those convictions can't be reversed? No matter
what new evidence is brought to light? <br>
LIRIA [on viewscreen]: You are correct. <br>
JANEWAY: That is an outrageous policy. <br>
LIRIA [on viewscreen]: I assure you, it has proved to be a most
effective deterrent. Good day, Captain. <br>

CHAKOTAY: So much for negotiating. <br>

I want the location and shield codes of the maximum security detention
facility. <br>
VEL: What's wrong? the Akritirians didn't agree to your terms? <br>
JANEWAY: No, as a matter of fact. But I suspect you will. <br>
VEL: And what makes you so sure? <br>
JANEWAY: Because if you don't, you and your sister are going to spend
the rest of your lives in prison. <br>
VEL: I'll take you to the prison. And I'll get you in. But there are
members of Open Sky in there and I want to get them out too. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't think you understand the way this works. You tell me
what I want to know, and after I get my people back, I let you and your
sister go. <br>
VEL: That's not good enough. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok, inform the Akritirians that we're ready to turn
the prisoners over. <br>
VEL: All right. <br>
TUVOK: Crewman Foster, take the prisoner to Commander Chakotay. He will
upload the coordinates and codes. <br>
(Ms Foster takes Vel onto the bridge.) <br>
TUVOK: May I ask how you propose to get past the Akritirian patrols? No
doubt they will attack as soon as Voyager crosses the border. <br>
JANEWAY: That's exactly why the rescue team won't be aboard Voyager. <br>
TUVOK: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: If I'm not mistaken, Mister Neelix's ship is still in our
shuttle bay. <br>
TUVOK: Yes. However, Mister Neelix's vessel has extremely limited
combat capabilities. <br>
JANEWAY: Then we'll have to be very careful, won't we?

I've always thought of my piloting skills as modest at best, and the
conditions were extremely dangerous. Still, I did outmanoeuvre those
Akritirians, didn't I? <br>
PARIS: You did a terrific job, Neelix. <br>
JANEWAY: I agree. Excellent piloting. <br>
NEELIX: I'm glad to hear you say that, Captain, because I've been
thinking. Until Tom here gets back on his feet, perhaps I could, er,
try my hand at conn for a while. <br>
EMH: That won't be necessary. Lieutenant Paris is just fine, thanks to
excellent doctoring. I've finished analysing these implants, and you'll
be happy to know that the treatment I've provided will successfully
counteract their effect on you. <br>
JANEWAY: What exactly was the effect? <br>
EMH: My readings indicate that the implants are designed to stimulate
the production of acetylcholine in the hypothalamus. <br>
KES: That would explain the agitation. <br>
EMH: Hmm. Acetylcholine is a brain chemical common to the neural
structures of most humanoids. Essentially, it helps stimulate one's
aggressive tendencies. <br>
KIM: Zio was right. <br>
PARIS: Come on, Harry. We're overdue for that steak dinner. <br>
