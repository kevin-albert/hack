We're here to commemorate our honoured dead. Lieutenant William Yates,
Lieutenant John Molar, Ensign Dorothy Chang, Ensign Edward Regis and
Crewman David Amantes, who all served with distinction. Their bravery
and sacrifice will not be forgotten. They will be missed, but now there
is cause for optimism. Captain Janeway, Voyager, on behalf of my crew,
thank you. <br>
JANEWAY: We'll have time to give the newest members of our family a
proper welcome in the days ahead, but right now, we've got our hands
full. The Equinox is secure, but its primary systems are still badly
damaged. Harry, B'Elanna, make it your priority. Captain Ransom has
provided us with data regarding the alien attacks. Tuvok, Seven, you'll
be working with First Officer Maxwell Burke. To kindred spirits. May
our journey home together be swift. Dismissed. <br>
TUVOK: We should begin by familiarising you with Voyager's defences. <br>
BURKE: Can you give me a minute? There's someone I'd like to say hello
to first. <br>
SEVEN: We'll be in the Astrometrics lab. Deck eight, section twenty
nine. <br>

TORRES: For a while. Until I ran into these two. <br>
PARIS: And it's been hell ever since. <br>
BURKE: Well, I told your resident Vulcan I'd be right with him. Are you

Commander? I've been assigned to one of the repair crews on the

one on Voyager. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Problem? <br>
GILMORE: Just a little post-traumatic stress syndrome. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Bad memories? <br>
GILMORE: A few. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Actually, I could use someone with your engineering
abilities. <br>

bulkheads and missing deck plates. <br>

happy to go back. <br>

engineering abilities. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Astrometrics
lab]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
I've run a thermographic analysis of our shields. It revealed multiple
stress points. We believe they're the result of alien attempts to
infiltrate our vessels. Each time a fissure opens within a metre of our
shields it weakens them by point three percent. <br>
JANEWAY: At the present rate, we have less than two days to mount a
defence. <br>
SEVEN: According to your bio-scans the aliens can survive in our realm
for only several seconds. <br>
RANSOM: They're like fish out of water, but they can do a lot of damage
in those seconds. <br>
TUVOK: Nevertheless, it is a tactical weakness. Perhaps we can exploit
it. <br>
BURKE: What have you got in mind? <br>
SEVEN: If we can show them we have the ability to hold them here,
they'll think twice before launching another attack. <br>
JANEWAY: But the question is, how do we catch these fish? <br>
BURKE: You build a net. <br>
JANEWAY: Commander? <br>
BURKE: A multiphasic force field to be exact. We wanted to see what we
were up against so we built a small chamber that could keep one of them
trapped for several minutes. <br>
JANEWAY: If we could expand on that technology, we might be able to
create a lattice work of multiphasic forcefields around both ships. <br>
BURKE: Rudy? <br>
RANSOM: If Captain Janeway agrees. <br>
JANEWAY: We'll need to examine that stasis chamber. <br>
RANSOM: I'm afraid that won't be possible. It's in our research lab.
That whole section was flooded with thermionic radiation during the
last attack. It'll be days before anyone can go in there. <br>
BURKE: The design schematics are in our auxiliary datacore. <br>
RANSOM: I'll see if I can download them. You give me a hand?

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
I couldn't help but notice your crew calls you by your first name. <br>
RANSOM: When you've been in the trenches as long as we have, rank and
protocol are luxuries. Besides, we're a long way from Starfleet
Command. <br>
JANEWAY: I know the feeling. <br>
RANSOM: You seem to run a pretty tight ship. <br>
JANEWAY: We've been known to let our hair down from time to time. But I
find that maintaining protocol reminds us of where we came from and
hopefully, where we're going. <br>
RANSOM: It seems to work quite well for you. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, we've overcome our share of obstacles, Warp core breaches,
ion storms, a few rounds with the Borg <br>
RANSOM: The Borg? We haven't seen so much as a Cube since the day we
arrived. <br>
JANEWAY: Consider yourself lucky. <br>
RANSOM: Have you ever run into the Krowtonan Guard? <br>
JANEWAY: Never heard of them. <br>
RANSOM: That's how we spent our first week in the Delta Quadrant. They
claimed we violated their territory. I gave the order to keep going. I
lost thirty nine. Half my crew. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry. <br>
RANSOM: We never recovered from that loss. It changed everything. <br>
JANEWAY: What do you mean? <br>
RANSOM: When I first realised that we'd be travelling across the Delta
Quadrant for the rest of our lives, I told my crew that we had a duty
as
Starfleet officers to expand our knowledge and uphold our principles.
After a couple of years, we started to forget that we were explorers.
And there were times when we nearly forgot that we were human beings. <br>
JANEWAY: This is a Nova class science vessel, designed for short term
research missions. Minimal weapons. It can't even go faster than warp
eight. Frankly, I don't know how you've done it. You've obviously
travelled as far as we have with much fewer resources. <br>
RANSOM: I wish that I could take all the credit, but we stumbled across
a wormhole, and made a few enhancements on our warp engines. I'd like
to ask you something, Captain to Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Mmm hmm. <br>
RANSOM: The Prime Directive. How often have you broken it for the sake
of protecting your crew? <br>
JANEWAY: Broken it? Never. Bent it on occasion. And even then it was a
difficult choice. What about you? <br>
RANSOM: I've walked the line once or twice, but nothing serious. There
you are. <br>(He has found the Equinox' bridge plaque.)<br>

people will never understand. <br>
BURKE: They're going to find out eventually. <br>
RANSOM: Not if we keep them out of the research lab, and away from the
warp core injectors. And be careful what you say around their crew. That includes old girlfriends. <br>

We've examined the schematics of your multiphasic chamber. It can be
adapted. We intend to create an auto-initiating security grid. <br>
TUVOK: The moment an alien invades either ship, a forcefield will
surround it. <br>
SEVEN: Once we modify our field generator to emit multiphasic
frequencies, it will power the security grids on both ships. <br>
JANEWAY: How long will it take? <br>
TUVOK: Approximately fourteen hours. <br>
GILMORE: We don't know when they'll break through again. We may not
last that long. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We could cut the time in half if we evacuate all personnel
from the Equinox and focus our efforts here on Voyager. <br>
RANSOM: Remember, we are still thirty five thousand light years from
Earth. We should try to preserve both ships. <br>
BURKE: With two vessels we'd be able to pool our resources, doubling
our chances of finding a short cut home. <br>
JANEWAY: Normally I'd agree, but right now one of our ships in
vulnerable. Chakotay's right. We should make our stand on Voyager. <br>
RANSOM: I don't want to force the issue. But I am prepared to return to
the Equinox with my crew. What is the protocol in this situation? We
have two Captains and two ships. Who gets the last word?&nbsp;<br>
JANEWAY: Starfleet Regulation one hundred ninety one, Article fourteen.
In a combat
situation involving more than one ship, command falls to the vessel
with tactical superiority. I looked it up this morning. <br>
RANSOM: Good thinking. <br>
JANEWAY: In this case, protocol recognises my authority. <br>
RANSOM: Are you ordering me to abandon my ship? <br>
JANEWAY: I'd rather not have to. <br>
RANSOM: That protocol was written in the Alpha Quadrant. I'm not sure
that it makes much sense out here. <br>
JANEWAY: The regulation stands. <br>
RANSOM: Who am I to dispute protocol? Give Captain Janeway your full
cooperation. <br>

The alien compound. Ten isograms. If I understand your calculations,
that's enough to increase your warp factor by what, point zero three
percent for one month? Unfortunately, that boost wouldn't get you very
far, so you'd need to replenish the supply and that means killing
another lifeform. And then another. How many lives would it take to get
you back to the Alpha quadrant? I think you know the reason we're under
attack. These aliens are trying to protect themselves from you. <br>
RANSOM: Sixty three. That's how many more it will take. Every time I
sacrifice one of those lives, a part of me is lost as well. <br>
JANEWAY: I might believe that if I hadn't examined your research. These
experiments were meticulous and they were brutal. If you'd felt any
remorse, you'd never have continued. <br>
RANSOM: Starfleet regulation three, paragraph twelve. In the event of
imminent destruction, a captain is authorised to preserve the lives of
his crew by any justifiable means. <br>
JANEWAY: I doubt that protocol covers mass murder. <br>
RANSOM: In my judgment, it did. <br>
JANEWAY: Unacceptable. <br>
RANSOM: We had nothing. My ship was in pieces. Our dilithium was gone.
We were running on thrusters, We hadn't eaten in sixteen days. We had
just enough power to enter orbit of an M class planet. And lucky for

rules by killing your species. It's our duty to stop them. <br>

destroying the ones who are responsible. <br>
TUVOK: We will punish them according to our own rules. They will be
imprisoned. They will lose their freedom. <br>

to you. <br>
