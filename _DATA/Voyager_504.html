BULLOCK: Welcome to Earth. I am Admiral Bullock, and I will be your
Commanding Officer for the next six months. Questions, comments, bring
them to me. Problems, talk to Lieutenant Kinis.(a Vulcan.) Larsen,
you're assigned to the Federation Council, Deputy Liaison Officer.
Young and Raskin, report to Orbital Flight Control. You'll be
monitoring incoming vessels from the Bolian sector. <br>
(Someone
is watching and taking photographs of the people. It is Chakotay, with
the EMH's holo-camera. A short time later, he is scanning a stand of
bamboo. The gardener walks up to him)<br>
BOOTHBY: I can save you some time there, son. They're bamboo. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I know that. Unfortunately, my tricorder's reading them as
maple trees. I think the isodyne relays must be malfunctioning. <br>
BOOTHBY: Why don't you pay a visit to Logistical Support? Maybe they'll
issue you a new one. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Good idea. <br>
BOOTHBY: I'm going that way myself. Mind some company? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Not at all. <br>
BOOTHBY: So, what's your assignment here? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't know. I haven't received my orders yet. I just
arrived. <br>
BOOTHBY: From where? <br>
CHAKOTAY: A three year tour on the Intrepid. <br>
BOOTHBY: Is that a fact? I thought the Intrepid was patrolling the
Neutral Zone. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It is. I caught a transport vessel at Deep Space Seven. <br>
BOOTHBY: Ah. Got tired of wrestling with the Romulans. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Let's just say it's good to be back. What about yourself? How
long have you been posted here, Mister? <br>
BOOTHBY: Boothby. Boothby's the name. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Boothby. I've heard of you. <br>
BOOTHBY: I should hope so. I've been tending these grounds for fifty
four years, give or take a few months. <br>
CHAKOTAY: And beautiful grounds they are. <br>
BOOTHBY: Mmm hmm. Logistical Support. Straight through the main
complex, second door on your right. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Thank you. <br>
BOOTHBY: Commander, Logistics is a secure area. They won't let you in
with that holo-imaging device. Fresh from the Neutral Zone? You're not
a Romulan double agent, are you, son? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Actually, I was just recording a few images for my friends
back home. Would you mind posing for a shot? <br>
BOOTHBY: Me? You want a picture of me? <br>
CHAKOTAY: The one and only Boothby. My friends would be impressed. <br>
BOOTHBY: Well, when you put it that way. Cadet, take our picture, will
you? <br>
(Chakotay hands the camera over to a &nbsp;young red-headed woman.)<br>
BOOTHBY: Don't cut off our heads. I expect a copy of that, young man. </font></p>

sits on a bar stool and opens a book left on the counter. A woman walks
up.)<br>
ARCHER: You're in my seat. And you're reading my book. Do you want my
drink, too? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Depends. What is it? <br>
ARCHER: Klingon martini. Vermouth, gin, with a dash of bloodwine. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Bloodwine? Never touch the stuff. <br>
ARCHER: What do you like? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Excuse me. I was waiting for a friend. <br>
ARCHER: Valerie Archer. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Hayek. Jason Hayek. <br>
ARCHER: Nice tattoo. I bet there's a story behind it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: A long one. A Cave Beyond Logic: Vulcan Perspectives on
Platonic Thought. Sounds fascinating. <br>
ARCHER: You can borrow it if you like. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Thanks anyway. I can only take small doses of Vulcan
philosophy. <br>
ARCHER: Stationed here? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Temporarily. <br>
ARCHER: Where do you call home? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You first. Where are you from? <br>
ARCHER: Everywhere. My parents were starship officers. By the time I
was ten I'd seen half the quadrant. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Starfleet brat. <br>
ARCHER: Bratty as they come. <br>
(There
is a crash as a chair is knocked over. A man is clutching at his throat
while his face wibbles. His friends drag him away.)<br>
ARCHER: Can I ask you a question. Have you ever reverted? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Reverted? Not yet. <br>
ARCHER: Ensign O'Halloran, this is his third time this week. If it
happens again, they'll pull him out of training. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What about you. Any trouble? <br>
ARCHER: Oh, I can keep my human form. It's the little things that
bother me. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Little things? <br>
ARCHER: Breathing oxygen, bipedal locomotion, and sleeping. The concept
of being unconscious for eight hours a night, it's so alien. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I know what you mean. <br>
ARCHER: That's why I started reading their books. For some reason it
helps me relax. But we shouldn't be talking about this. Think human,
talk human, be human. Remember? <br>
CHAKOTAY: How could I forget? <br>
ARCHER: So, had a chance to take a look around? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Not yet. <br>
ARCHER: Headquarters has a lot more to offer than conference rooms and
consoles, if you have the right guide. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Is that an invitation? <br>
ARCHER: I get off duty at nineteen hundred hours. <br>
TUVOK: Commander. <br>
ARCHER: Speak of the devil. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We were just discussing Vulcan philosophy. <br>
ARCHER: Join us. <br>
TUVOK: Another time, perhaps. We have work to do. <br>
ARCHER: Oh, can't it wait? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm afraid not. <br>
ARCHER: What about tonight? Do we have a date? Nineteen hundred hours.
Meet you right here. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'll do my best. <br>
ARCHER: Live long and prosper. <br>
(Chakotay and Tuvok walk away.)<br>
TUVOK: A date? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Relax, Tuvok. I plan on standing her up. <br>
TUVOK: We agreed to limit our investigation to surveillance. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It was worth the risk. She talked about training. These are
some kind of aliens learning to pose as humans. <br>
TUVOK: For what purpose? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't know. I didn't get that far. <br>
TUVOK: We're due back at the transporter coordinates. </font></p>

Excuse me, gentlemen. You've entered a restricted area. Captains and
above. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Sorry. We didn't realise.<br>
GENTRY: I'm going to have to ask you to come with me. <br>
TUVOK: Why? <br>
GENTRY: All unauthorised personnel are to be debriefed by Starfleet
Intelligence. Direct orders from Admiral Bullock. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Listen, Ensign, we're late for a meeting with Starfleet
Command. The debriefing will have to wait. <br>
GENTRY: I'm sorry, Commander. <br>
(Gentry has pulled out his phaser.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Very well. <br>
(Gentry turns with Chakotay, and Tuvok neck-pinches him from behind.)<br>
TUVOK: When he regains consciousness, he'll no doubt want to report
this incident. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Paris, three to beam up. <br>

JANEWAY: Welcome aboard. <br>
GENTRY: Where am I? <br>
JANEWAY: On a starship. <br>
GENTRY: What starship? Why have you brought me here? I'll be reporting
this incident to the Admiral. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You can drop the charade. We know you're not human. <br>
JANEWAY: Who are you? <br>
GENTRY: Gentry, David. Rank, Ensign. Starfleet service number nine nine
beta three two seven eight. Planet of origin, Earth. <br>
JANEWAY: We're not interested in your knowledge of human culture. We're
not part of your re-creation. I'm Captain Janeway of the Federation
Starship Voyager. I'm from Earth. You're not. <br>
GENTRY: Gentry, David. Rank, Ensign. Starfleet service number nine nine
beta three two seven eight. <br>
JANEWAY: Doctor. <br>
GENTRY: What are you doing? <br>
EMH: I need a sample of your DNA. <br>
GENTRY: Why? <br>
JANEWAY: Since you won't tell us who you are, we have no choice but to
find out for ourselves. <br>
EMH: You won't be harmed. <br>
GENTRY: Gentry to Headquarters. Security alert! <br>
CHAKOTAY: We've disabled your comm. badge. <br>
(Gentry knocks the EMH's hand aside and leaps off the biobed.)<br>
GENTRY: No! Don't touch me. Disease! Humans! <br>

He's dead. </font></p>

is showing his photographs on a wall monitor.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Federation Council, Astrophysics, Starfleet Medical complex.
They even re-created the Officers' Club, the Quantum Café. <br>
JANEWAY: Computer, return to time index 4228. That's Boothby. <br>
SEVEN: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: The head groundskeeper at Starfleet Academy. When I was a
cadet, he used to give me fresh roses for my quarters. <br>
TUVOK: It's safe to assume this individual is not Boothby. <br>
JANEWAY: Whoever they are, they've gathered incredibly accurate
information about Starfleet headquarters. <br>
SEVEN: Perhaps they had access to a Federation database. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Or they've been to San Francisco. <br>
TUVOK: The habitat's population consists of humans, Vulcans, Bolian,
Ferengi. All Alpha Quadrant species. <br>
JANEWAY: What do we know about this artificial environment, Seven? <br>
SEVEN: I've used the tricorder data, holo-images and astrometric scans
to extrapolate a cross-section of the interior. I believe they used a
combination of holographic projection and particle synthesis. <br>
JANEWAY: Power source? <br>
SEVEN: There are thirteen thermionic generators beneath the city. I
can't identify the energy signatures. <br>
TUVOK: The habitat's heavily fortified. They are well prepared to
defend against an attack. <br>
EMH [OC]: Sickbay to Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Go ahead. <br>
EMH [OC]: I've completed my post-mortem analysis. You'd better get down
here. <br>
JANEWAY: On my way. If this is a training ground, it could mean they're
planning an invasion of the Federation. We should prepare for the
worst. See if you can find a way to penetrate their defences. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH: He
may look human, he may sound human, he may even smell human, but
there's no question, he's alien. <br>
JANEWAY: Was he genetically altered? <br>
EMH: On a highly sophisticated level. If it weren't for microcellular
scans I wouldn't be able to distinguish him from the genuine article.
I've managed to isolate the alien DNA. Fortunately, most of his cells
are still chemically active. If I use a cytokinetic injection I should
be able to trigger a genetic reversion. <br>
JANEWAY: Do it. <br>
(The reversion results in the massive form of Species 8472 flopping
over the tiny biobed.)<br>
EMH: Talk about a wolf in sheep's clothing. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Briefing
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Species 8472. The question is, why are they training to pose
as human beings? <br>
PARIS: Back in the twentieth century, the Soviets used to build
American towns to train their agents to infiltrate the United States.
Species 8472 could be doing the same thing. <br>
KIM: They're going to infiltrate the Alpha Quadrant. <br>
PARIS: Maybe they already have. <br>
TORRES: Tom's right. How else could they have gathered their
information about us? <br>
SEVEN: Perhaps they've acquired it from the Borg. <br>
JANEWAY: It doesn't matter how they got their data. We need to find out
what they intend to do with it. <br>
SEVEN: If our previous experience is any indication, they will try to
destroy Earth. <br>
TUVOK: A logical assumption. They did threaten to purge our galaxy of
all life. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok, keep working on a way to target their habitat's power
source. We're going to need nanoprobe warheads and plenty of them.
Seven, see to it. <br>
SEVEN: Yes, Captain. <br>
CHAKOTAY: In the meantime, I've got a date to keep. I made contact with
one of them, Commander Valerie Archer. Maybe I can capitalise on the
relationship. Get a better idea of what they're planning. <br>
JANEWAY: Tom, Harry, take him back in the Delta Flyer. Keep a constant
transporter lock on him. If Species 8472 attacks Earth, the Federation
won't have any defences against them, and I don't need to remind you
that we have no way to warn Starfleet Command. Voyager may be the last
defense against an all-out invasion of Earth. </font></p>

JANEWAY: I can recommend a nice Japanese replimat on the Embarcadero. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I was never very good with chopsticks. <br>
JANEWAY: Starfleet headquarters. Brings back memories, even if it is
just a re-creation. I remember my last visit there. I was given my
general orders for Voyager's first mission. Proceed to the Badlands and
find the Maquis. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The orders that brought us together. <br>
JANEWAY: What about you? When was the last time you were at
Headquarters? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Before today? March 3rd, 2368. The day I resigned my
commission. I can still remember the look on the Admiral's face. <br>
JANEWAY: Which one? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Nimembeh. <br>
JANEWAY: He taught at the Academy, didn't he? <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's right. <br>
JANEWAY: Interspecies Ethics, wasn't it? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tactical Analysis. <br>
JANEWAY: Of course. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Kathryn, you think I might be one of them. You're testing me.
<br>
JANEWAY: You and Tuvok were in the alien habitat for nearly three
hours. Anything could have happened down there. <br>
CHAKOTAY: True. Why don't you have Tuvok meet us in Sickbay. The Doctor
can perform a microcellular analysis. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok's already there. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You could have just asked me to report to Sickbay. <br>

tactful. </font></p>

impostor on board. </font></p>

Feisty little fellows. You've increased their cellular motility by over
two hundred percent. <br>
SEVEN: I thought it would be prudent to maximize their efficiency. <br>
EMH: Seven, the last time we used nanoprobes we sent 8472 scurrying
back to fluidic space. You can't get more efficient than that. <br>
SEVEN: The species is highly adaptive. It's been over a year since our
first encounter. They may have developed a defence against our
technology. <br>
EMH: There's one way to find out. We can test the nanoprobes on our
corpse. You'll find the body in morgue chamber three. Beam it to the
surgical bay. The creature's only been dead for a few hours, there
should still be plenty of cellular activity.&nbsp;</font></p>

EMH: Initiate a bio-scan, full spectrum. Don't worry. It's an autonomic
reflex. The creature still has residual bioelectric activity in its
nervous system. <br>
SEVEN: Something's wrong. The nanoprobes should have taken effect by
now. <br>
EMH: Hmm. <br>
SEVEN: What is it? <br>
EMH: The creature's nucleotides are still intact. It looks like your
concerns were warranted. We'll have to inform the Captain. We may have
to <br>

don't mind telling you, Seven, I'm still holding out for a diplomatic
solution. <br>
SEVEN: Improbable. Species 8472 will not respond to diplomacy. <br>
EMH: Funny. We used to say the same thing about the Borg. My point is,
anything's possible if you keep an open mind. Optimism, Seven. Try to
look on the bright side. <br>
SEVEN: It is difficult to be optimistic when we are preparing for
battle. <br>
EMH: Have you ever heard the phrase, the best defence is a good
offence? <br>
SEVEN: No. <br>
EMH: Throughout human history weapons of mass destruction were often
designed in the hopes that they'd never be used. <br>
SEVEN: And yet, in Earth's Third World War, nuclear weapons accounted
for six hundred million casualties. Were they looking on the bright
side? <br>

CHAKOTAY: I should have brought my holo-imager. You make a pretty
picture. <br>
(They go outside.)<br>
ARCHER: Mmm, feel that? Salinated oxygen molecules, stimulating the
epidermal and neural receptors. Non-fluidic space has its charms. <br>
CHAKOTAY: No argument there. <br>
ARCHER: Planet Earth. The simulation will be real soon enough. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How soon do you think? <br>
ARCHER: Weeks, days. As soon as they think we're ready. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Can I be honest with you? <br>
ARCHER: Please. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm starting to wonder if all this is worth the effort. <br>
ARCHER: What do you mean? <br>
CHAKOTAY: This simulation, our mission. Are we certain the humans pose
a threat? <br>
ARCHER: They were allies with the Borg. They invaded our realm. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That was one incident. That doesn't mean the entire
Federation is planning a war against us. <br>
ARCHER: We can't trust them. We have to prepare for the worst. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm not so sure. <br>
ARCHER: I think you've been human a little too long. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Before you know it, I'll be sending my resume to the real
Starfleet. <br>
ARCHER: Alien from distant galaxy seeks employment. References
available upon request. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Well, it's getting late. I'd better go. <br>
ARCHER: Already? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I have a tactical report to finish before morning. <br>
ARCHER: Aren't we forgetting something? I'm no expert at human dating
rituals, but I think it's customary to kiss good night. You've never
done this before. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Actually. <br>
ARCHER: Me, neither. Just think of it as part of our training. <br>
(She
backs him up against the door jamb and kisses him. Then Chakotay
reciprocates enthusiastically, and leaves.Archer goes to her desk and
takes out a scanner. She uses it <br>
on her hand where it had touched Chakotay's skin, and activates her
desk computer.)<br>
BOOTHBY [on monitor]: Report. <br>
ARCHER: I analysed his DNA. Your suspicions were correct. <br>
BOOTHBY [on monitor]: How much does he know? <br>
ARCHER: It's difficult to say. He'll have to be interrogated. <br>
BOOTHBY [on monitor]: Where is he? <br>
ARCHER: By now he should be in the main quad. I recommend we go to
daylight. He'll be easier to track. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Yes. Come in. <br>
SEVEN: The Borg modifications are complete. Nineteen standard photon
torpedoes and three class tens armed with high-yield warheads. <br>
JANEWAY: More. <br>
SEVEN: We ha've depleted our supply of nanoprobes. <br>
JANEWAY: Replicate a new supply. <br>
SEVEN: That is not possible. <br>
JANEWAY: Have the Doctor extract them from your bloodstream. Grow them
in a petrie dish. Whatever it takes. If we do engage 8472 I don't
intend to run out of firepower mid-battle. You of all people should
understand that. They killed, what, four million drones? Directive zero
one zero. Before engaging alien species in battle, any and all attempts
to make First Contact and achieve non-military resolution must be made.
In this case, we made first contact over a year ago and we barely got
out of it alive. It seems to me a battle is inevitable, maybe even war.
So why can't I get that directive out of my mind? <br>
SEVEN: This species intends to purge our galaxy of all life. It's time
you resisted your Starfleet philosophy.<br>

PARIS [on viewscreen]: Chakotay's in trouble. He tried to contact us
ten minutes ago, but his signal was cut off. <br>
KIM [on viewscreen] Some kind of forcefield went up around the habitat.
We can't get a lock on him.<br>
JANEWAY: Has your vessel been detected? <br>

take a shot at us yet. <br>

I thought you had a tactical report to finish. <br>
BOOTHBY: What'll you have, son? I'm a single malt man, myself. Aged two
hundred years. Been saving it for a special occasion, and I'd say this
is special enough. A toast. To Earth. Chakotay. Rank, Commander.
Starfleet service number forty seven alpha six one two. First officer,
USS Voyager. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Species 8472. Origin, fluidic space. <br>
BOOTHBY: Well, now that we've been formally introduced, how many ships?
Cat got your tongue? I asked you a question. How many vessels do you
have in the Delta Quadrant? <br>
CHAKOTAY: One. <br>
ARCHER: How did you find us? <br>
CHAKOTAY: We detected what looked like a Federation subspace
transmission. It took us weeks to track it here. <br>
BOOTHBY: We wanted this simulation to be accurate to the last detail.
We obviously went a little too far. Now that you know about our
re-creation, you've no doubt alerted the Federation. Your fleet will be
on its way. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You've got it wrong. We're not planning a war against you. <br>
ARCHER: Is that why you were here to spy on us, because you're curious?
<br>
BULLOCK: Sir, a starship is approaching. It's Voyager. <br>
BOOTHBY: Raise our shields. Stand by, all weapons. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain Janeway is not here to launch an attack. She's here
to find me. <br>
BOOTHBY: We've got the real McCoy here. We might as well take advantage
of it. Perform a genetic extraction. It may help us find a better way
to maintain these human forms. <br>

lost our shields. Mind if we join you? <br>
JANEWAY: You're clear to dock. Shuttlebay two. Any word from Chakotay? <br>
PARIS [OC]: I'm afraid not. <br>
JANEWAY: Bring us within range. Target their weapons array. <br>

JANEWAY: No, I don't want to risk shutting down their life support. If
we can end this without casualties, so much the better. <br>

we're violent, that we're planning to destroy your species, but none of
that's true. If you would take the time to speak to us directly, we
could prove it to you. There are no secrets except the secrets that
keep themselves. <br>
ARCHER: Shaw. <br>
CHAKOTAY: George Bernard Shaw. I saw a copy of his Collected Works on
your bookshelf. <br>
ARCHER: He had a complex mind, for a human. <br>

BOOTHBY [on viewscreen]: Don't get sassy with me, young lady. This
re-creation may be Starfleet but our weapons are far more
sophisticated. I can destroy your vessel with a single command. Run
along now. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm not going anywhere. Not until you return my First Officer
and give me a damn good explanation for what you're doing in our
galaxy. I've targeted your re-creation with Borg nanoprobes, and we're
willing to use them if you force us to. <br>
BOOTHBY [on viewscreen]: Don't try to rattle my cage. I'll disable your
tactical systems before you can<br>
JANEWAY: The last time our species engaged in battle, you suffered
heavy casualties. Are you willing to take that chance again? An armed
conflict isn't going to solve our problems. We could go on making
threats, spying on each other, risking a war between our species. Or we
could try a more direct approach. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
BOOTHBY: Targ manure! United Federation of Planets, tolerance for all
species, the Prime Directive. Targ manure, every word of it. <br>
TUVOK: Your metaphor is colourful, but inaccurate. <br>
BOOTHBY: Vulcan logic. Add that to the list. <br>
JANEWAY: Obviously, you've studied a Starfleet database. You must have
learned something about our history. We adhere to our directives. <br>
BULLOCK: High-minded ideals are one thing, but your actions tell a very
different story. You infiltrated our re-creation, captured and killed
one of our people. <br>
JANEWAY: I told you, he took his own life. <br>
BULLOCK: You created biological weapons to infect our species. You are
allies with the Borg. <br>
BOOTHBY: There's a drone sitting at this very table. Look at her, all
gussied up to look like a human being. <br>
SEVEN: I am no longer part of the Collective. <br>
BOOTHBY: Once a Borg, always a Borg. <br>
JANEWAY: Seven of Nine is a member of this crew. <br>
BULLOCK: The Borg are irrelevant. It's the humans that pose a threat. <br>
CHAKOTAY: They think the Federation is a hostile invasion force out to
destroy their species. <br>
JANEWAY: I see. So you're planning a pre-emptive strike against Earth. <br>
BOOTHBY: Maybe I am. <br>
JANEWAY: You realise I can't let that happen. <br>
BOOTHBY: Go ahead, fire your damn nanoprobes. Blow our re-creation to
high heavens. There are a dozen more scattered throughout the quadrant.
You'll never find them all. <br>
JANEWAY: What if I told you that Starfleet isn't planning an invasion?
That no one on Earth has even heard of you? <br>
BOOTHBY: I'd say you're lying. <br>
JANEWAY: Have another look at that Federation database of yours. You'll
see there's no mention of your realm. <br>
BULLOCK: Immaterial. Any information regarding our species has no doubt
been classified by Starfleet intelligence. <br>
JANEWAY: Good point. You know, we could keep this paranoid debate going
all day. You have no reason to trust us and we have no reason to trust
you. <br>
BOOTHBY: Hear, hear. I knew this reunion would be a fiasco. Admiral. <br>
JANEWAY: Seven, disarm the warheads Do it, <br>
SEVEN: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: Do it.<br>
(Seven goes to the wall monitor and complies.) <br>
BOOTHBY: What are you trying to prove, young lady? <br>
JANEWAY: One of us has to take our finger off the trigger. It might as
well be me. <br>
ARCHER: Their weapons are offline. <br>
BULLOCK: It's a trick. <br>
JANEWAY: Our defences are down. What will you do now? Blow Voyager to
high heavens, or do we keep talking? <br>
BOOTHBY: Humans. You've got a flair for the dramatic, I'll give you
that. You want to keep talking? Fine by me, but no more beating around
the bush. Now, what do you want from us? The truth, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Voyager is alone in the Delta Quadrant. We haven't been in
contact with Earth for over four years. <br>
BOOTHBY: Explain why you attacked our realm, hand in hand with the
Borg. <br>
JANEWAY: At the time, we didn't realise the Borg had started the war
against you. We forged a temporary alliance with them because we
thought you were the threat. <br>
SEVEN: Your galaxy will be purged. Sound familiar? <br>
BULLOCK: We were only trying to defend ourselves. <br>
TUVOK: If that's true, why are you still in our galaxy? Your conflict
with the Borg ended over a year ago. <br>
JANEWAY: Why re-create Starfleet, masquerade as humans? It looks to me
like you're the ones planning an invasion. The truth. <br>
BULLOCK: Don't answer her. She's manipulating us. <br>
ARCHER: If you won't answer, I will. <br>
BULLOCK: Commander.<br>
ARCHER: Our mission is to infiltrate your home world, to place
operatives in the highest levels of Starfleet, monitor your military
installations. It's a reconnaissance mission, nothing more. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We should listen to her, Captain. They're being driven by
fear just like we are. Unless everything you said on our date was just
part of an act. <br>
ARCHER: It wasn't. <br>
BULLOCK: Enough! We must not negotiate with these creatures. <br>
BOOTHBY: Sit down, Admiral. <br>
BULLOCK: Sir. <br>
BOOTHBY: I said sit down, or I'll knock you right on your human butt. <br>
BULLOCK: You've been seduced by them, both of you. <br>
ARCHER: I've had a chance to see through human eyes and I'm beginning
to wonder, are they really so violent? What if we're wrong? <br>
BULLOCK: We can't risk trusting them. <br>
ARCHER: You'd rather risk another war? <br>
BOOTHBY: Keep talking, son. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Archer's right. We've got to set aside our preconceptions
about each other. Granted, our species didn't meet under the best of
circumstances, but maybe we can make first contact again. Maybe this
time we'll get it right. <br>
BOOTHBY: You believe in this fellow? <br>
ARCHER: Yes. <br>
BOOTHBY: There would have to be a few ground rules. <br>
JANEWAY: Name them. <br>
BOOTHBY: First off, I want to take a look at that nanoprobe technology.
It scares the hell out of me. <br>
JANEWAY: All right, but I'll need some tactical information in return.

Good enough for me. </font></p>

SEVEN: It's difficult to have faith in an idea which may prove
tactically unsound. <br>
JANEWAY: Tactically unsound? Perhaps. It could also be the first step
toward peace. It's a risk I'm willing to take. Are you sure you won't
join us? It would be your first chance to see Earth. <br>
SEVEN: I prefer to remain aboard Voyager. If problems arise while
you're in the habitat<br>
JANEWAY: There won't be any problems. Nothing tactical, at any rate.
We're entering a stage of diplomacy where most of the problems will be
cultural. How do you shake hands with an 8472? We'll be fine. <br>
SEVEN: When you ordered me to disarm the warhead during the
negotiation, I anticipated an immediate attack. I believed they would
take advantage of your human weakness. I was wrong. If I had been in
your position, we would most likely be engaged in a battle with 8472 at
this moment. How did you know? <br>
