SEVEN: That wasn't my intention.<br>
NEELIX: No, of course not. I guess I'm just a little jumpy, especially
after what happened the last time.<br>
SEVEN: That's why I'm here. <br>
NEELIX: Oh? <br>
SEVEN: We'll be shutting down main power soon. The children's
regeneration cycle will be interrupted. They'll require supervision. <br>
NEELIX: Well, I'm happy to help. To tell you the truth, I'd be grateful
for the distraction. <br>
SEVEN: The procedure could take several hours. <br>
NEELIX: How much do they know about what's happening?<br>
SEVEN: Nothing. The children have overactive imaginations. I don't want
to alarm them unnecessarily. <br>
NEELIX:&nbsp;What if they start asking questions? I can't just lie to
them. <br>
SEVEN: You have considerable childcare experience. I'm sure you'll
manage. </font></p>

That's close enough. Let our momentum carry us in. <br>
PARIS: Cutting engines. <br>(A nebula is dead ahead.)<br>PARIS: There's a creepy image. Reminds me of something
out of Edgar Allan Poe. <br>
KIM: Looks like a vampire bat. You can make out the wings, even the
ears. What do you see, Tuvok? <br>
TUVOK: Two Starfleet officers with juvenile imaginations.<br>
PARIS: Come on, Tuvok. Haven't you ever looked up at the clouds and
seen an animal? <br>
TUVOK: I will never understand the human need to find imagery in
something as innocuous as a cloud.<br>
JANEWAY: Harry, are we ready? <br>
KIM: Yes, ma'am. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">ICHEB:
Why did they shut down main power? <br>
NEELIX: It's simply a precaution. We've entered a class J nebula and
the Captain wants to make sure that we don't attract any, er, residual
EM. radiation.<br>(Neelix puts a lantern on a table.)<br>
ICHEB: Our shields provide sufficient protection against nebula
discharge. <br>
NEELIX: Is that so? I'm afraid that gaseous anomalies were never really
my specialty. Come on, gather round. I've brought toys and stories and
games and I thought that later we might even have a little sing-along. <br>
ICHEB: I should go to Astrometrics. Seven may need my help. <br>
NEELIX: I'm afraid that Astrometrics is shut down, too. <br>
MEZOTI: If we're not analysing the nebula, why did we enter it?<br>
NEELIX: Oh, that is a long and dull story, and not nearly as interesting
as Flotter Meets the Invincible Invertebrates. <br>
MEZOTI: Is Voyager in danger? <br>
NEELIX: Mezoti, there's really no need to leap to those kinds of
conclusions. <br>
ICHEB: Maybe if you explained what's happening in more detail, we
wouldn't have to guess. <br>
MEZOTI: This has something to do with deck twelve, doesn't it? <br>
NEELIX: Well, what makes you say that? <br>
ICHEB: Deck twelve section forty two is off limits to everyone but
senior officers with a level six security clearance. <br>
MEZOTI: That's because it's haunted, isn't it?<br>
NEELIX: Who told you that? <br>
MEZOTI: Naomi. <br>
ICHEB: She was just trying to frighten you. <br>
NEELIX: I'll have to have a talk with that girl. <br>
AZAN: Is it true? <br>REBI: Does a ghost live there?<br>
NEELIX: You're really too old to believe in such silly things.<br>
MEZOTI: If it's not a ghost, what is it?<br>
ICHEB: We deserve an explanation. <br>
NEELIX: I don't think that Seven would be too happy if you all started
waking up with nightmares.<br>AZAN: Tell us. <br>REBI: Please?<br>
NEELIX: All right. Gather round. But I'm warning you, this is not a tale
for the faint of heart. <br>
MEZOTI: We're not faint of heart. <br>
ICHEB: Our cardiopulmonary systems are reinforced. <br>
MEZOTI: So don't leave anything out. <br>
NEELIX: All right. But remember, I warned you. It all began several
months ago, before you joined Voyager. We were exploring a dark nebula,
just gathering deuterium. We had no idea what was in store for us. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Mess
hall]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">NEELIX
[OC]: But when the turbulence started getting rough, we should have
seen that as an omen. <br>
NEELIX: How goes the particle collecting, Commander? <br>
TUVOK: We've got enough deuterium to power the warp engines for
another thousand light years. <br>
NEELIX: Excellent. <br>
TUVOK: Is something wrong?<br>
NEELIX: Now that you mention it, there is something that I feel
compelled to share with you in my capacity as morale officer. The crew
seem a little on edge. <br>
TUVOK: Oh? They don't appear particularly anxious to me. <br>
NEELIX: They're very good at hiding their fears. Starfleet training. I
was wondering how soon we might be leaving this nebula. Knowing could
help me assure them. <br>
TUVOK: It's difficult to say. The Bussard Collectors are running at
maximum, but it's a slow process. We could be here for several more
days. <br>(Shudder.)<br>
NEELIX: Days? <br>
TUVOK: Mister Neelix, are you certain it's not you who is on edge? <br>
NEELIX: You know me too well, Mister Vulcan. <br>
TUVOK: I can assure you, a J class nebula is no cause for alarm. <br>
NEELIX: I know it's illogical, but staring into this murky cloud for
hours on end can be a little unsettling. When I was a child, an immense
plasma drift passed through the Talaxian system. The stars and the
moons were blotted out for months. From horizon to horizon all you
could see was this enormous, menacing cloud. Ever since then I've found
it a little disturbing to be in nebulas. <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps the Captain might give you permission to install
curtains. <br>
NEELIX: That's an excellent idea. And I have just the right material. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Report.<br>
KIM: The nebula's beginning to destabilise. <br>
JANEWAY: Cause. <br>
KIM: I'm not sure. It could have something to do with the nadion
emissions being produced by the Bussard Collectors.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Cargo

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">ICHEB:
You're not remembering correctly. <br>
NEELIX: I beg your pardon?<br>
ICHEB: The Bussard Collectors don't produce nadion emissions. <br>
NEELIX: Well, the technical details don't matter. What's important is
that Voyager's presence was destabilising the nebula </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> NEELIX
[OC]: And the crew wasn't interested in taking any chances. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We've got eighty percent of the deuterium we wanted. Maybe we
shouldn't push our luck. <br>
JANEWAY: Agreed. Bridge to Engineering. <br>
TORRES [OC]: Go ahead. <br>
JANEWAY: We're suspending the dilithium intake. &nbsp;<br>(Oops, a slip of the tongue there from Kate.)<br>
TORRES [OC]: Acknowledged. <br>
JANEWAY: Tom, take us out. <br>
PARIS: Aye.<br>
NEELIX [OC]: But at that exact moment, in the fraction of a second
before Tom could engage the engines, zap! We were hit.

An EM discharge penetrated the hull. Deck seven, section ten. <br>
KIM: Increasing power to structural integrity. <br>
PARIS: We're clear. <br>
JANEWAY: Damage? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Power outages on three decks. Auxiliary subprocessors are
offline. No injuries reported. <br>
JANEWAY: Assign repair teams. Resume course. <br>
NEELIX [OC]: We'd taken some minor damage, but for the most part
everything was fine. Or so we thought.<br>(We are treated to a view of something sparkling attached to the hull.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">NEELIX:
What none of us knew was that a mysterious stowaway had come aboard
Voyager. <br>
MEZOTI: What kind of stowaway?<br>
ICHEB: It was obviously a space-dwelling lifeform. <br>
NEELIX: Yes, but we didn't know that, not at that point. <br>
MEZOTI: Was it non-corporeal? <br>
NEELIX: In a manner of speaking <br>
REBI: Hostile?<br>
NEELIX: Well, I'm getting to that.<br>
AZAN: Species 5973?<br>
NEELIX: Who are they?<br>
ICHEB: The Borg encountered them in galactic cluster eight. They're
multi-spectrum particle lifeforms. <br>
NEELIX: No, that's not what this was. <br>
MEZOTI: Maybe it was an inter-phasic species. <br>
NEELIX: We can either debate comparative xenobiology or I can continue
with the story. Now it's up to you. <br>
ICHEB: Continue the story. <br>
NEELIX: Somehow I thought you'd say that. Now, where was I? Oh, ah,
yes. Life aboard Voyager would have been more or less back to normal if
it weren't for a few strange malfunctions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Come in. <br>(Janeway gets herself a mug of drink from the replicator.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: I've got reports from repair teams. It looks like that EM
discharge did more damage than we thought. Transporter room one is out
of commission, half the sonic showers are offline, and we temporarily
lost artificial gravity on deck five. <br>
JANEWAY: Any injuries?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Ensign Mulchaey bumped his head on the ceiling. <br>
JANEWAY: Ouch. This is terrible. Computer, another cup of coffee,
black. <br>(This time the liquid materialises before the cup does.) <br>JANEWAY: You can add
replicators to your list. We're getting started on the wrong foot
today, my friend. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain?<br>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry. I was talking to Voyager. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's nothing to be embarrassed about. I used to have long
conversations with my Maquis ship. <br>
JANEWAY: Really? What did you two talk about?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Oh, I can't tell you that. Captain-starship
confidentiality. <br>
JANEWAY: Of course. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If the Doctor heard us he'd probably recommend counselling. <br>
JANEWAY: I won't tell if you won't. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Deal. <br>
JANEWAY: Commander, do you see that? <br>(A string of glowing objects outside.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: It's a meteorite cluster. I doubt it's anything to worry
about. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd tend to agree, if it weren't the same one we passed an
hour ago. </font></p>

heading back the way we came. <br>

NEELIX: The turbolift plunged eleven decks at high speed. The g forces
pinned Commander Chakotay to the ceiling. He knew that at any minute he
was going to come crashing down to the bottom of the turbolift and
there was nothing that he could do about it. But then the descent
stabilisers reactivated. </font></p>

when he showed up in Engineering that morning. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If I didn't know better I'd say this ship is trying to kill
me. Do you have any idea what's going on? <br>
TORRES: Well, I've traced the problem to a series of gel packs on deck
thirteen. It looks like they were burned out by an EM discharge from
the nebula. <br>
CHAKOTAY: And those gel-packs interface with all the affected systems. <br>
TORRES: I'm on my way to repair it right now. Feel like giving me a hand? <br>

SEVEN: You caused a power failure in Astrometrics. <br>
CELES: I did? How? <br>
SEVEN: That's what I'm attempting to find out. <br>
CELES: I don't see how I could have done anything. <br>

overloaded a series of EPS conduits while performing your diagnostic. <br>

CHAKOTAY: Could it have dissipated this quickly? <br>
TORRES: No, it moved. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Moved? <br>
TORRES: The discharge seems to be travelling through the bio-neural
circuitry, jumping from system to system. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Can you isolate it?<br>

[OC]: The crew was losing control of Voyager. People were scattered
throughout the ship with no idea what was happening. <br>(Celes hits Kim in the dark.)<br>
KIM: What did you do that for?<br>
CELES: Ensign, I'm so sorry! I, I thought, I thought you were a
Hirogen, or a Borg. <br>
KIM: And what gave you that idea? <br>
CELES: It's dark. Your shadow. <br>
KIM: Trust me, there are no aliens roaming the corridors. <br>
CELES: You mean we haven't been boarded? <br>
KIM: It's just a power failure. <br>
CELES: Isn't that what they sometimes do? Cut the power? <br>
KIM: What who sometimes does?<br>
CELES: Hostile aliens. They might be trying to infiltrate the ship. <br>
KIM: How long has it been since you've run into anyone else? <br>
CELES: I don't know, four or five hours. I, I tried Sickbay, but it was
deserted. Decks three and four are empty. I, I was on my way to the bridge. You're the first person I've seen. <br>
KIM: Well, there's no one on the bridge either. <br>
CELES: You see? Then maybe I was right. Maybe the reason we can't find
anyone is because they've all been assimilated. <br>
KIM: Slow down. There was an environmental failure on the bridge.
That's why it's been evacuated. I don't know what happened in Sickbay,
or on decks three and four, but I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable
explanation. Ah ha. No one's been assimilated. <br>
CELES: Then where are they? <br>
KIM: They've probably set up a temporary command post, most likely in
Engineering. That's where I'm going. <br>

NEELIX: You really shouldn't sneak up on people like that. I could have
shot you. <br>
TUVOK: Your restraint is commendable. <br>
NEELIX: Is there a problem with the air supply? <br>
TUVOK: An alien lifeform has seized control of Voyager's primary
systems. It's flooded numerous sections with poisonous gas. <br>
NEELIX: Are you saying that this alien lifeform is trying to kill us? <br>
TUVOK: Its intentions aren't clear. However, we should evacuate. <br>

Were you scared? <br>
NEELIX: Well, considering that Engineering was eight decks down and the
only way to get there was to crawl through pitch-black Jefferies tubes,
it's fair to say that I was never more frightened in my life. <br>
ICHEB: You shouldn't have allowed yourself to be afraid. <br>
NEELIX: Is that so. <br>
ICHEB: Fear distracts people from accomplishing their goals. <br>
NEELIX: Well, that's true, I suppose. On the other hand, fear can
sometimes be very healthy. <br>
MEZOTI: Explain. <br>
NEELIX: Well, it keeps you alert, keeps you from putting yourself in
unnecessary danger. <br>
MEZOTI: I was afraid once. <br>
ICHEB: You've been afraid many times. <br>
NEELIX: Icheb. Do you want to tell us about it? <br>
MEZOTI: It was when we were first disconnected from the hive mind,
before Seven rescued us. I couldn't hear anyone else's thoughts
anymore. I felt alone. <br>
NEELIX: I can understand why that was frightening. When you're scared,
it helps to have someone to talk to, doesn't it? <br>
MEZOTI: Yes. <br>
NEELIX: Of course, in my case, the only one person I had to talk to was
Commander Tuvok. </font></p>

[OC]: I tried passing the time with a little conversation but, as
you've probably noticed, he's not exactly what you'd call chatty. <br>
NEELIX: I'll bet Starfleet has specific procedures to deal with these
kinds of situations. You know, something like protocol one zero zero
five. In the event your starship is invaded by a hostile
electromagnetic lifeform. What do you suppose that, er, that protocol
might be, exactly? <br>
TUVOK: Rest assured, this crew is doing everything possible to regain
control of the ship. <br>
NEELIX: You're right. I'm just being silly. <br>
TUVOK: I concur. <br>
NEELIX: Of course, the crew of the Salvoxia probably thought they were
going to regain control of their ship, too. Did I ever tell you about
the Salvoxia? <br>
TUVOK: If I say yes, will it prevent you from telling the story? <br>
NEELIX: It was a Talaxian freighter. Horrible tragedy. Happened nearly
a century ago. After suffering a cascade failure, it began to lose life
support generators, one by one. Pretty soon, there wasn't enough air
left to sustain the entire crew so they began to draw lots. Can you
imagine? Draw the short straw and you suffocate? Anyway, the air
continued to diminish, and they kept drawing lots. The crew got smaller
and smaller as they waited for someone to rescue them, but no one ever
came. The Salvoxia drifted through space for the next eighty years, until
somebody finally found her. Makes me short of breath just thinking
about it. <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps you should occupy your mind with pleasant thoughts
before you hyperventilate. <br>

ICHEB: They may have been preserved by the vacuum of space. <br>
NEELIX: I shouldn't have told you that story. It's too gruesome. <br>
ICHEB: I wonder what the crew of the Salvoxia did for food after their
emergency rations were gone? <br>
MEZOTI: Maybe they ate each other. <br>

TUVOK: If I can access environmental controls, I may be able to vent the
