use a starboard service crawlway. <br>

LAFORGE: I'm all right, but I think we've got a new problem. One of the
energy conduits must've ruptured and ignited the polyduranide inside
the bulkhead. That's a plasma fire. <br>
(and it's green) <br>
CRUSHER: It's putting out a lot of radiation. We can't stay in here
very long. <br>
LAFORGE: We've got a bigger problem than that. The quaratum in these
containers is used in emergency thruster packs. It's normally pretty
stable stuff but when you expose quaratum to radiation, it has a way of
exploding.

TROI: Yes. How big is a quantum filament? <br>
O'BRIEN: It can be hundreds of metres long, but it has almost no mass,
which makes it very difficult to detect. <br>

O'BRIEN: No. that's a completely different phenomenon. <br>

engineering control system. <br>

RO: Engineering station's online, Counsellor. <br>
O'BRIEN: But that's a completely improper procedure. You can't just
dump that much raw energy into a bridge terminal without blowing <br>
RO: We're not going to get out of this by playing it safe. <br>
TROI: What is our engine status, Ensign? <br>
RO: We've got half impulse power available, but I'm getting some odd
readings from the warp drive. I'm reading a spike in the warp field
array. It looks like a containment deviation. <br>
O'BRIEN: Switch to primary bypass. <br>
RO: Nothing. Field strength's at forty percent and falling. We've got a
problem. The quantum resonance of the filament caused a polarity shift
in the antimatter containment field. <br>
O'BRIEN: When the filament hit us, the ship was momentarily charged, as
if it had come into contact with a live electrical wire. <br>
RO: That weakened the containment field surrounding the antimatter
pods. The field strength is at forty percent and it is still falling. <br>
O'BRIEN: If it falls to fifteen percent the field will collapse and
we'll have a containment breach. <br>

have to separate the ship now. <br>
TROI: I believe there are still people alive down there and I'm going
to give them every chance. Assuming they're alive, they'll be hoping
there's someone up here who can help them. So we'll help them. Chief,
divert the necessary power to Engineering. <br>
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. <br>
RO: I remind you, Counsellor, that power coupling could overheat at any
moment. By not separating the ship now, you may be responsible for all
our deaths. <br>
TROI: Thank you, Ensign. Proceed.

PATTERSON: What if that one doesn't open either? <br>
JAY GORDON: Then we'll never get out. <br>

look down. <br>
JAY GORDON: What's wrong? <br>
MARISSA: He's scared. <br>
PICARD: We're right with you, Patterson. You're not going to fall.
Everything will be all right if you just keep climbing.
What we need is a climbing song. Marissa, is there a song you sing at
school? <br>
MARISSA: The Laughing Vulcan and His Dog? <br>
PICARD: I'm afraid I don't know that one. I know. Frere Jacques. That's
a song I used to sing when I was at school. Patterson, do you know that
one? Good. It goes like this. Frere Jacques, Frere Jacques, dormez
vous? Dormez vous? <br>
ALL: Sonnez les matines, sonnez les matines, ding ding dong, ding ding
dong. <br>
PICARD: Very good. Now, keep singing. <br>
ALL: Frere Jacques, frere Jacques, dormez vous? Dormez vous? Sonnez les
matines, sonnez les matines. Ding ding dong, ding ding dong. Frere
Jacques, frere Jacques, dormez vous? Dormez vous? Sonnez les matines,
sonnez les matines. Ding ding dong, ding ding dong.

apart. Dilation has gone to seven centimetres since the onset of
labour. That did not take long. <br>
KEIKO: That's easy for you to say. <br>
WORF: You are doing very well. I am sure the child will arrive soon. <br>
KEIKO: Worf, has the baby turned? <br>
WORF: Turned? <br>
KEIKO: So the head is down. Doctor Crusher told me a few days ago that
it hadn't. She wasn't worried because I still had a month to go. <br>
WORF: I am not certain. Can't you tell? <br>
KEIKO: Worf, have you ever done this before?, delivered a baby? <br>
WORF: Yes. No. I have taken the Starfleet Emergency Medical Course. In
a computerised simulation, I assisted in the delivery of a human baby. <br>
KEIKO: Sometimes it doesn't go by the book, Worf. <br>
WORF: I am sure everything will be fine.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: Once the air is vented, the first thing
you'll feel is extreme pressure in your lungs. You have to resist the
temptation to exhale. Next, our hands and feet will get cold, then
numb, and some of the capillaries on exposed sections of the skin may
burst. <br>
LAFORGE: Sounds like fun. <br>
CRUSHER: We will have about fifteen seconds of useful consciousness,
then about ten seconds of extreme disorientation, then we pass out. <br>
LAFORGE: Okay. Once the air is evacuated, one of us is going to need to
get to that panel to repressurise the bay. <br>
(of course, the panel is on the far wall) <br>
LAFORGE: We're ready. Are you okay? <br>
(one touch of a button, up goes the outer door, some hyperventilating,
another command and out goes the air, the barrels and the green fire.
Geordi closes the doors and they set off across the bay, but he
collapses halfway. Beverly just makes it and air rushes back in)

We cannot run the risk of staying here any longer. <br>
O'BRIEN: We're in no danger until it drops below fifteen percent. We
can afford to wait and see if anyone in Engineering notices those
monitors. <br>
TROI: Have you made preparations to separate the Saucer section? <br>
RO: Yes, sir. We're in stand by mode for docking latches. <br>
O'BRIEN: Ensign there's a thermal inversion in the power coupling! <br>
RO: Quick, cross-connect to the transfer coil. That was close. <br>
TROI: What happened? <br>
RO: Exactly what I said might happen. The power coupling overheated and
the entire containment field almost collapsed.
O'Brien's fixed it temporarily, but this could happen again at any
moment, and next time we might not be able to stop it. You
can't let wishful thinking guide your decision, Counsellor. It's time
to leave. <br>
TROI: We will separate the ship when I decide that it's time, and not
before. Is that clear, Ensign? <br>
RO: Yes. Perfectly.

RIKER: There's no power on this entire deck, yet somehow these monitors
are working. <br>

RIKER: But why? Unless there's something they want us (pause) something
they need us to see. Wait a minute. Data, the containment field
strength is down to eighteen percent. Can you stabilise it? <br>

have to establish a new link. Locate the ODN conduit, sir. <br>

optical port and then connect the ODN conduit. <br>

Why has it not begun? <br>
KEIKO: I don't know. I don't think it's up to me. It happens when it
