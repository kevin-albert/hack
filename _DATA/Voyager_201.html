my father, the one whom the wind called Kolopak. Though I am far from
his bones, perhaps there is a spirit in these unnamed skies who will
find him and honour him with my song. A-koo-chee-moya. </font></p>

his name.<br>

Commander Chakotay of the Federation Starship Voyager. Why have you
fired on me? <br>
KAR [on monitor]: You are in Kazon-Ogla space, Federation.<br>

CHAKOTAY: I wasn't aware of that. I have no hostile intentions. Power
down your weapons and I'll leave.<br>
KAR [on monitor]: No one who violates Ogla space leaves.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Look, son, my starship is only a few light years away.<br>
KAR: I am not your son, Federation. I am your executioner.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Kazon vessel. Listen carefully. I do not want a
fight. Stand down or I'll be forced to return fire. <br>
(Bang! Chakotay looks the look and comes in behind the little craft.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Kazon vessel. I've established a direct weapons
lock on your engine core. This is my final warning. If you don't stand
down, I will destroy your ship. <br>

CHAKOTAY: All right, if that's the way you want to play it. <br>
(Chakotay fires phasers and destroys the Kazon engines, as promised.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Kazon vessel. Do you read me? Computer, are there
any life signs inside the Kazon vessel?<br>
COMPUTER: Affirmative. One life sign.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Kazon ship, your engine core is critical. You have less than
thirty seconds to evacuate. Do you read me? If you have an escape pod,
you must eject now. Computer, establish a transporter lock on the

NEELIX: Well, if you insist, but <br>

stand by your side through every danger this quadrant has to offer, as

CHAKOTAY: It's a human expression. You thank me for saving your life, I

soon as we get back to Voyager, we'll find a Kazon ship and hand you
over to them.<br>

CHAKOTAY: Computer, open a channel. Kazon vessel, I have a young man on
board you might know. He goes by the name of Kar. I'd say he's about
thirteen. I'd like to arrange for his transfer before I return to my
ship. Computer, confirm channel is open.<br>

KAR: Kill me. Please.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Why are you so eager for me to kill you?<br>
KAR: Because there are worse things than being killed by your enemy. <br>

CHAKOTAY: Look. If you check your long-range sensors, you'll find a big
ship out there. It's called Voyager, and by now it's on its way to find
me.<br>
HALIZ: Kar, I told Razik you weren't ready.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I have a fair idea why I'm here, but why are they doing this
to you?<br>
KAR: I was ready, Haliz, ready to kill or die. I felt the flames touch
my skin.<br>
HALIZ: Go back in, Kar.<br>
KAR: It was this fool, this Federation, who doesn't even have the
courage to kill his enemies. He pulled me out with that transporter
we've heard about. Like the Nistrim and the Relora before you, you come
into our space, showing off your uniforms and displaying the markings
of your Federation with no respect, as if you own this part of space.
But it belongs to us! I tried to kill him, Haliz. <br>
(Haliz knocks Kar down.) <br>
KAR: I want to see Razik. Tell Razik I demand to see him.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Who's Razik? You tell this Razik that Federation Commander
Chakotay demands to see him.<br>
KAR: What are you doing?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Razik is obviously your leader. I'm hoping if he's strong
enough to be in command, he's wise enough to listen to reason.<br>
(Kar shows Chakotay a piece of metal on display.) <br>
KAR: You see this? This is debris from a Nistrim frigate. The man you
are demanding to see destroyed it, killing more than one hundred in a
single shot. Before that, his name was only Ra. Now he is called Jal
Razik. And this tunic belonged to a Relora warrior. He was killed by
the bare hands of another Ogla, called only Hali. Now that man is
called Jal Haliz, one of our greatest fighters. And this bracelet
belonged to the man who killed my brother, my brother, Jal Kanal, who
earned his Ogla name by dying bravely in battle. But I, I will never
earn my name in life or in death, and I have you to thank for that. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Chakotay's shuttle.<br>
TUVOK: The signature of the radiation is not consistent with Federation
propulsion systems.<br>
PARIS: So what are we saying here? That someone blew up Chakotay's
shuttle and then took off?<br>

Hello, Kar. I never thought I would see you like this.<br>
KAR: It was not my fault. It was his technology! <br>
RAZIK: Don't make excuses, Kar. An Ogla has no room for excuses.<br>
KAR: No. No excuses.<br>
RAZIK: I forgive you. Know that in your heart.<br>
KAR: No. Please.<br>

RAZIK: You will eat at my right hand tonight. Why did you save him?
It's a very ineffective way of waging war.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm not at war with you.<br>
RAZIK: I wish I could say the same.<br>
CHAKOTAY: We're not familiar with this part of space. If I'd seen a map
identifying this as Kazon-Ogla territory, I wouldn't have been anywhere
near it.<br>
RAZIK: Unfortunately, our territorial claims change every day. Maps do
not serve us well. You did him a great disservice, you know.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I guess if he had killed me, my uniform would've made you all
a fine trophy.<br>
RAZIK: Your uniform may yet decorate our wall. You may not think you're
at war with us, Federation Commander Chakotay, but everything you are
is a threat to us. The Kazon fought long and hard for their
independence from uniforms like yours.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Uniforms maybe, but not like mine.<br>
RAZIK: Your uniforms, your laws, your technology. You are not welcome
here. Get him something to eat. The execution is tonight. </font></p>

look. You won't see any hate in my eyes. I'm a gentle man from a gentle
people who wish you no harm.<br>
RAZIK: That's enough!<br>
CHAKOTAY: I know you'd like them to hate me, Razik, but I want their
first impression of humans to be a good one.<br>
RAZIK: You've been brought here to learn what it means to be a Kazon
male. You all know Kar. You've learned to fight together, haven't you?
Kar was sent to kill this man to earn his Ogla name. But Kar failed,
and will not earn his name even in death. Who would be willing to kill
the human? <br>
(All the boys reach for the proffered weapon.) <br>
RAZIK: So much for first impressions, Federation. I'm proud of you.
Each will get your chance someday. But that's not what we're here for
today. We are here to learn the price of failure in battle. <br>
Razik holds the weapon out to Chakotay.) <br>
RAZIK: Take it.<br>
CHAKOTAY: What for?<br>
RAZIK: So that you can kill Kar, as you should have done in battle.<br>
CHAKOTAY: You want me to kill a child in front of other children? What
would it accomplish?<br>
RAZIK: It will teach these little boys an important lesson. And after
you do that, you'll be free to go. You may think I want your friend Kar
to die but you'd be wrong. I've seen too many Ogla die at the hands of
our enemies. That is why you must learn there are no second chances in
battle. That is why Kar must die.<br>
CHAKOTAY: If I refuse? <br>
(No answer. The weapon drops to the floor. Chakotay bends to pick it
up, attacks Razik and gets him on his knees with arms pinned behind his
back. He holds the weapon to the leader's head.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'll be needing my shuttle back.<br>
HALIZ: Do you really think you can escape us in that little vessel of
yours?<br>
CHAKOTAY: That's a chance I'm willing to take. What about you?<br>
RAZIK: Let the coward run. Prepare his shuttle.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Want to come? There doesn't seem to be much of a future for
you here.<br>
HALIZ: He'd rather die than run like a Calogan dog with you, Federation.<br>
(So Kar hits him and takes his gun.) <br>
KAR: If I stay here, I'll die without a name. And Razik taught me only
cowards die without a name.<br>
RAZIK: You won't find your name running after the Federation, Kar.<br>

EMH [on monitor]: I finished analysing the shuttle debris, and I found
no evidence of human remains.<br>

EMH [on monitor]: That is correct.<br>
JANEWAY: That's the first good news I've heard all day. Thank you,
Doctor.<br>
EMH [on monitor]: My pleasure. Now, would you mind having someone
transport this junk to the Cargo Bay? It's cluttering up my lab.<br>
JANEWAY: Of course, Doctor. All right, then. If Commander Chakotay
wasn't in the shuttle, where is he?<br>
TUVOK: From the dispersal pattern of the debris, we've been able to
extrapolate Chakotay's course prior to the explosion. It appears he was
heading for an M-class moon in this system.<br>
KIM: And we found a residual energy displacement within the debris
field that isn't consistent with the explosion itself.<br>
JANEWAY: You think he may have transported to that moon?<br>
TUVOK: We tried to scan the surface, but there is intense radiothermic
interference.<br>
JANEWAY: Radiothermic?<br>
TORRES: It appears to be coming from subterranean energy sources,
several carefully concealed weapons systems, phaser banks, force
fields, proton dischargers <br>
KES: Kazon. When they captured me, I saw how they concealed their
weaponry.<br>
NEELIX: I believe you call them booby traps.<br>
JANEWAY: Then this moon is some kind of Kazon fortification? <br>
KES: Or it may simply be a training site.<br>
NEELIX: For the Kazon, live ammunition is a very effective teaching
tool.<br>
JANEWAY: In the absence of evidence to the contrary, I choose to
believe Chakotay made it to that moon. Mister Kim, see if you can
determine the most probable location he would have beamed to.
Lieutenant, you and I will lead the away team.<br>

radiothermic interference, we will not be able to communicate with the

don't you? <br>
(Later, Chakotay is sleeping when Kar picks up the tricorder and turns
it off. Then he points the weapon at Chakotay, but he can't pull the
trigger and throws it away. He opens the tricorder again and sits
down.) </font></p>

is getting comfy in Chakotay's seat.) <br>
KIM: I've got a Kazon raider approaching at bearing two eight eight
mark nine.<br>
PARIS: On screen. Open a channel. I'm Lieutenant Tom Paris of the
Starship Voyager.<br>
RAZIK [on viewscreen]: Jal Razik, First Maje of the Kazon-Ogla. I will
speak to your captain. <br>
PARIS: I'm in command right now, so you can speak to me.<br>
RAZIK [on viewscreen]: You are trespassing in Ogla space. Why do you
orbit our moon?<br>
PARIS: Just stopped to make a few repairs. We'll be on our way in no
time.<br>
RAZIK [on viewscreen]: That is a lie. You are here looking for your
Commander Chakotay.<br>
PARIS: Now, how would you know about that?<br>
RAZIK [on viewscreen]: Quite simply. We killed him.<br>
PARIS: Under what circumstances?<br>
RAZIK [on viewscreen]: He kidnapped a young man. During his escape, it
became necessary to destroy his ship. No doubt you found the remains,
so I suggest you depart immediately.<br>
PARIS: Thanks for the advice.<br>
NEELIX: What a most unusual offer. A Kazon-Ogla Maje allowing a
trespasser to leave his space unharmed. What would the other Kazons say
about this new merciful attitude of the Ogla?<br>
RAZIK [on viewscreen]: Don't tempt me, Talaxian. I would just as soon
open fire.<br>
NEELIX: Would you?<br>
PARIS: Neelix.<br>
NEELIX: No, I don't think so. That would attract every rival Kazon sect
to your secret training base, wouldn't it? Now, I know your ships,
Maje. I even sold a few Plaxan sensors to the Ogla a few years back. I
have no doubt that you read the same life signs on that moon that we
have.<br>
HALIZ [on viewscreen]: Perhaps one of those life signs belongs to your
captain.<br>
RAZIK [on viewscreen]: If you've detected the extensive weaponry
deployed on the moon, know this. With one remote command, I can cause
that weaponry to self-destruct, destroying the surface of the moon and
everyone on it.<br>
NEELIX: Neither of us wants that, do we? Think of the cost of replacing
all those weapons. Awfully hard to come by in this region. And it would
make you so vulnerable to your enemies.<br>
PARIS: We'll leave as soon as we've retrieved our crewmen, all of them,
including Chakotay, if he's alive. And if one of your people is with
him, he'll be returned to you.<br>
(Transmission ends.) <br>
KIM: They're moving into a lower orbit. Looks like they're intending to
enter the atmosphere.<br>
PARIS: I need communication with the surface, B'Elanna, and soon.<br>
TORRES: I still haven't been able to get the dampening field working. I
can't even give you an estimate.<br>
KIM: Shall we take Voyager down?<br>
PARIS: I've already run a soil analysis. The surface won't support a
landing.<br>
TORRES: Then I guess the Captain's going to be greeted by some
unexpected visitors.<br>
NEELIX: At least we bought her some time. </font></p>

CHAKOTAY: Good morning. How did you sleep?<br>
KAR: Fine.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Really? You seemed a little restless to me.<br>
KAR: What do you mean?<br>
CHAKOTAY: All that skulking around, throwing things.<br>
KAR: You were awake?<br>
CHAKOTAY: You think I'm going to get much sleep around an Ogla warrior
who's threatened to kill me? Why didn't you go through with it?<br>
KAR: I am a coward.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't believe that. I don't believe you do either. I think
maybe you're beginning to realise I'm not your enemy, and only a fool
would kill a friend.<br>
KAR: If you are my friend, then you're my only one. What happens to me
now? Where do I go?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Would any other Kazon sect accept you?<br>
KAR: I would be a goven, an outcast. Each Kazon sect I meet would cut
one digit off, and send me away.<br>
CHAKOTAY: How many Kazon sects are there?<br>
KAR: It changes every day. Yesterday there were eighteen.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I guess you could come with us.<br>
KAR: To do what, dress in a uniform?<br>
CHAKOTAY: You wouldn't have to wear a uniform.<br>
KAR: And the closer you get to your home, the farther I would be from
mine. If only you had killed me. </font></p>

Captain, four life forms approaching. Forty metres. They appear to be
Kazon.<br>
RAZIK: Please, put your weapons away. We've come to help you.<br>
JANEWAY: Help us? With what?<br>
RAZIK: We made contact with your ship and learned of the plight of your
missing crewman. We've come to offer our assistance in finding him.<br>
JANEWAY: That's very kind of you.<br>
RAZIK: You're walking on very dangerous ground. There are concealed
weapons everywhere. Come. We will lead you through them.<br>

CHAKOTAY: Tell me about the other uniforms, the ones the Kazon fought.<br>
KAR: The Trabe. The Kazon shared their homeworld, if you can call it
sharing. They had everything, we had nothing, until we took it from
them in the revolt, twenty six years ago. <br>
(The tricorder beeps.) <br>
KAR: What is it?<br>
CHAKOTAY: People coming this way, humans and Kazon. <br>
KAR: What are we going to do? <br>
CHAKOTAY: There's only one way back to the Ogla for you, and that's if
you earn your name. So I guess that's what you'll have to do.<br>
KAR: But how?<br>
CHAKOTAY: You're going to have to kill me. </font></p>

weeks to track them. After this is over, we have to discuss an alliance.<br>
JANEWAY: I would welcome your friendship, Maje.<br>
KES: Captain Janeway, I'm reading elevated radiothermic levels here.<br>
RAZIK: The Ocampa female is correct. This is a particularly dangerous
place. We lose many trainees here. Perhaps you would prefer if we
proceeded alone. They can't be far now.<br>

HALIZ: This way. It's safer.<br>

seem the logical choice.<br>
RAZIK: I must apologise for my comrade. I believe he's trying to
mislead you.<br>
(Janeway, Tuvok, Kes and the security guard walk into a forcefield
bubble. They're trapped.)<br>
RAZIK: So, your technology is not always an ally. Sometimes it betrays
you. Pity. I'm afraid you would not score well in our training
exercises.<br>

KES: Captain, that panel is a micro-generator.<br>
JANEWAY: You're right. If we can get a narrow beam through the field,
we can disable it.<br>
