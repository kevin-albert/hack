phaser stuns. I'd guess several hits each. <br>
PICARD: Several? <br>
CRUSHER: It'll take us a while to bring them around, but they will
recover. We found a sample of blood. It's a rare iron-copper composite,
unique to one humanoid species. The Acamarians. <br>
PICARD: Acamarians? Then that would suggest the Gatherers. <br>
DATA: It is a likely hypothesis. The nomadic marauders who refer to
themselves as Gatherers have raided other outposts in neighbouring
sectors. <br>
RIKER: They've never come out this far before. <br>

PICARD: Their raids have made this sector unsafe. They've ransacked our
research facilities, our trade routes have been disrupted. <br>
MAROUK: The Gatherers are elusive. We've only managed to capture a
handful of them. But with the Starfleet's help <br>
PICARD: Hunting them down is not what I am proposing. <br>
MAROUK: Reconciliation with the Gatherers is impossible. It's been
tried. Every time we've offered amnesty, they've rejected it. <br>
TROI: When was the last attempt made? <br>
MAROUK: Eighteen years ago. <br>
PICARD: Eighteen years? <br>
MAROUK: For almost a century now, they've been parasites, moving from
star system to star system, living on what they could find or steal. <br>
PICARD: They're still your people. <br>
MAROUK: No. Captain, you have to understand our history. A hundred
years ago, before the Gatherers split off from our culture, we were a
savage, violent race. Clans battled clans. Bloody, vengeful feuds that
lasted for generations. But we overcame those ways, all except for the
Gatherers. <br>
TROI: After a century of wandering, they may be ready to come home. <br>
PICARD: Despite your progress, you are a divided society, and so it
will remain until the Gatherers return to Acamar. <br>
MAROUK: The attempt may be futile. <br>
PICARD: But there is so much to gain and there is so little to lose by
the effort. The problem affects us all. It cannot be ignored.

MAROUK: I am ready now, Captain. I need only bring aboard two more
servants. <br>
RIKER: I'll see to that, and to your accommodations. <br>
MAROUK: I have reason to believe there is a Gatherer encampment
somewhere in the Hromi Cluster. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data? <br>
DATA: The Federation has charted but not explored several class M
planets in that area. Any one of these planets might well serve as a

YUTA: Yes. I'll prepare all meals for the Sovereign and her servants. <br>
RIKER: We can provide you with a kitchen, but it won't really be
necessary. These food dispensers can synthesise anything that you may
been. I'll show you. Sovereign, may I offer you a drink? <br>

YUTA: I'm sure the Sovereign will wish to sample many of the cuisines
your ship has to offer, but there are
some Acamarian dishes that she will insist upon. <br>
RIKER: I will arrange for a technician to help programme your recipes
into the computer. Of course, I'll have to try some of them. What's
your specialty? <br>
YUTA: I have none. <br>
RIKER: Don't be modest. You can't tell me you haven't come up with a
few culinary delights. <br>

they steal. <br>

BRULL: Marouk? Here? <br>
RIKER: With an offer of amnesty. <br>

MAROUK: Full dispensation will be extended to all Gatherers who are
willing to return to Acamar Three. <br>
BRULL: You don't trust me, Marouk. <br>
MAROUK: Should I? <br>
(Marouk drinks from the goblet, then Yuta takes it to Brull)&nbsp;<br>
BRULL: But you expect me to trust you. Maybe you just poisoned it
yourself. Taste this, Temarek. <br>
(Temarek doesn't want to, so Brull pushes him down and pours some on
his face before taking a drink himself)<br>

live. <br>
BRULL: Am I supposed to believe that you care how we live? <br>
MAROUK: Yes. <br>
PICARD: Brull, she's here, isn't she? <br>
BRULL: Maybe you forced her to come, Picard. <br>
MAROUK: Nobody forces me anywhere, Brull. <br>
BRULL: What is there for us on Acamar Three? <br>
MAROUK: A life. A home. You can end your wanderings, your miserable
existence. <br>
BRULL: Do I look miserable to you? <br>
MAROUK: The clan wars are over, Brull. It is a past we're ashamed of.
It is why you had to leave. Now, it is time to come home. <br>
BRULL: I want to speak privately with Sovereign Marouk and Picard.
Everyone else, get out. <br>
(We follow the followers leaving their masters) <br>
RIKER: Any insights? <br>
TROI: Brull's ready to negotiate. He just wants privacy so that he
won't appear weak in front of the other Gatherers. <br>
YUTA: You are of the clan Lornak. <br>
VOLNOTH: (an old man) What of it? I've seen you before. <br>
YUTA: Yes. <br>
VOLNOTH: But it's impossible. <br>
YUTA: No. Look closer. I am Yuta of the clan Tralesta. <br>
(She touches his cheek and he falls backwards in agony) <br>
YUTA: I am the last of my line, but my clan will outlive yours. <br>
(Back at the camp fire) <br>
BRULL: Marouk's offer has value. <br>
PICARD: Commander. <br>
BRULL: But still, I don't know. <br>
PICARD: But you'll agree it is enough to present to your leader. <br>
BRULL: Chorgan is a better judge of these matters. I will take it to
him. You will hear from me in twenty days. <br>
PICARD: Brull, in twenty days, I hope to be very far away from here. <br>
MAROUK: With all due respect, Brull, I would like to make the offer to
Chorgan myself. <br>
PICARD: We'll gladly take you with us on the Enterprise. How many of
your men do you want to accompany you? <br>
BRULL: I'll come alone. If this is a trap. <br>
MAROUK: Oh, it isn't. <br>
BRULL: Mallon, you'll be in charge while I'm gone. If I'm not back in

BRULL: Volnoth was an old man. There's nothing to be done. <br>
RIKER: There's a chance that our doctors can do something. <br>
BRULL: You found him? <br>
TEMAREK: Yes. And there are no other members of the Lornak clan here,
so I claim his possessions. <br>
BRULL: Granted. <br>
(Temarek pulls off Volnoth's boots) <br>
MAROUK: Have you no respect for the dead? <br>
BRULL: What's there to respect about a corpse? <br>
(Crusher beams down. Riker pulls Temarek off) <br>
BRULL: Temarek, no. Calm down. <br>
CRUSHER: He's been dead too long. <br>
RIKER: How? <br>
CRUSHER: Cardiac arrest? <br>
RIKER: You don't sound convinced. <br>
CRUSHER: No, he died of a heart attack, all right, but I can't find the
cause. His cardiac muscle is strong and there's no sign of arterial
occlusion. </r></font></p>

clearly doesn't know what he's looking at) <br>
WESLEY: This is our present position. <br>
BRULL: Set a heading for three four three mark seven two. <br>
WESLEY: That's going to take us through the centre of an asteroid belt.
<br>
BRULL: What's the matter, kid? Can't you fly yourself around a couple

Loyalty to one's clan was absolute. The slightest injury to one member
demanded violent retaliation. <br>
PICARD: And these blood feuds could last for decades? <br>
MAROUK: The obsession with vengeance would be passed from generation to
generation. And with each act of retribution, the violence would
escalate. <br>
PICARD: It's not unlike much the history of my own planet. <br>

YUTA: Your pardon, Sovereign. May I be excused briefly? Commander Riker
requested that I prepare him an Acamarian dish. <br>

drink then heads over to Wesley's window seat) <br>

BRULL: What is this? <br>
WESLEY: Math. <br>
BRULL: I can see that, but what does it mean? <br>
WESLEY: This is the locally Euclidean metrisation of a k-fold
contravariant Riemannian tensor field. <br>

WESLEY: I didn't say that. <br>
BRULL: No problem. I have many friends that don't like me. But what do
you know about me? <br>
WESLEY: You're a thief. <br>
BRULL: I do it to survive, not because I enjoy it. We Gatherers value
our freedom. We do as we want and we answer to no creature. <br>
WESLEY: Then why are you helping Sovereign Marouk to change all that? <br>
BRULL: Maybe because I want something better for me, and for my
children. <br>
WESLEY: You have children? <br>
BRULL: Yeah, two sons. One's just about your age. He's not any good at
math. <br>

YUTA: I'm glad it pleases you, Commander. <br>
RIKER: I'm not your commander. My name is William. <br>
YUTA: I will call you William if you prefer. <br>
RIKER: I do. When you say Commander you say it like you say Sovereign
to Marouk. <br>
YUTA: As a servant. You're an excellent commander, but you'd make a
poor sovereign. <br>
RIKER: Why's that? Not that I disagree. <br>
YUTA: You're not comfortable with servants. <br>
RIKER: No, I prefer the company of equals. <br>
YUTA: So you treat me as an equal. <br>
RIKER: And you're not comfortable with that? <br>
YUTA: I'm not used to it. I've always been a servant. Not that I'm
complaining. The Sovereign treats me well. I have all that I could
want. <br>
RIKER: What about freedom? <br>
YUTA: I can never have that. <br>
RIKER: Because you're the property of the Sovereign? <br>
YUTA: No. I'm not her slave. I can leave whenever I wish. <br>
RIKER: But you have no place to go? <br>
YUTA: Just the opposite. My path is all too clear. <br>
RIKER: Yuta, you're an excellent chef, but you speak in riddles. <br>
YUTA: I've never been very good at conversation. <br>

CRUSHER: I'm thinking. <br>
RIKER: And? <br>
CRUSHER: The old Gatherer on the planet? I know what caused his heart
attack. The medical tricorder almost missed it, but there was a
microvirus in his body, blocking his autonomic nerve impulses. <br>
RIKER: And that stopped his heart? <br>
CRUSHER: But here's the really interesting part. This microvirus will
only attach itself to cells which contain a very specific DNA sequence.
<br>
RIKER: How specific? <br>
CRUSHER: Without knowing more about their genetic makeup, I can't be
sure. But my guess is, this virus would only kill one Acamarian in a
million. <br>
RIKER: Pretty single-minded bug. <br>
CRUSHER: Too single-minded. I can't believe it's a naturally occurring
virus. <br>

MAROUK: There are many levels of autonomy. Certainly your region would
have certain rights. <br>
CHORGAN: Yes, and those rights will be spelled out before I agree to
anything.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Commander, I'm afraid the only entry we have
on Volnoth in the Acamarian database is a birth record. <br>
RIKER: Probably one of the last of the Gatherers to be born on their
planet. <br>
CRUSHER: Commander? I've been digging through the medical database from
Acamar Three for hours, and I have found another victim of the same
microvirus that killed Volnoth. But only one. Fifty three years ago, a
Gatherer named Penthor-Mul. <br>
RIKER: Data? Anything in your file on Penthor-Mul? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. He was a member of the Lornak clan. He was captured
while leading a Gatherer raid on an Acamarian outpost. He died of a
heart attack before his trial ended. <br>
RIKER: Display Volnoth's birth record again. <br>
CRUSHER: Lornak. The same clan. <br>
RIKER: The only two recorded deaths by this microvirus both from the
same clan. What does that tell us, Doctor? <br>
CRUSHER: If these microbes were engineered for murder, I'd say somebody
could be going after a whole family. <br>
DATA: Commander, Chorgan, the present leader of the Gatherers, is also
from the Lornak
clan. <br>
RIKER: I want to know just how this clan was involved in the Acamarian
blood feuds, and I'd like to know any clue as to who their enemies
were. How could this virus have been transmitted, Doctor? <br>
CRUSHER: More ways than I can count. And it's perfectly safe to the
carrier as long as he doesn't have the same DNA patterns. <br>
RIKER: Tailor made for their enemies. <br>
DATA: Commander, eighty years ago the Lornaks massacred a rival clan,
the Tralestas. It ended a feud that had lasted for two hundred years. <br>
RIKER: Ended it? <br>
DATA: According to these records, there were no survivors. The
Tralestas were annihilated. <br>
CRUSHER: Something tells me they weren't all been wiped out. <br>
RIKER: There must be a missing link here. <br>
CRUSHER: Computer, any members of the Acamarian delegation from the
Tralesta clan? <br>
COMPUTER: Clan affiliation is not within provided records. <br>
DATA: Sir, I believe I have found a correlation between the two deaths.
Your missing link. That is Penthor-Mul being led from his trial. <br>
(a still image on the monitor) <br>
RIKER: I don't see the connection. <br>
DATA: Behind him and to the left, sir. <br>
RIKER: Computer, scan left and magnify. <br>
DATA: The computer can extrapolate and reconstruct the rest of the
face, sir. <br>
RIKER: Do it. <br>
(It is Yuta) <rb>
&nbsp;<br>
CRUSHER: But that photograph was taken over fifty years ago. <br>
RIKER: Fifty three years ago, and she hasn't aged a day.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MAROUK: Three seats on the ruling council? <br>
CHORGAN: If we're going to be subject to your laws, we want a part in
making it. <br>
MAROUK: Well I agree you're entitled to representation but not on the
ruling council. <br>
CHORGAN: Unacceptable. The real power is in the council. You're
shutting us off already. <br>
MAROUK: No! You're trying to take too much! No group has three seats on
the council. <br>
CHORGAN: I don't care what others have. <br>
MAROUK: You only care about what you can take. <br>
PICARD: Sovereign, if the situation were reversed, I'm sure you would
be demanding equal levels of representation. <br>
MAROUK: You're right, Captain. I apologise for my temper. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps a brief pause would be helpful. <br>
CHORGAN: I agree. Maybe a little touch of that brandy? <br>
MAROUK: Yuta. <br>
PICARD: You know, thank you, it is remarkable how very much alike the
two of you actually are. <br>
CHORGAN: That's ridiculous. <br>
MAROUK: Really, Captain. <br>
PICARD: No, I'm quite serious. You are both able negotiators, strong
leaders. <br>
BRULL: We don't obey weak leaders. <br>
CHORGAN: We have nothing in common at all. We haven't agreed to
anything. <br>
PICARD: You're wrong, Chorgan. We've agreed to have some brandy
together. <br>
(Yuta is serving Marouk when Riker beams in. He has to stun a Gatherer
guard) <br>
RIKER: Don't move! <br>
CHORGAN: A Federation trap! <br>
PICARD: Chorgan, I assure you, my First Officer has a good reason for
his actions. You do, Number One? <br>
RIKER: Yuta. Move away from Chorgan. Do it. <br>
YUTA: Why? <br>
RIKER: Because of a man you once knew named Penthar-Mul. <br>
CHORGAN: Penthar-Mul? How do you know Penthar-Mul? <br>
RIKER: Tell him, Yuta. <br>
YUTA: I don't understand. <br>
RIKER: You were with Penthar-Mul when he died. <br>
YUTA: It was fifty years ago. How could I? <br>
RIKER: I know, Yuta. Stop! Chorgan, keep perfectly still. Your life is
in danger. Step back, Yuta. <br>
YUTA: William, this is not your concern. <br>
RIKER: It is now. You're about to commit a murder. <br>
YUTA: It isn't murder. It's justice. <br>
CHORGAN: Who are you? <br>
YUTA: Yuta of the clan Tralesta. <br>
CHORGAN: There are no more Tralestas. <br>
YUTA: Five survived the last Lornak raid. But on that day, a century
ago, my life ended and my search began. I was the one chosen,
transformed. My cells were altered, my aging slowed, enough to finish
my task. <br>
MAROUK: You used me in order to get to the last few you couldn't reach.
<br>
YUTA: Yes, Sovereign. <br>
CHORGAN: You will never leave this ship alive. <br>
YUTA: You're the last. Once you're dead, what happens to me doesn't
matter. <br>
RIKER: The wars are over, Yuta. <br>
YUTA: You cannot understand. <br>
RIKER: You're right, I can't. Because I've seen the part of you that
regrets what you've become. Listen to me. You don't have to do this any
more. <br>
YUTA: I have no choice. <br>
RIKER: You do. <br>
YUTA: William, I. I'm sorry. <br>
RIKER: Stop. <br>
(The first shot is a mild stun. Yuta staggers, then reaches for Chorgan
again. The next shot is higher. Then Riker puts the phaser up to full
power) <br>
RIKER: Yuta, don't do this. <br>
(She moves towards Chorgan again, and Riker vapourises her) <br>
CHORGAN: Commander, I am in your debt.

PICARD: Oh, yes, thank you. New orders from Starfleet. The rendezvous.
(to waiter) Nothing, thank you. The rendezvous with the Goddard has
been postponed. <br>
RIKER: In the meantime? <br>
PICARD: Starbase three four three. We're to take on medical supplies
for the Alpha Leonis system. <br>
RIKER: Sounds pretty routine. <br>
PICARD: With the Gatherer truce in effect, it certainly should be. We
won't require a full ship's complement. I'm going to extend
shore leave on the starbase to anyone who wants it. <br>
RIKER: I'll pass that along to the crew, Captain. </font> </p>
