WORF: Forward tubes armed and ready, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Fire. <br>
WORF: A direct hit, sir. <br>
DATA: The asteroid has shattered. However, the core is still intact and
still on a collision course with Tessen Three. <br>
RIKER: Is it big enough to cause a threat? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. It is of sufficient size and density to cause
planetwide damage. <br>
PICARD: Time to impact. <br>
DATA: It will reach the upper atmosphere in forty four seconds and
impact on the planet eleven seconds later. <br>
RIKER: Ready torpedoes. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
DATA: Sir, the core is composed of nitrium and chrondite. It is
unlikely another photon torpedo will be of any effect. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, prepare a tractor beam. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
DATA: Thirty seconds to impact. <br>
WORF: Captain, I am unable to get a positive lock with the tractor
beam. There is magnetic field interference emanating from the core
materials. <br>
PICARD: Activate a deflector dish. If we project a particle beam, we
may be able to produce a disruptive nuclear effect within the core. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
DATA: Impact in seventeen seconds. <br>
WORF: Particle beam activated. The target has been destroyed, Captain. <br>
DATA: The remaining debris is of no threat to the planet, sir. <br>
PICARD: Well done, everyone . Ensign, put us back on course for the
Moselina system. Warp four as soon as we're clear of the debris field. <br>

clothing in the garment reprocessor. <br>
ALEXANDER: I was not! <br>
TROI: I sense a touch of hostility here, gentlemen. <br>
WORF: You were specifically told that. <br>
ALEXANDER: You told me that yesterday, not today! <br>
TROI: If I may suggest <br>
WORF: You know very well the same rules apply today that <br>
TROI: Please! Why not simply draw up a contract which clearly defines
the duties of each family member. <br>
ALEXANDER: You mean he tells me what he wants and I have to do it. <br>
TROI: No, I means you both agree to your responsibilities. And when
you've done the things that you've agreed to do, then you've earned the
privilege to doing the things that you want to do. When he's cleaned
his room, for instance, then perhaps he's earned a visit to the
holodeck to fight his alien monsters. <br>
WORF: You suggest bribery. <br>
TROI: I suggest working out an equitable system with the rules clearly
spelled out. For the child and the parent. You must make a list of your
responsibilities, too. What would you like your father to promise,
Alexander? <br>
ALEXANDER: No yelling. <br>
WORF: I do (softer) I do not yell. <br>
TROI: Well then you should have no trouble with that part. Why not go
back to your quarters and talk this thing over?
Decide on which points each of you wants in the contract. <br>
WORF: Very well. <br>
TROI: One day you'll learn to be glad your father cared enough about
you to insist on rules. It may be hard to imagine right now, but
eventually, most children come to appreciate their parents. <br>

friends and in the presence of my adored daughter. <br>
TROI: Mother, where did you, when did you meet this man? Who is he? I
mean, marriage? When did all this happen? <br>
LWAXANA: My poor, plodding, little Deanna, with her questions,
questions, questions. Wherever did you inherit such pedestrian genes?
What matters, my little one, is that your mother's happy. <br>
TROI: Mother, if you're happy, then I'm happy for you. I only asked who
he is, and where you met him. Those are not unusual questions. <br>
LWAXANA: He's such a wonderful man, and he has such good breeding, I
tell you, he's absolute perfection. <br>
TROI: Who is he? <br>
LWAXANA: He's Campio, Third Minister to the Conference Of Judges on the
planet Kostolain. Royalty, my little one, naturally. <br>
TROI: Naturally. I didn't know you'd ever been to Kostolain. Or was he
on some diplomatic mission to Betazed? <br>
LWAXANA: Well, neither, actually. You see, we haven't exactly met yet,
really. Oh, but the profiles we've exchanged. Why, they're in such
accord that you could weep, my little one. You would weep at the
harmony between us. <br>
TROI: Mother, don't you think it would be a good idea if you actually
met the man you're going to marry before committing to spend the rest
of
your life with him? <br>
LWAXANA: Deanna, I love you, but you do make everything sound like an
epitaph. <br>
(Worf and Alexander enter, still discussing the contract) <br>
ALEXANDER: I don't want to agree. <br>
WORF: But you have to agree. That is what an agreement is. Counsellor
Troi, excuse the intrusion, but we're having some difficulty
drawing up our contract. Mrs. Troi. <br>
ALEXANDER: He's not fair! <br>
WORF: The boy is unreasonable. <br>
LWAXANA: Well, of course he's unreasonable. He's a child. And such a
child. You know, making little boys reasonable only gives them pimples.
<br>
TROI: Alexander, this is my mother. <br>
LWAXANA: Alexander! What a wonderful name. You know, I once knew a
tall, handsome warrior named Alexander. Oh, he utterly adored me. We
went everywhere, simply everywhere. Have you been anywhere yet?
Contract? What contract? <br>
TROI: Between father and son. A fair and balanced way to achieve a
mutual sense of order. <br>
LWAXANA: Well, how ghastly for you. And you're doing this to your own
child, Mister Woof? <br>
TROI: Mother! <br>
WORF: It is Worf, Madam. <br>
LWAXANA: Contracts are usually between people who don't really trust
one another. A child who is trusted becomes worthy of that trust. <br>
TROI: Mother, will you kindly stay out of this? <br>
LWAXANA: And if he does not perform his contractual duties, I assume he
will be chastised? <br>
WORF: He will be sanctioned, yes. <br>
LWAXANA: And if you fail to perform your duties, what is the child
supposed to do about it? <br>
TROI: Mother, will you please <br>
WORF: I? Not perform my duty?! <br>
LWAXANA: Alexander. Now life's true gift is the capacity to enjoy
enjoyment. Now, have I arrived too late, or can you still smile?

her intended groom in thirty one hours. <br>
PICARD: I will not continue have that woman continuing to use this ship
for her convenience, simply because her daughter happens to be one of
my officers. <br>

She's not here yet. <br>
LWAXANA: Then you're early. That's very responsible of you. <br>
ALEXANDER: No, I just wanted to be out of my room before <br>
LWAXANA: Before what? Now, if we're to be real friends, we've got to
share only the truth. <br>
ALEXANDER: Why? <br>
LWAXANA: Well, for one thing, it's easier. When you tell the truth, you
never have to remember later what you lied about. But mostly, a true
friend is a person you can always tell the truth to without worrying
about it. <br>
ALEXANDER: I wanted to leave before my father got back. <br>

DATA: There is none present in the residue, either. <br>
LAFORGE: According to the mass spectrometer, the elements in the
residue have been broken down into simpler molecular structures. <br>
DATA: That would suggest the nitrium has been organically metabolised. <br>
LAFORGE: Maybe that's it, Data. If a living organism ingested the
nitrium. <br>
DATA: This residue would be the waste left behind. <br>
LAFORGE: If that's true, if something's eating away at the nitrium on
the ship. That means the dilithium chamber is vulnerable, as well as
the power transfer conduits. We'd better get to Engineering.

exactly, all right? <br>
ERKO: Minister, the woman should not be addressing you in the familiar.

how do I address him? <br>
TROI: Mother, we've come for Alexander. Please, forgive the intrusion. <br>
ERKO: Preferably he should be called by his ministerial title. <br>

be back. One hour, darling. I'll see you then. <br>

CAMPIO: We have business to deal with here. Leaving is simply not
acceptable. <br>
LWAXANA: Oh, well can't we just pretend it's acceptable? We'll be back.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: Once we saw that photonic trail moving
through the wall, we realised we must be dealing with a metal parasite
of some kind. <br>
DATA: We believe the parasites came through the ship's hull after we
destroyed the asteroid near Tessen Three. <br>
PICARD: Are they attacking anything other than nitrium alloy? <br>
LAFORGE: No, sir, not that we can tell. But we've got nitrium
everywhere. The computers, the life support, the ventilation, the
engines, even the dilithium chamber. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, the asteroid we destroyed. That was rich in
nitrium. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: And that asteroid came from the Pelloris Field. If the rest of
that field is rich in nitrium, it would make a natural feeding ground. <br>
LAFORGE: We should think about going back there. The parasites could
possibly be lured back to the asteroids for a meal that's more
appealing than we are. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, how long to the field? <br>
DATA: At warp nine, five hours twenty minutes, sir. <br>
PICARD: Picard to the Bridge <br>
RIKER [OC]: Riker here, sir. <br>
PICARD: Set a course for the Pelloris asteroid field, warp nine. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Aye, sir. <br>
DATA: Captain, with our sensors unable to detect the parasites and
given the speed with which they appear to be moving through the ship <br>
PICARD: We may not have five hours and twenty minutes. I'm aware of
that. How can we slow them down? <br>
DATA: In several cases, an exanogen gas barrier has been known to slow
the progress of metal parasites. <br>
PICARD: They don't like cold, eh? Make it so. <br>
LAFORGE: The problem is finding them. As soon as we spot an energy
fluctuation, they've already consumed all the nitrium and have moved
on. <br>
(the lights flicker) <br>
LAFORGE: Primary power systems are going down. I've rerouted to the
secondary generators. <br>

suggestions on how we could encourage the parasites to leave the ship
once we reach the Pelloris Field? <br>
DATA: If we reconfigure a particle beam with a high concentration of
nitrium, and project it toward one of the asteroids. <br>
PICARD: Then they would follow the beam like a trail of breadcrumbs.
Very well. <br>
