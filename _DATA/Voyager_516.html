rather give up warp travel than accept help from strangers.

I thought we agreed Central Control would be off limits. <br>(He is a middle-aged male. Janeway has been getting her hands dirty, and wipes them on a cloth.)<br>
JANEWAY: We did, but I need to access your warp assembly. <br>
JIPPEQ: That technology's classified. <br>
JANEWAY: We have to reconfigure the assembly if we're going to finish
this job. <br>
JIPPEQ: Then consider it finished. <br>
JANEWAY: We've come this far. <br>
JIPPEQ: You've turned our ship upside down for two weeks, and I've yet to
see any results.<br>
JANEWAY: You might check the antimatter injectors. <br>
JIPPEQ: Back online. <br>
JANEWAY: All you need now is a jolt of antimatter from Voyager's
engines and you'll be back in business, but I need access to your warp
assembly. You know, I can understand why you're distrustful of other
species. Frankly, we've had a rough time in the Delta Quadrant
ourselves. But our two species have made remarkable progress working
together to repair your engines. We've come a long way since you
ignored our opening hails. Let's not throw all that away. <br>
JIPPEQ: I'll admit we do share some things in common. <br>
JANEWAY: We're both on long journeys, looking for allies. In many ways,
we're like cousins. <br>
JIPPEQ: Cousins? <br>
JANEWAY: Well, distant cousins. Think about it. Four hundred years ago
you started out the same way we did, a single starship, a small crew,
facing the unknown. And now, centuries later, you've grown into a
generational ship with a history and culture all your own. When I look
at your vessel, I can't help but wonder if I'm seeing Voyager's future.
Our journey could easily last several generations. So, what do you say,
cousin? <br>
JIPPEQ: You can access the warp assembly from here. <br>
JANEWAY: Thank you. <br>(Torres and Paris enter. He is carrying a box.)<br>JANEWAY: Status? <br>

TAL: Come back to bed. <br>
KIM: I can't sleep. <br>
TAL: Cuddle. <br>
KIM: I can't cuddle. <br>
TAL: I told you we're not going to get caught. If someone had seen us,
they would've reported it by now. <br>
KIM: I'm violating about half a dozen regulations by just being in this
room. And what we did earlier? I don't know if Starfleet even has a
regulation for that. <br>
TAL: What are you saying? Making love is a crime in your culture? <br>
KIM: Yes! No. What I'm saying is, it's a breach of protocol. <br>
TAL: How romantic. <br>
KIM: The Captain instructed all away teams. No personal interaction
with the Varro crew. I violated a direct order. <br>
TAL: Come back to bed. That's an order. <br>(Kim sits down next to her.)<br>TAL: Are all humans so jumpy? <br>
KIM: No, only me. <br>(The ship shakes slightly.) <br>KIM: The warp engines. They've started the plasma transfer.
We've got to get down there. We're late. What are you waiting for? <br>
TAL: To see what you look like in my uniform. <br>
KIM: You don't understand. If I'm not at my post. <br>

JANEWAY: B'Elanna? <br>
TORRES: I'm reading microfractures all over the hull. <br>
JIPPEQ: Why couldn't we detect that before? <br>
JANEWAY: Good question. We'll have to check the hulls in each of your

TUVOK: Stuff? <br>
PARIS: Their environmental control system, for instance. It's completely
regenerative. Zero waste. <br>
TUVOK: Impressive. <br>
PARIS: It can be programmed to create almost any habitat. If you wanted
to, you could recreate Vulcan in your quarters with that system. <br>
TUVOK: Why would I want to? <br>
PARIS: A little taste of home in the Delta Quadrant? Think about it.
Springtime on the shores of Lake Yaron. <br>
TUVOK: I require a desk and a bed. Nothing more. <br>

thousand assimilated species. <br>

intimate relationship with an alien species. <br>
JANEWAY: Bravo. Unfortunately, your recitation comes a little late.
According to the Doctor, your condition isn't life-threatening. There's
no reason to confine you to Sickbay. Nut I do agree with his
recommendation to run full bioscans on both you and Tal. And her people
need to be told so they can evaluate any bio-threat you might have
introduced into their population. We're trying to help these people,
Ensign, earn their trust. I was even hoping they might return the
favour, share their technology, their insights into long-term space
travel. But your little escapade put that in jeopardy. <br>

fling. I've really gotten to know Tal, and I've developed true feelings
for her. <br>

JANEWAY: What are you implying? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Are you angry because Harry disobeyed orders, or because he
let you down. <br>
JANEWAY: I set the same standards for all my officers. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If I object to one of your decisions you'll hear me out, even
insist I speak up. <br>
JANEWAY: You're my First Officer, he's an Ensign. He hasn't earned the
right to question my orders, whatever his personal views. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I see. <br>
TORRES [OC]: Engineering to the Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Yes? <br>
TORRES [OC]: We've found something. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JIPPEQ:
Do your officers make a habit of seducing the species they encounter? <br>
JANEWAY: Certainly not. But it's my understanding this relationship was
consensual. <br>
JIPPEQ: I find that difficult to believe. We don't share your cavalier
attitude toward intimacy. <br>
JANEWAY: Our attitude is anything but cavalier. Ensign Kim has already
been reprimanded. What about Tal? What happens to her? <br>
JIPPEQ: In our society, mating is taken very seriously. When two people
chose each other the bonding is permanent. They become biochemically
linked. Separation is rare. It induces illness, sometimes fatal. What's
to become of Tal when your Ensign flies off in search of his next
conquest? </font></p>

Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: You found something? <br>
TORRES: We've detected microfractures in one of Voyager's docking
ports. <br>
JIPPEQ: Microfractures? That's the same problem we've been having. <br>
JANEWAY: A coincidence? <br>
TORRES: I had suspicions that it wasn't. Seven confirmed them. <br>
SEVEN: Observe. Silicon-based parasites which feed on duranium alloys.
Apparently they began replicating on the Varro ship's hull several
months ago, and then migrated to Voyager. <br>
TORRES: We analysed them and found artificial gene sequences. The
parasites are synthetic. <br>
SEVEN: They may have been created by someone aboard your vessel. <br>
JIPPEQ: Sabotage? I don't believe it. <br>
SEVEN: Perhaps not everyone is content to be in your Collective.

Where are we? <br>
KIM: A shuttlecraft. <br>
TAL: A shuttlecraft? <br>
KIM: A short range vessel. We use it for away mission. <br>
TAL: We can go anywhere we want? <br>
KIM: Anywhere. For a while, anyway. I'm not due back on Voyager until
nineteen hundred hours. They think I'm still out repairing a hull
fracture. I finished early. <br>
TAL: You're a fugitive now. How many protocols did you break this time?
Let's see. Unauthorised use of a shuttlecraft, kidnapping. <br>
KIM: Direct violation of the Captain's orders. I must be crazy. <br>
TAL: I like you crazy. Navigation? <br>
KIM: Careful, that's the weapons array. You know you almost vaporised
your living quarters. <br>
TAL: Well, they could use a good cleaning. Let's go somewhere. <br>
KIM: Where? <br>
TAL: There's a nebula about three hundred thousand kilometres from
here. I've been watching it on the sensors for the past few days. Oh, I
would love to see it with my own eyes. <br>
KIM: Have a seat. <br>(Off they fly.)<br>TAL:
Look at this. A subspace vacuole near the centre of the cloud. It must
act as a gravitational anchor. There's so much data here it'll take
weeks to analyse. Do you have a storage device? We need to download
these reading. What?<br>
KIM: I've just never seen anyone so excited about a class three nebula
before. <br>
TAL: Maybe you've been taking them for granted. <br>
KIM: Maybe I have. Don't stop. You're beautiful when you're scanning. <br>
TAL: Is that what you say to every girl you take for a ride? I bet
you've left a trail of broken hearts across the Delta Quadrant. <br>
KIM: Actually <br>(Beep!)<br>
TAL: Problem? <br>
KIM: Stray radiation from the nebula. I thought it was the proximity
alarm. <br>
TAL: You said we had a couple of hours. No one's going to come looking
for us. <br>
KIM: Oh, you don't know Commander Tuvok. If he sees one electron out of
place he calls for red alert. Here we are alone and all I can think
about is duty and orders. <br>
TAL: Those things are important. I think about them, too. But sometimes
you need to follow a different kind of protocol. If you believe in
something strongly enough, you can't ignore it, even if it means
breaking a few rules. <br>
KIM: That's why I took this shuttle. But every time I break a rule, I
feel like my skull is going to decompress. I'm like some kind of Borg
drone. Programmed. Except I was designed to be the perfect Starfleet
officer. Top of his class, Captain of the Velocity team. Interstellar
honours. First field assignment, bridge officer on a starship. Every
cadet's dream come true. <br>
TAL: You're not a programme. In fact, I envy your freedom. I mean, your
crew's mission to seek out life. What could be more liberating? You
explore the unknown. Don't be afraid to explore what's happening
between us. <br>(That is the proximity alarm this time.)<br>
KIM: Oh no, the Delta Flyer. <br>
TAL: Commander Tuvok? <br>
KIM: We're being hailed. <br>
TAL: Well, you'd better answer them before they open fire. <br>
KIM: Kim here.&nbsp;<br>
TUVOK [OC]: Ensign, you are in direct violation of the Captain's
orders. Return to Voyager immediately, and bring Derran Tal with you. <br>
KIM: Yes sir, but why bring Tal? <br>
TUVOK [OC]: She's wanted by the Varro authorities regarding an act of
sabotage.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JIPPEQ:
There's no point in lying. We found a schematic for the parasite on
your personal database. You realise this could destroy our ship, our
home? <br>
TAL: To some of us it's more like a prison. <br>
JIPPEQ: So you've resorted to sabotage, no doubt involving him. <br>
TUVOK: Mister Kim's complicity remains to be proven. <br>
TAL: He had nothing to do with our movement. <br>
JIPPEQ: Movement? <br>
TAL: Tell them. <br>
JIPPEQ: It's none of their concern. <br>
JANEWAY: If you want our help, you'll need to explain. <br>
JIPPEQ: She's referring to a small group of dissidents. <br>
TAL: It's not a small group. There are hundreds of us. <br>
JANEWAY: What are you trying to achieve? <br>
TAL: Our freedom. The right to live where we choose, to go where we
choose. <br>
TUVOK: How will you accomplish that if your vessel is destroyed? <br>
TAL: We're not trying to destroy it. We're trying to dismantle it. The
parasites weren't placed randomly. They're targeting the linkages
between segments. Each segment will become its own ship. People can
decide whether to go or stay. <br>
JIPPEQ: You're destroying the work of every generation that came before
you. Our ship isn't just a collection of modules, it's an expression of
unity, tradition. For the sake of our history we must respect the
rights of <br>
TAL: Of the majority. <br>
JIPPEQ: Yes. <br>
TAL: What about the rights of the minority? <br>
JANEWAY: Tal, if those segments come apart there could be decompressive
explosions, most likely casualties. Is that what you want? You know
more about the parasites than we do. You could help us. <br>
JIPPEQ: Captain, she's a criminal. <br>
JANEWAY: And maybe your only chance of stopping a catastrophe. Set up a
datalink with Voyager. We'll do what we can from our end. <br>
KIM: Tal? <br>
TAL: I'll help you slow down the parasites so you can evacuate the
segments in danger. Nothing more. <br>
JIPPEQ: Let's get started. <br>(Jippeq and Tal leave. Janeway nods to Tuvok and he leaves.)<br>
KIM: Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Stow it, Ensign. Right now the only thing standing between you
and the Brig is this report. The Doctor's bioscans confirm that you and
Tal have developed some sort of biochemical bond. Clearly it's affected
your behaviour, so I have to assume that's why you disobeyed my orders.
Report to Sickbay. You'll be confined there until this is over.

You've got thirty seconds before I have Tuvok drag you to Sickbay. <br>
KIM: Captain, I am not sick. I didn't disobey your orders because I'm
under some alien influence. I disobeyed your orders because Tal and I
are in love, and it's not right for you to keep us apart! <br>
JANEWAY: Listen to yourself. You don't sound anything like the Harry
Kim I know. <br>
KIM: Good. I have served on this ship for five years and said, yes,
ma'am to every one of your orders. But not this time. <br>
JANEWAY: You're willing to risk your rank, your career, over this? <br>
KIM: Have you ever been in love, Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: Your point? <br>
KIM: Did your skin ever flush when you were near another person? Did
your stomach ever feel like someone hollowed it out with a knife when
you were apart? Did your throat ever swell when you realised it was
over? Seven of Nine, Seven of Nine told me love's like a disease. Well,
maybe it is. Pheromones, endorphins, chemicals in our blood, changing
our responses, physical discomfort, but any way you look at it, it's
still love. <br>
JANEWAY: For the sake of argument, let's say you're right. Your
feelings for Tal are no different than mine for what, the man I was
engaged to marry? Well, I lost him and you're going to lose Tal. You
know that. What the Doctor is offering you is a way to ease the pain. <br>
KIM: That man you were going to marry. If you could have just taken a
hypospray to make yourself stop loving him, so that it didn't hurt so
much when you were away from him, would you have done that? <br>(Whumph!)<br>

or two. They could finish the evacuation. <br>

reacted to your relationship with Tal. <br>

been the same if it had been, say, Tom Paris instead of you. Oh don't
get me wrong, I still would have been angry and disappointed, but I
wouldn't have been surprised. <br>
KIM: Because Ensign Kim doesn't break the rules. <br>
JANEWAY: The truth is, Harry, I think about you differently than the
rest of the crew. Which isn't to suggest that I don't care deeply about
each of them. You came to me fresh out of the Academy, wide-eyed with
excitement about your first deep space assignment. From that first day,
I've always felt more protective of you than the others. <br>

kept me occupied. <br>
SEVEN: You are attempting to distract yourself from your emotional
damage? <br>
KIM: I wish I could say it was working. <br>
SEVEN: The treatment to relieve your condition was available and yet
you refused. <br>
KIM: I've got a disease, but I'm willing to live with the symptoms.
Doesn't make much sense, does it? <br>
SEVEN: I assumed that romantic love was a human weakness, but clearly
it can also be a source of strength. Perhaps my analogy was flawed.
Love is not a disease. Get well soon. </font> </p>
