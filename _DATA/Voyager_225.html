is pouring an orange drink.) <br>
NEELIX: Anthraxic citrus peel, orange juice with just a hint of papalla
seed extract. An experimental blend. <br>
TUVOK: The success rate of your culinary experiments has not been high.
<br>
NEELIX: Ensign Golwat tried some yesterday, and she thought it was
delicious. In fact, she had a second glass, and she never has seconds. <br>
TUVOK: Ensign Golwat is Bolian. Her tongue has a cartilaginous lining.
It would protect her against even the most corrosive acid. <br>
NEELIX: All I ask is that you try it, Mister Vulcan. <br>

sniffs and sips.) <br>
TUVOK: Impressive. <br>
NEELIX: Ah! I'll start squeezing that second glass. Breakfast is coming
right up. Porakan eggs. <br>
TUVOK: Porakan? <br>
NEELIX: The most flavourful eggs in the sector. Scrambled with a little
dill weed, a touch of rengazo, a galactic favourite. Now, these eggs
were not easy to prepare. After we picked them up on Porakas Four, I
had to sterilise them in a cryostatic chamber for three days. Then each
and every one had to be parboiled <br>
TUVOK: Mister Neelix, I would prefer not to hear the life history of my
breakfast. <br>
NEELIX: On Talax it's a tradition to share the history of a meal before
you begin eating. It's a way of enhancing the culinary experience. My
mother was brilliant. She could make every course, every garnish come
alive by making it a character in a story. My favourite was the one
about the crustacean who <br>
(Flames surge up around the egg pan, setting the contents alight.
Neelix quickly smothers it with a lid.) <br>
TUVOK: What happened? <br>
NEELIX: Er, some sort of power overload. I'm afraid it decimated your
breakfast. This is what my mother would call a tragic ending. <br>
TUVOK: Engineering has been making adjustments to the plasma conduits
to accommodate a new energy source. It may have created a thermal surge
in the galley systems. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Janeway to Tuvok. Please report to the bridge. Mister
Neelix, I'd like you to join us as well. <br>
NEELIX: Aye, Captain.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 50126.4. We have detected a
gaseous anomaly that contains sirillium, a highly combustible and
versatile energy source. We've altered course to investigate.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEELIX: Sirillium? <br>
JANEWAY: Yes, and possibly large amounts of it. If so, we're going to
need to stockpile as much as we can. I'd like to convert storage bay
three into a containment chamber. <br>
NEELIX: My pantry. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry, Neelix. You're going to have to make other
arrangements. <br>
NEELIX: Of course, Captain. You know, if I injected sirillium into my
thermal array, it might improve cooking time. <br>
TORRES: Yes, and blow up half your kitchen in the process. Sirillium is
far more useful as a warp plasma catalyst. <br>
TUVOK: The gas can also be used to boost deflector shield efficiency. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The vultures are circling. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, there's certainly no shortage of good ideas. Have all
department heads submit proposals for sirillium usage. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. <br>
TUVOK: The anomaly is within visual range. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. <br>
(This one is blue, not purple.) <br>
JANEWAY: Analysis, Mister Kim. <br>
KIM: It's a class seventeen nebula. I'm detecting standard amounts of
hydrogen, and helium, and seven thousand parts per million of
sirillium. <br>
TORRES: Captain, I recommend we use the Bussard collectors to gather
the sirillium. They'll cut through that nebula like ice cream scoops. <br>
PARIS: I'm picking up a lot of plasmatic turbulence in there. It might
be a bumpy ride. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok, can you modify the shields to compensate? <br>
(Tuvok's breath is shallow and his hands are twitching.) <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Are you all right, Lieutenant? <br>
TUVOK: I don't know. I'm experiencing dizziness and disorientation.
Permission to go to sickbay. <br>
JANEWAY: Granted.

is hanging over a big drop. A young Tuvok is trying to save her.) <br>
GIRL: Help me, Tuvok! Please don't let go! Tuvok! Don't let me fall! <br>
(Tuvok staggers along the corridor.) <br>
GIRL: No! <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Tuvok
enters and collapses, eyes staring. Later, Janeway is present while the
EMH scans Tuvok.) <br>
TUVOK: I was holding a young girl by the hand, tying to prevent her
from falling from a precipice. I was unable to keep my grip, and she
fell to her death. And there is more. I had an emotional response
anxiety, fear. An almost irrational anger at myself for letting her
fall. <br>
KES: When did that happen? <br>
TUVOK: It never happened. The girl was unfamiliar, and I've never been
in that situation. It was me as a child, and it did seem like a memory,
but I don't recall the incident. <br>
EMH: Well, it was definitely a traumatic episode. Your heart rate
accelerated to three hundred beats per minute. Your adrenaline levels
rose by
one hundred thirteen percent and your neuroelectrical readings nearly
jumped off the scale. If you were human, I'd say you had a severe panic
attack. <br>
TUVOK: I am not human. <br>
EMH: No kidding. I don't know what happened to you, but there can be
any number of explanations. Hallucination, telepathic communication
from another race, repressed memory, momentary contact with a parallel
reality. Take your pick. The universe is such a strange place. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll have Mister Kim examine the sensor logs. Maybe our
proximity to the nebula is affecting you somehow. <br>
EMH: In the meantime, Lieutenant, you are free to go. All of your vital
signs have returned to normal, and I don't see any residual systemic
damage. But I want you to wear this neurocortical monitor. In case you
have another episode, it'll record a complete encephalographic profile
and alert sickbay at the same time. <br>
(The EMH places the device behind Tuvok's left ear.) <br>
TUVOK: A wise precaution, Doctor. Thank you.

has lit candles and is using bizarre building blocks.) <br>
TUVOK: Structure, logic, function, control. A structure cannot stand
without a foundation. Logic is the foundation of function. Function is
the essence of control. I am in control. I am in control. <br>
(But the house of not-cards collapses, then the doorbell chimes.) <br>
TUVOK: Enter. Kes. What is it? <br>
KES: The doctor wanted me to adjust your neurocortical monitor to pick
up additional peptide readings. I can come back later if this is a bad
time. <br>
TUVOK: No. You may proceed. <br>
KES: What are you working on? <br>
TUVOK: It is called a keethara. <br>
KES: Keethara. What does that mean? <br>
TUVOK: The approximate translation is structure of harmony. It is used
as a meditational aid. Building it requires precise balance and spatial
acuity. It helps to focus thought and refine mental control. <br>
KES: At the moment, it doesn't look very harmonious. <br>
TUVOK: No, it does not. <br>
KES: I'm curious. What does a keethara look like when it's done? <br>
TUVOK: The form is not predefined. It is a reflection of the builder's
state of mind. Thus, it is different each time. <br>
KES: I'd like to see it when it's finished. Well, good night. <br>
TUVOK: Kes. <br>
KES: It's all right. I understand. <br>

So how are you feeling this morning? <br>
TUVOK: If you are referring to yesterday's incident, I haven't
experienced any further problems. I am fit for duty. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I didn't ask because I'm concerned about your ability to
perform, I'm concerned about you. <br>
TUVOK: There is no need for concern. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Sorry I asked. <br>
TUVOK: My apologies, Commander. I am distracted. I spent fourteen hours
last night in deep meditation, trying to determine the source of my
aberrant behaviour. I could not. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe you should try to forget about it for a while. I've
found that when you don't think about a problem, sometimes the solution
comes to you.

It is difficult to forget when you're wearing a neurocortical monitor
on your parietal bone. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Good point. Mister Kim? <br>
KIM: I checked all the sensor logs. There's no sign of anything
emanating from the nebula that would have affected Tuvok or Voyager. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Anything unusual about the nebula itself? <br>
KIM: No, it's a standard class seventeen. <br>
TUVOK: I suggest we conduct a tachyon sweep of the nebula. It would
reveal the presence of any cloaked ships. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Cloaked ships? <br>
TUVOK: Yes. We should be extremely cautious this close to Klingon
space. <br>
TORRES: Tuvok, the Klingon Empire is on the other side of the galaxy. <br>
TUVOK: Yes. Yes, you are right, of course. I'm uncertain why I would
make such an obvious error. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe you should go back to Sickbay. Tuvok? <br>

</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EMH: I
think we may be dealing with a repressed memory. The memory engrams in
the dorsal region of the hippocampus are being disrupted. It's causing
physical damage to the surrounding tissue. In Vulcan medicine, this is
known as t'lokan schism. It means that the subject is inhibiting a
traumatic memory, which is beginning to resurface. <br>
JANEWAY: And that's causing brain damage? <br>
EMH: Strange, I know. In human subjects, repressed memories are nothing
more than psychological traumas which can be dealt with, with standard
therapeutic techniques. But in Vulcans, there is a physical reaction to
the battle between the conscious and the unconscious. In extreme cases,
the mind of the patient can literally lobotomise itself. <br>
JANEWAY: What's the treatment? <br>
EMH: There is no medical treatment for this condition. Vulcan
psychocognitive research suggests that the patient initiate a mind-meld
with a family member, and the two of them attempt to bring the
repressed memory into the conscious mind. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm the closest thing Tuvok has to a family member on this
ship. <br>
EMH: That's why I've asked you to come. He has a request to make of
you. <br>
(Tuvok is on a biobed, meditating.) <br>
TUVOK: Did the doctor explain the situation to you? <br>
JANEWAY: Yes. Tuvok, are you sure it's the right thing to do? <br>
TUVOK: I don't know how else to proceed. The doctor tells me that this
is a memory. And yet, no matter how hard I try, I cannot remember. If
the doctor is correct, if this is an experience I pushed into my
unconscious mind, it could be very dangerous to me, even
life-threatening. I realise it's asking a great deal of you, Captain,
and I did consider turning to one of the Vulcans on the ship, but this
meld would be more intimate than most. A family member is normally
chosen because of the implicit trust that usually exists. On this ship,
I trust you more than anyone else. <br>
JANEWAY: Whatever happens, I'll be there for you, Tuvok. I'll help you
get through this. <br>
TUVOK: I will initiate the meld and attempt to access the memory
fragment. Once that has been accomplished, you will act as my pyllora. <br>
JANEWAY: Your pyllora? <br>
TUVOK: My guide, my counsellor. You will help me reconstruct the memory
in its entirety. And as I am reliving it, yo
