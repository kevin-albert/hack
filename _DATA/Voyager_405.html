<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(In the absence of the Maestro, Katarina
is giving a sculpting lesson to her protégé. Leonardo's works in
progress include La Gioconda and Virgin and Child with St Anne. A bust
is on a stand. Seven has swapped her silver skin for a softer looking
brown catsuit.)<br>JANEWAY:
It's not as difficult as it looks. The first rule is, don't be afraid
of the clay. <br>
SEVEN: I fear nothing. <br>
JANEWAY: I mean you can't concern yourself with making a mistake, or
whether the image you had in your mind is what's taking form in front
of you. You just have to let your hands and the clay do the work. Here.
<br>(Janeway gives Seven some clay.)<br>JANEWAY: Go ahead. I think the nose could be a little stronger. <br>(Seven puts the lump on top of the existing nose.)<br>JANEWAY: Well, that's a
start. Keep going. <br>(Seven prods at the added lump.)<br>
SEVEN: This activity is truly unproductive. The end result has no use.
No necessary task has been accomplished. Time has been expended.
Nothing more.<br>
JANEWAY: That depends on how you look at it, doesn't it? I find
sculpting helps me unwind, relax.<br>
SEVEN: The concept of relaxation is difficult for me to understand. As
a Borg, my time was spent working at a specific task. When it was
completed, I was assigned another. It was efficient. <br>(Janeway sorts out the nose herself.)<br>
JANEWAY: So is this. It helps my own efficiency to forget about Voyager
for a while. I'd be embarrassed to show Maestro Leonardo something like
this but I get a great deal of pleasure in working the clay, in
creating something.<br>
SEVEN: But why here, in this simulation? Among these archaic objects and this disorganised environment.<br>
JANEWAY: Frankly, it's refreshing to take myself out of the
twenty fourth century every now and then. And a little disorganisation
can be very encouraging to the imagination. You might want to try it
sometime.<br>
SEVEN: Are you suggesting that I create one of these holodeck programmes?
<br>
JANEWAY: You might find it interesting. It's a way of exploring aspects
of yourself that probably didn't fit into your life as a Borg.
Imagination, creativity, fantasy.<br>
SEVEN: I am uncertain why those things are necessary. <br>
JANEWAY: They aren't necessary, Seven. But they're an important part of
one's life, because imagination frees the mind. It inspires ideas and
solutions, and it can provide a great deal of pleasure. Human progress,
the human mind itself, couldn't exist without them. When I was a child,
I studied these drawings. I even built some of these models. Da Vinci
was always a great inspiration to me.<br>
SEVEN: He was a very busy man. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, yes. A prolific artist, and a scientist as well. Far, far
ahead of his time. That design, for example. He conceived of an
airplane centuries before one was actually built. Seven?<br>(Seven looks at the bird-like structure hanging from the ceiling, and has a vision.)

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
It's happened three times now in different locations, at different
times of the day. I experience a series of disjointed images in my mind.<br>
EMH: Can you be more specific? Were these hallucinations? <br>
SEVEN: I don't know. I've never hallucinated. It's as if I were aboard
a Borg vessel, but I was frightened. I felt fear. Each experience is
similar. I'm being pursued by the Borg. They want to assimilate me. I'm
running from them, and then, and then, each time I see a bird.<br>
JANEWAY: A bird? <br>
SEVEN: Yes. A large black bird, flying toward me, shrieking, attacking
me.<br>
EMH: Hmm. Your hippocampus is in a state of agitation. <br>
SEVEN: What does that mean?<br>
EMH: As your human physiology continues to reassert itself,
psychological symptoms are bound to manifest in a variety of ways. Through dreams, hallucinations, hypnogogic regression. <br>
SEVEN: Hypnogogic regression? <br>
EMH: Flashbacks. You could be experiencing some sort of post-traumatic
stress disorder. <br>
JANEWAY: Makes sense. You were assimilated by the Borg. You've gone
through an intense, prolonged trauma. <br>
SEVEN: I was not traumatised. I was raised by the Borg. I don't see
them as threatening. Why would I experience fear? <br>
EMH: I don't know. <br>
SEVEN: Will I keep having these flashbacks? <br>
EMH: I'll need to study your neural scans further. In the meantime,
your digestive system is fully functional. Now is as good a time as any
for you to begin taking solid and liquid nutrients. <br>
SEVEN: Oral consumption is inefficient. <br>
EMH: And unnecessary, if you're lucky enough to be a hologram. But your
human physiology requires it. I'll draw up a list of nutritional
requirements. Take it to Mister Neelix in the mess hall. I hesitate to
inflict his cooking on you but it'll have to do. <br>
SEVEN: I do not enjoy this sensation. Something is happening to me and
I don't know what it is. It's as though I'm being driven somehow. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Chakotay to the Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Go ahead. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Our guests have arrived. They're being escorted to the briefing room. <br>
JANEWAY: On my way. Representatives of the B'omar. I've been trying to
negotiate passage through their space but so far they've been difficult
to deal with. I hope they've had a change of heart. <br>
SEVEN: I'll stay here and wait for the Doctor's instructions. <br>
JANEWAY: We'll help you through this, Seven. You'll be all right.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Briefing room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Have you had a chance to consider our request? <br>
GAUMAN: Congratulations, Captain. Against our better judgment the
B'omar Sovereignty
has agreed to grant your vessel passage through our territory. <br>
JANEWAY: On behalf of my crew, thank you. That will cut three months
off our journey. <br>
GAUMAN: However, there are a few stipulations. Guidelines that you must
adhere to. <br>
JANEWAY: You'll have our complete cooperation. <br>
GAUMAN: We expect nothing less. While in our space, your vessel will
not exceed warp three, and your weapons systems will remain offline.
You will avoid unnecessary scans and you will not conduct surveys of
any kind. You will make no attempt to explore our space and you will
avoid all communications with non-military craft. <br>
DUMAH: We've also plotted the course your vessel is to follow. <br>
PARIS: It'll take us weeks to follow that course. <br>(The course on the screen is more like a meandering river in a flood plain.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: If not months. <br>
DUMAH: We've designed this course so your ship would avoid our
populated systems and industrial areas. Deviation is not recommended. <br>
GAUMAN: There are a total of seventeen checkpoints where you will
submit your vessel for inspection. <br>
JANEWAY: Chancellor Gauman, if I may interrupt? I appreciate your
efforts in plotting this flight plan, but if we could, I'd like to
negotiate a course that's a little more direct.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Mess
hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Neelix is chopping vegetables when Seven enters.)<br>NEELIX:
Well. What an unexpected pleasure. Welcome to the mess hall. Would you
like me to show you around? <br>
SEVEN: My physiology has reasserted the need to process solid
nutrients. The Doctor has prepared a list of dietary requirements. You
will provide them for me. <br>
NEELIX: Let's see what we have here. Ah, two hundred fifty grams
glycoproteins consisting of fifty hree percent polypeptides and
twenty six percent fibrous glycogen. Urgh, doesn't sound very
appetising. However, a plate of my chadre'kab should satisfy most of
these essentials while providing a pleasurable culinary experience at
the same time. <br>
SEVEN: Pleasure is irrelevant. <br>
NEELIX: Well, I beg to differ. A good meal involves much more than
simply providing the proper nutrients. <br>
SEVEN: Why is that? <br>
NEELIX: Well, er, there's a certain satisfaction that comes from eating
food that's been carefully prepared. I'm sure once you try it, you'll
understand. Now, how would you like your chadre'kab? Boiled? Baked?
Stir fried? <br>
SEVEN: Preparation is irrelevant. <br>
NEELIX: Is irrelevant. Maybe, maybe not. This is the first time
ingesting food for you for quite a while. Er, we'll go a little easy on your
stomach. Steamed. <br>(Neelix puts the yellow lumps into a hot wok.)<br>NEELIX: Yes, this, er this recipe has been in my family for
generations. It's considered a delicacy among my people. <br>
SEVEN: You are Talaxian. <br>
NEELIX: Guilty as charged. <br>
SEVEN: Species two one eight. <br>
NEELIX: What? Oh, I suppose so. <br>
SEVEN: Your biological and technological distinctiveness was added to
our own. <br>
NEELIX: I hadn't realised that. <br>
SEVEN: A small freighter containing a crew of thirty nine taken in the
Dalmine Sector. They were easily assimilated. Their dense musculature
made them excellent drones. <br>
NEELIX: Well, lucky for you, I guess. <br>(He spoons the heated food onto a plate.)<br>NEELIX: Your nutrients. Follow me.
<br>(Neelix places the plate, a small vase of flowers and cutlery on a table.)<br>NEELIX: Please. <br>
SEVEN: Please what? <br>
NEELIX: It's customary to sit while eating. <br>(Neelix slides the chair under her as she sits.)<br>NEELIX: Is something wrong? <br>
SEVEN: I am unaccustomed to this. Borg do not sit. <br>
NEELIX: Well, this is a day of firsts, then, isn't it? <br>(He puts a napkin across her lap and sits down opposite.)<br>NEELIX:
Now. Take a
bite. Try that one. Just kind of er, scoop some up. That's the way.
Right into your mouth. Just like a little scout ship flying into a
shuttlebay. Take it out, but keep your mouth closed. That's it. Now
chew. Chew, chew, chew, chew. And swallow. Swallow. (Gulp)<br>
SEVEN: A curious sensation. <br>
NEELIX: You'll get used to it. Have some more. May I bring you
something else? A soothing cup of tea perhaps? <br>(Seven has a vision of a screaming Borg. A Borg implant erupts onto her right hand.)<br>
SEVEN: You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile. <br>(She gets up and pushes Neelix onto the deck before walking out.)<br>

permission to enter B'omar space to track her shuttle effectively. <br>
GAUMAN: Let's tally the events, shall we? First, you arrive uninvited
and unwelcome, requesting a shortcut through our space. Then you proceed
to unleash some sort of rogue Borg and now you want us to help you get
it back. <br>
JANEWAY: I apologise for what's happened here, but we certainly didn't
unleash anyone. We can resolve this situation quickly, gentlemen, if we
work together. <br>

competence. <br>
JANEWAY: May I remind you that you're still on my ship. <br>

being tracked as we speak. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tracked? How? <br>
DUMAH: Every vessel, every object, every particle of dust that crosses
our borders is immediately identified and traced by our perimeter grid.
<br>
GAUMAN: The Borg will be found and destroyed. <br>
JANEWAY: Chancellor. <br>
GAUMAN: There will be no sharing of information. From this point on,
your vessel will maintain a distance of at least five light years from
our borders. Any deviation will be considered an act of aggression. <br>

written in Borg alphanumeric code. <br>
KIM: I'm getting pretty good with the Borg language. I think I can
translate them. <br>
JANEWAY: Get on it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It seems we've made quite an impression on the B'omar. In the
last hour, they've doubled the number of ships patrolling their borders
and they've increased the sensitivity of the perimeter grid by thirty
six percent. <br>
JANEWAY: So much for diplomacy. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The Doctor analysed the data from Seven of Nine's last
transport. He's found something he wants us to see.&nbsp;Maybe this was inevitable. Even if Seven did want to stay on Voyager
her Borg nature may have won out. We can remove implant after implant,
but, maybe at her core, she'll always be part of the Collective. <br>
JANEWAY: No. I won't accept that.

Deck five. She was responding to us. Interacting with people outside
the Collective for the first time. She was adapting to this environment
and to this crew. But where is she going? We've scanned space for a
distance of forty light years. We've found no evidence of Borg ships, so
she can't be trying to rejoin the Collective. <br>
CHAKOTAY: She may plan to take the shuttle back to Borg space. <br>
JANEWAY: Ten thousand light years from here? I don't think so, no.
Something else going on. We're missing a piece of the puzzle. <br>
CHAKOTAY: In the meantime, the B'omar intend to find her. And if they
do, she'll probably resist them. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
What have you found, Doctor? <br>
EMH: Something most peculiar. This graphic represents the matter
conversion data from Seven of Nine's last transport. If you'll notice,
there's a high concentration of Borg organelles in the bone marrow and
lymphatic tissue. The dormant nanoprobes in Seven of Nine's cells have
reasserted themselves, taken over blood cell production and they're
growing new Borg implants. Thirteen percent of the Borg technology I
removed three weeks ago has regenerated in a matter of hours. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You said the nanoprobes in her bloodstream were dormant. What
reactivated them? <br>
EMH: I don't know, but I've developed a way to stop the process. This
hypospray contains a genetic resequencing vector. It should neutralise
the nanoprobes. <br>
JANEWAY: That means someone needs to get close enough to do it. </font></p>

Report. <br>
TUVOK: We've analysed the B'omar perimeter grid. It's sophisticated, but
not without its vulnerabilities. It might be possible to penetrate the
grid by re-calibrating our shields to match its frequency. <br>
PARIS: The trick is going to be our energy signature. Voyager's too big
to hide, but a shuttlecraft with the proper shield modulation and its
engines powered down could drift right through without so much as a
peep. <br>
JANEWAY: Nice work, gentlemen. Proceed. The Doctor's genetic
resequencer. It should keep her sedated until you get back to the ship.
Once you've penetrated the perimeter, there will be no further
communication with Voyager. You'll be on your own. <br>
TUVOK: Captain, it is possible that Seven will adapt to the
resequencer. <br>
JANEWAY: I know. If it fails and you're unable to reason with her, you
have my authorisation to stop her with any force necessary. <br>

TUVOK: Does that usually occur when a resonance signal is activated? <br>
SEVEN: No. <br>(The raven is watching her.)<br>
BORG [OC]: Seven of Nine, grid nine two of subjunction twelve. <br>
SEVEN: But I can hear them calling me. I'm frightened <br>
TUVOK: That's understandable. Lower the forcefield. We can return to
Voyager and find out what's happening to you. I am your shipmate. We
can return to Voyager together. <br>
SEVEN: I must rejoin the Collective.

footsteps, her actions during the last few days, but I'm still no
closer to understanding what's happened.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Janeway is in Seven's regeneration alcove.)<br>KIM:
Captain? Am I disturbing you? <br>
JANEWAY: Not at all, Harry. <br>
KIM: I've managed to decipher Seven's log entries. <br>
JANEWAY: And? <br>
KIM: There's nothing that indicates she was planning to leave the ship.
The entries are pretty unremarkable. She describes her daily routines,
number of hours spent regenerating, that sort of thing. There were some
personal log entries, mostly observations about the crew's
behaviour. I'm mentioned in quite a few of them. Apparently, she finds
my behaviour easy to predict, whatever that means. <br>
JANEWAY: Don't take it personally coming from Seven, that's probably a
compliment. <br>
KIM: The most recent entries are kind of strange. Descriptions of
bizarre images, almost like a record of her dreams. <br>
JANEWAY: The hallucinations. <br>
KIM: Maybe so. Sometimes she's in a Borg vessel, running or hiding
behind a bulkhead, falling down a shaft. Borg everywhere, chasing her.
Nightmarish stuff. <br>
JANEWAY: What about this bird? <br>
KIM: She mentions it several times. It flies at her, shrieking. I don't
know what it means. <br>
JANEWAY: The feathers are black, wingspan approximately one half metre.
The eyes are yellow and it has a powerful triangular beak. When it
looks at me, I am paralysed. I
cannot move. It seems to know me, but I don't understand how that's
possible. It's merely a bird, an inferior form of life, but the sight
of it fills me with fear. It sounds like she's describing a member of
the corvidae family like a crow, or a raven. She's describing a raven. <br>
KIM: Why is that important? <br>
JANEWAY: Because now I know what to look for.

SEVEN: Once I've been reintegrated into the Collective, my fears will
disappear. <br>
TUVOK: Deactivate the forcefield. I will accompany you to the surface.
You don't need to go alone. <br>
SEVEN: You would be assimilated. <br>
TUVOK: I don't believe so. I think this situation is not what it
appears. <br>

time. My father did experiments. They were very important, and we had
to travel a long way. I had my birthday here. My cake had six candles
on it, and one more to grow on. And then the men came. Papa tried to
fight them but they were too strong. I tried to hide. Maybe they
wouldn't find me because I was little, but they did. And Papa said we
were going to crash and the big man picked me up, and then suddenly we
weren't on the ship anymore. We were somewhere else. And then I became
Borg. <br>
TUVOK: Fascinating. This resonance signal must have been active since
the ship was
assimilated, and Voyager passed within range. <br>(Boom!)<br>

considering alternative possibilities. What if my parents and I had not
encountered the Borg? What would our lives have been? I would have been
raised by them, learned from them. It would have influenced what I
became, who and what I am. <br>
JANEWAY: And you would have done the same for them. If you'd like to
know more about your parents, there's information in the Federation
database. <br>

and for some rather unique scientific theories. You might like to read
what's there. It might encourage your imagination. <br>
