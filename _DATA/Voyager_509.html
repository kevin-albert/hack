prowls around the cargo bay, searching for something, then goes out
into the corridor. In the Mess hall she sniffs some food then knocks
other bowls onto the floor. She finds what she is looking for in a

When I checked the overnight sensor logs this little surprise was
waiting for me. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe I'm not quite awake, but it looks like it's over one
hundred kilometres wide. <br>
KIM: One hundred twenty. At first I thought it was an asteroid cluster,
until I picked up a residual warp signature. <br>
SEVEN: It was a Borg vessel. There are tetryon particles in the debris
consistent with the atmosphere inside a Cube. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Any idea what destroyed it? <br>
SEVEN: We would need to run close range scans of the hull fragments. <br>
KIM: Unless we alter course, we'll get our chance. The debris field's
directly ahead. <br>
JANEWAY: Then I suggest we cut a wide berth. Chances are the Borg will
send more vessels to investigate. Alter course to avoid the debris. If
that's all. <br>
NEELIX: Ah, one other piece of business, Captain. It seems we had
another incident in the Mess hall last night. <br>
TORRES: Return of the Midnight Snacker? <br>
NEELIX: I'm afraid so. <br>
JANEWAY: Casualties? <br>
NEELIX: A leg of Kelaran wildebeest I'd prepared for Ensign Ryson's
birthday. Since Commander Tuvok has been unable to round up any
suspects, I'd like to ask that stronger measures be taken. <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps an armed security detail. <br>
NEELIX: I'd like to ask permission to replicate some locking mechanisms
for the cabinet doors. <br>

on her PADD as Seven closes the door and walks on. Naomi comes around
the corner and is face to navel with Seven.)<br>SEVEN:
Naomi Wildman, subunit of Ensign Samantha Wildman. State your
intentions. <br>
NAOMI: I<br>
SEVEN: Very well. You leave me no choice but to report your activities
to the Captain. <br>
NAOMI: Please don't. I was just observing you. <br>
SEVEN: Explain. <br>
NAOMI: Well, Neelix told me that the Borg do a lot of things they do
because they're trying to be perfect. And even though you're not really
a drone anymore, you still try to be perfect. Don't you? <br>
SEVEN: Correct. <br>
NAOMI: Well, if I can learn to be perfect, too, then Captain Janeway
will have to make me her Bridge Assistant. <br>
SEVEN: No such rank exists aboard this vessel. <br>
NAOMI: Not yet. <br>
SEVEN: And you hope to achieve this goal by emulating me? <br>
NAOMI: Are you mad? <br>
SEVEN: No. There are many on this crew that would benefit from your
example. <br>
NAOMI: So you'll teach me?<br>
SEVEN: Your objective is admirable. However, your neocortical
development is incomplete. You would require several months of
accelerated growth in a Borg maturation chamber. <br>
NAOMI: Oh, I don't think I like the sound of that. <br>
SEVEN: Then I suggest that you <br>(The voices return briefly, then Seven turns and smiles at Naomi. Her voice is younger and slightly higher pitched.)<br>SEVEN:&nbsp; Hey. <br>

NAOMI: Like what? <br>
SEVEN: Swimming? <br>
NAOMI: Oh, I'm not allowed to go swimming without my mom. <br>

Take a look at this, will you? I'm picking up an energy signal in the
lower subspace bands, and if I'm not mistaken it's got a Borg
modulation. <br>
SEVEN: You are correct. It is Borg. I believe it's a neural interlink
frequency. <br>
TORRES: A what? <br>
SEVEN: A frequency that integrates the minds of Borg drones. <br>
TORRES: Can you pinpoint the origin? <br>
SEVEN: I will try. <br>

TUVOK: Computer, deactivate forcefield. Give me the phaser. (She does,
and he deactivates it before handing it to his colleague. Seven hears
the voices again. She stands.) <br>
SEVEN: You are not a physician, Commander. The logical course of action
would be to take him to the infirmary. <br>
TUVOK: Maryl? <br>

TUVOK: Yes. Please accompany me to Sickbay. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Seven. <br>
SEVEN: Captain, why am I here? <br>
JANEWAY: You've been unconscious for nearly two hours. We believe
you're experiencing a neurological disorder. <br>
SEVEN: Voices, I hear voices. They are agitated, chaotic. Too many
voices.&nbsp;<br>(We are treated to shots of screaming people prior to assimilation.) &nbsp;<br>SEVEN: Too many voices.<br>
EMH: The cortical inhibitor is destabilising. I'm increasing the
neurotransmitter levels. It's working. Do you still hear the voices? <br>
SEVEN: They are fading. They are gone. <br>
JANEWAY: All right. Let's see what we can do to keep them from coming
back. What's the last thing you remember? <br>
SEVEN: I was in Engineering, assisting Lieutenant Torres. <br>
TUVOK: You have no recollection of a confrontation with B'Elanna? <br>
SEVEN: Confrontation? <br>
EMH: I'm not sure why, but you seem to be manifesting personalities
other than your own. <br>
JANEWAY: Naomi Wildman claims the two of you played together for nearly
an hour this afternoon. <br>
TUVOK: You also attacked Lieutenant Torres. She told us you called
yourself Son of K'vok and that you initiated a Klingon mating ritual. <br>
SEVEN: I have no memory of those events. <br>
EMH: Come look at this. <br>
SEVEN: Doctor. <br>
EMH: This is your neural pattern. The memory engrams and synaptic
pathways that define you as an individual. Unfortunately, you're not
alone. Thirteen new neural patterns have emerged in your cerebral
cortex. Klingon, Vulcan, Terrelian, Human and several others I can't
identify. <br>
SEVEN: How? <br>
EMH: They're coming from within you. During your time with the Borg,
the Collective assimilated hundreds of different species. All of those
neural patterns were integrated into the Hive Mind. <br>
SEVEN: Of course. <br>
EMH: That means they're in your mind too, stored within your cortical
implants. Dormant until now. <br>
JANEWAY: From what we can tell, the various neural patterns are
surfacing randomly. <br>
EMH: In essence, you've developed the Borg equivalent of Multiple
Personality Disorder. <br>
SEVEN: Can you correct the malfunction? <br>
EMH: The cortical inhibitor is suppressing the effect, but it's only a
temporary measure. <br>
SEVEN: Lieutenant Torres detected a Borg interlink frequency. It could
be causing my cortical implants to malfunction. <br>
TUVOK: The signal appears to be emanating from the Borg debris field we
discovered this morning. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe we should jump to warp, try to get out of range. <br>
SEVEN: The signal permeates subspace. We cannot avoid it. <br>
EMH: Our only hope is to terminate the signal at its point of origin. <br>
JANEWAY: Set a course for the debris field. When we arrive we may need
your help. Feel up to it? <br>
SEVEN: Yes, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Keep a close eye on her, Doctor, in case she has any more
unexpected visitors. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(So the mobile emitter gets some use.)<br>EMH:
Has any drone ever experienced symptoms like these before? <br>
SEVEN: The Collective does not tolerate imperfection. Any drone with a
malfunction as serious as mine would be destroyed immediately. <br>
EMH: Lucky for you, this crew is a little more tolerant. <br>
NEELIX: Oh, there you are. Lieutenant Torres tells me you're under the
weather. <br>
SEVEN: Correct. <br>
NEELIX: Well, is there anything your Morale officer can do to help?
Assignments you need me to finish while you recuperate? <br>
SEVEN: No. <br>
NEELIX: I have some wonderful medicinal teas. Maybe I could prepare one
for you?<br>
EMH: Talaxian homeopathy. I don't think we're quite that desperate yet.
<br>
NEELIX: How about if I make one of your favourite nutritional
supplements? <br>
SEVEN: Your concern has been noted. The Doctor will inform you when I
am functional again. <br>
NEELIX: Right. Sorry. Oh! Ah, I almost forgot. It's from Naomi Wildman.
It's a drawing of Voyager, or maybe it's an asteroid belt. I'm not
sure. Naomi thought it might make you feel better. <br>
SEVEN: Tell her thank you. </font></p>

Bay two]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (The Doctor checks Systems Usage log 709.)<br>EMH: I
suspected as much. There were several interruptions in your
regeneration cycle. Eighteen minutes, five minutes, one hour. <br>
SEVEN: I don't recall them. <br>
EMH: Let's examine your neural function logs. Low serotonin levels
during regeneration, that's normal. But look at these spikes in the
pre-frontal synapses. They appear only seconds before you left the
alcove. You were sleepwalking. <br>
SEVEN: I don't remember entering this data file. <br>
EMH: Looks like we found the identity of the Midnight Snacker. I'm sure
Mister Neelix will be relieved. <br>
SEVEN [OC]: Personal log, Ensign Stone, Stardate 52188.7. I just
completed my first week of active duty. It was a nightmare. After four
years at the Academy I thought I was ready for anything, but Captain
Blackwood runs a tight ship, and he seems to take special pleasure in
tormenting new recruits. The First Officer tells me not to take it
personally, but it's hard to be objective when<br>
SEVEN: Blackwood. Captain of the Federation Starship Tombaugh. The Borg
assimilated that vessel thirteen years ago. <br>
EMH: The individual who made this recording must have been a member of
the crew. <br>
SEVEN: One of my victims. <br>
EMH: Here's another log entry. This one encoded for transmission. <br>
SEVEN [OC]: Hi. Guess who? I know I promised to write you every day but
that's simply not enough. How about once in the morning when I
resuscitate and once at night before I go into torpor, and I'll think
about you non-stop in between. Wait, I've got a better idea. Why don't
you leave your circle and visit the colony? You'd love it here, so <br>
EMH: Anything familiar? <br>
SEVEN: I helped to assimilate thousands of individuals. I do not
remember each of their names. <br>
EMH: Seven, you were a Borg drone who's now becoming an individual.
That's practically unheard of. There's bound to be rough spots along
the way. We just have to get past them. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Bridge to Seven of Nine. We're approaching the debris
field. <br>
SEVEN: Acknowledged. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Survivors? <br>
TUVOK: None. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Any sign of Borg vessels? <br>
PARIS: No, sir. We're the first ones here. <br>
KIM: I'm picking up the source of the interlink frequency. Bearing oh
two seven mark three. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. Magnify. <br>(A long thin thing with green components.)<br>
SEVEN: It's a Borg vinculum. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Vinculum? <br>
SEVEN: The processing device at the core of every Borg vessel. It
interconnects the minds of all the drones. It purges individual
thoughts and disseminates information relevant to the Collective. <br>
JANEWAY: It brings order to chaos. <br>
SEVEN: Precisely. <br>
JANEWAY: Looks like this one has established a link to your cortical
implant. <br>
SEVEN: I believe it has identified me as an errant drone. It is
attempting to reintegrate me into the Collective. The Vinculum is
malfunctioning. It is sending me erratic commands. <br>
TUVOK: Bringing chaos to order. <br>
SEVEN: Yes. <br>
JANEWAY: Can you sever the link? <br>
SEVEN: Not without risking permanent damage to my own systems. The
Vinculum must be taken offline. Permission to beam it aboard for
analysis. I have worked with this technology before. I may be able to
disable it. <br>
JANEWAY: We're talking about the heart of a Borg cube. I'd rather not
take it inside my ship. Can you disable it remotely? <br>
SEVEN: Yes, but I would need several days. The Borg may return by then.
I recommend we take the Vinculum and leave this region immediately. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok, prepare to beam it to Engineering. Erect a level ten
forcefield and maintain constant surveillance. The moment it poses a
threat, send it back into space. Tom, as soon as it's aboard, get us
out of here. Warp nine. <br>
PARIS: Aye, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: I understand what you're going through, and I want to help you
in every way I can, but the safety of this crew is my first
responsibility. We haven't had the best of luck with the Borg. <br>
SEVEN: Nor have I. </font></p>

Let's keep an eye on those antigrav struts. Boylen, lock out all
primary command consoles and reroute transporter controls to main
Engineering. <br>
BOYLEN: Yes, Lieutenant. <br>(The Vinculum is hanging in mid-air.)<br>
EMH: Seven? <br>
SEVEN: The voices. I hear them. <br>
EMH: It's your proximity to the Vinculum. The link is stronger here.
I'm adjusting your neurotransmitter levels. You'd better get started. <br>
SEVEN: Don't worry, Lieutenant. The Son of K'vok will not be joining
us. <br>
TORRES: Glad to hear it. Does this qualify as our second date? <br>
EMH: Just think of me as your chaperone. <br>
TORRES: So, where's the off switch? <br>
SEVEN: The Vinculum is equipped with many safeguards. I will need to
access its transneural matrix and disable it directly. <br>
TORRES: I'm reading a power surge. <br>
SEVEN: It's a normal response to my intrusion. Don't be alarmed.
Curious. I'm detecting an organism within the Vinculum. It appears to
be a viral agent. <br>
EMH: Let's see it. It's a synthetic pathogen. The virus was originally
a biological agent but it's mutated. It's attacking the Vinculum's
programmes as it would living cells. <br>
TORRES: An organism that attacks technology? <br>
SEVEN: The Cube was infected three days ago, shortly after assimilating
an alien shuttlecraft. Species 6339. They were the last ones to come in
contact with the cube. <br>
EMH: Looks like we found our Typhoid Mary. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Astrometrics
lab]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> SEVEN:
Species 6339, Humanoid. Warp-capable. Origin, grid one two four, octant
twenty two theta. They first encountered the Borg approximately four
years ago. Since that time, eleven billion individuals have been
assimilated. Three days ago, the Collective detected one of their last
surviving shuttlecraft. A Cube was sent to intercept it. <br>
EMH: We believe the virus was carried within their bodies. Once they
were assimilated, it spread to the Vinculum. <br>
SEVEN: The drones aboard no doubt experienced symptoms similar to my
own. It is no surprise they destroyed themselves. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd like to find species 6339. They may be able to help us
treat you. Begin long range Astrometric scans. See if they have any
more vessels in this region. <br>
SEVEN: Yes, Captain. I've already begun a spatial diagn. (voices) My, my, my,
look at the size of that thing. This viewscreen. It's got to be one of
the biggest I've ever seen. I'll give you twenty bars of latinum for
it. <br>
EMH: I think the inhibitor's gone offline. Would you come here, please?
<br>
SEVEN: Be quiet. Can't you see I'm in the middle of a deal? Name your
price, Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: Janeway. And you are? <br>
SEVEN: Daimon Torrot. <br>
JANEWAY: You're Ferengi. <br>
SEVEN: Of course I'm Ferengi. Is that some kind of insult about the
size of my ears? <br>
JANEWAY: No, not at all. I'd be happy to negotiate with you, but first
we have to get you to Sickbay. <br>
SEVEN: Sickbay? What for? <br>
JANEWAY: Because you're ill. <br>
SEVEN: I've never felt better. <br>
JANEWAY: Doctor. <br>
EMH: I'm afraid you've contracted a nasty strain of the Ankaran flu.
We've been treating you several days. Remember? <br>
SEVEN: No. <br>
EMH: Short term memory loss. It's one of the symptoms. Don't worry, it
isn't life threatening, but we'll need to treat you. In Sickbay. <br>
SEVEN: What is this treatment going to cost me? <br>
EMH: It's free of charge. <br>
SEVEN: Free? <br>
JANEWAY: Yes. <br>
SEVEN: You know, I have been having a nagging pain in my lower left
lobe, and while you're at it why don't you run a complete tricardial

Lucky for you, I know a medical supplier that can spruce this place up

percent? <br>
EMH: How generous of you. Computer, activate forcefield. <br>(Seven is trapped in the surgical bay.)<br>
SEVEN: Forcefield? You said I wasn't contagious. <br>
EMH: It's for your own safety. I've set the cortical inhibitor to

personalities are going to keep surfacing. <br>
SEVEN: I've been kidnapped! <br>JANEWAY: Even more reason to shut down the Vinculum as soon as we can. <br>
EMH: Even if we do break the link, it may be too late. Seven's own

Lieutenant Bergan. Have you seen him? <br>
JANEWAY: No, I'm afraid not. <br>
SEVEN: From the starship Melbourne. <br>
JANEWAY: Melbourne? <br>
SEVEN: I was supposed to meet him at Wolf 359, but Starfleet sent out a
warning that the Borg were attacking that sector. It was too late for
us to turn back. We were caught in a terrible battle. My ship was badly
damaged. We had to leave on escape pods. I never found out what
happened to Gregory. Please, I haven't heard from him in over three
days. Could you check with Starfleet Headquarters? <br>

SEVEN: I do not share your optimism. <br>(The forcefield is lowered.)<br>SEVEN: When you took me from the Borg and
began to turn me into an individual, I found the silence of my own mind
difficult to bear. I missed the voices of the Collective. But now that
I am an individual, those same voices frighten me. Captain, I don't know
if I can tolerate this condition much longer. My courage is

alone. Seven's having a rough time of it. The Doctor had to sedate her.
<br>
CHAKOTAY: How's the Captain holding up? <br>
JANEWAY: I've been better, Chakotay. In fact, I'm starting to wonder if
my First Officer was right all along. <br>
CHAKOTAY: About what? <br>
JANEWAY: You always said that bringing Seven into the fold might be
impossible. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You can take the Borg out of the Collective, but. I don't
believe that. Not anymore. I didn't think she'd last a day, much less a
year. I'd say you've proven me wrong. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
I've managed to stabilise her primary cortical functions but the woman
in Sickbay is not Seven of Nine. Not any more. New personalities are
emerging every few seconds now. She can't finish a sentence before the
next one rears its head. It's creating an incredible strain on her
cerebral cortex. If we don't deactivate the Vinculum soon, we may never
get her back. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok? <br>
TUVOK: Lieutenant Torres is taking measures to prevent the Vinculum
from adapting, but there's no guarantee she'll succeed. <br>
EMH: Captain, I've exhausted every viable treatment in my database. <br>
TUVOK: Then logic dictates we go beyond medical science. I will attempt
to mind meld with Seven of Nine. <br>
EMH: A mind meld? You consider that a viable treatment? <br>
TUVOK: Seven's neural pattern, her sense of self, is immersed in chaos.
I will attempt to isolate her true self and guide it to the surface. <br>
JANEWAY: It's dangerous enough to meld with one person, let alone
hundreds of different personalities. <br>
EMH: It's too risky. <br>
TUVOK: The risk is mine to take. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm aware of that, but is this our only option? <br>
TUVOK: I believe it is, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: How long would you need to prepare? <br>
EMH: Captain, you can't actually be considering this Vulcan mumbo
jumbo. <br>
TUVOK: I will require two hours of meditation. <br>
JANEWAY: Begin immediately. Report to Sickbay when you're ready. <br>(Tuvok leaves.)<br>JANEWAY: You
said it yourself. We've exhausted every medical treatment. <br>
EMH: I just hope I don't find myself with a second patient. <br>

JANEWAY: Commander? <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's them. Species 6339. <br>
KIM: Their vessel is well-armed, Captain. I'm picking up twenty two
phaser cannons on the aft section alone. <br>
JANEWAY: Hail them. <br>
KIM: They're responding. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. I'm Captain Janeway of the Federation Starship
Voyager. We recently found a piece of Borg technology. It's been
infected with a viral agent we believe was transmitted by your <br>
VEN [on viewscreen]: The Vinculum, you have it? <br>
JANEWAY: Yes. <br>
VEN [on viewscreen]: You've made a terrible mistake, Captain. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: A weapon? <br>
VEN: Yes. Since the Borg decimated our world, we've been looking for
ways to retaliate. <br>
JANEWAY: So you created a virus to infect their technology. <br>
VEN: Thirteen of my people were injected with the virus. They allowed
themselves to be assimilated so that the virus would spread to this
Vinculum. Once another Borg ship had retrieved it they would be
infected as well. Then another Cube, and another. We had the
opportunity to infect dozens, even hundreds of Borg vessels until you
interfered. Why? <br>
JANEWAY: Your virus has had one unexpected casualty. A member of my
crew. <br>
VEN: It wasn't designed to infect other species. <br>
JANEWAY: She's Borg. <rb> &nbsp;<br>
CHAKOTAY: We liberated her from the Collective over a year ago. She's
an individual now. <br>
JANEWAY: We were hoping you could help us treat her. <br>
VEN: We designed that virus to destroy Borg, Captain. We never
considered a treatment. I'm afraid your drone won't survive. But we
must return the Vinculum to the debris field immediately. If the Borg
arrive first, we'll have lost our chance, and those thirteen people
will have died in vain. <br>
JANEWAY: All right. We'll return it to you, but first we need to try to
save our crew member. We think we have a way to counteract the Vinculum's effects. B'Elanna? <br>
TORRES: I'm going to try to remodulate our dampening field to
compensate <br>
VEN: We don't have time for this. The Vinculum, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: I can't give it to you. Not yet. <br>
VEN: You scanned our vessel, you're aware of our firepower. <br>
JANEWAY: You could undoubtedly do significant damage to Voyager, and to
the Vinculum. Is that what you want? <br>
VEN: The Vinculum survived the destruction of one ship. What makes you
so sure it won't survive another? </rb></font></p>

EMH: It won't be long before I lose you again. It's my duty as your

EMH: Commander Tuvok has proposed a mind meld to help stabilise your
neural pattern. I had a similar reaction. If you don't approve. <br>
SEVEN: What is the probability of success? <br>
EMH: I don't know. A mind meld is hardly a standard medical practice. <br>
SEVEN: Are there any risks to Tuvok? <br>
EMH: He could suffer brain damage, but he's confident he'll be able to
break the meld before that happens. <br>
SEVEN: Even if we do shut down the Vinculum, it may not be enough. If
Tuvok can do anything to help me. <br>
