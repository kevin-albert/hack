Captain's log, supplemental. O'Brien needed three days to restore main
power to our commandeered Dominion ship, but he's not going to get
them. Sensors have detected two Jem'Hadar fighters heading our way, and
without main power our chances of survival are slim to none.

GARAK: Bearing three one zero mark two one five. Still closing. <br>
O'BRIEN: Nog, did you re-route the damned gyrodyne? <br>
NOG: I'm trying, but the damned thruster array won't take the input. <br>
O'BRIEN: Try the lateral impulse thrusters and watch your mouth. (to

DAX: I've already tried that. Still no power to weapons or shields. <br>
SISKO: Dax, there's a dark matter nebula sixty degrees above the bow.
Can we reach it? <br>
DAX: Yes. But that nebula's never been charted. We don't know what's in

GARAK: The Jem'Hadar ships are entering weapons' range. <br>

SISKO: Dax, get us into the nebula. Full impulse! <br>

REMATA'KLAN: What about the First and the Second? <br>
LIMARA'SON: I vaporised their bodies myself, and redistributed their
equipment to the rest of the men. You are now the First. <br>
REMATA'KLAN: No. I questioned the Vorta's orders. He will not forget
that. As long as he lives, I will remain Third. <br>
LIMARA'SON: You were right to question him. If he had not ordered us
into the nebula two days ago we would not have crashed. <br>

as hard as a rock. <br>
SISKO: I will make a note of that. What's the prognosis? <br>
BASHIR: Guarded, but good. The bleeding's stopped and I've repaired all
the internal injuries. The damage to the symbiont is a little harder to
diagnose. Given enough rest, I think they'll both make a full recovery.

send four thousand Dominion facilitators down to Bajor. Would you care
to elaborate? <br>
KIRA: It's only four hundred and how did you hear about that? The
official announcement isn't scheduled until tomorrow. <br>
JAKE: I hear things. So could you elaborate? My readers want to know
what's going on. <br>
ODO: You don't have any readers. Weyoun is still blocking the
transmission of your stories. <br>
JAKE: For now. But what if he changes his mind? Don't you want to
explain what's going on here to the outside world? <br>
KIRA: Ever since the war started, Bajor's been completely cut off from
all outside trade. We've had nowhere to turn for things like spare
parts or medical supplies. Nowhere, except the Dominion. So a group of
Facilitators is going to Bajor for a few months to provide some
technical assistance. <br>
JAKE: How do you respond to critics like Vedek Yassim who say that by
welcoming a group of Vorta to Bajor you're taking the first step toward
Dominion occupation? <br>
ODO: I have been assured that the Facilitators will be unarmed and
unaccompanied by any Jem'Hadar soldiers. <br>
JAKE: Odo, do you have any concerns that by joining the Ruling Council
here on the station, you're validating the occupation? <br>
ODO: The Dominion doesn't need my validation. They're here and they're
not leaving. Not without a fight, at least. <br>
KIRA: Are you finished? <br>
JAKE: Almost, almost. Will either of you be attending the demonstration
tomorrow? <br>
KIRA: The what? <br>
JAKE: Vedek Yassim has organised a demonstration on the Promenade
tomorrow afternoon to protest the Dominion occupation of the station. <br>
ODO: That's all the excuse Dukat will need to order a new security
crackdown. <br>
KIRA: I'll talk to Yassim. <br>

things. <br>
SISKO: Obedience Brings Victory. I was on a mission with the Jem'Hadar
once. Before the war, of course. They were good. Tough, professional.
It was an honour to serve with them. But their Vorta, he was something
different. Manipulative, treacherous, trusted by neither side. In the
end, he was killed by the Jem'Hadar First. Surprised? <br>
REMATA'KLAN: Such things have been known to happen. But they are rare
and only occur in units that have lost discipline. <br>
SISKO: Oh, you mean like a unit marooned on the shores of a deserted
planet? <br>
REMATA'KLAN: The Vorta has instructed me to give you his assurance that
neither you nor your Doctor will be harmed and you'll both be free to
leave at the end of your meeting. What is your response? <br>
SISKO: The word of a Vorta carries very little weight with me. Can I
have your assurance that we'll be free to go, Remata'Klan? <br>

KEEVAN: They're not here to protect me. They've just never seen what
the inside of a Vorta looks like.

SISKO: How was the show? <br>
REMATA'KLAN: Informative. <br>
KEEVAN: Ah, I am alive. <br>
BASHIR: No self-diagnoses, please. I'm the doctor here. Your internal
haemorrhaging has stopped, your free collagen levels are dropping,
tissue growth factors have stabilised nicely and there's a fifty
percent rise in cell oxygenation. You are alive. Careful. Your insides
are being held together by cellular micro-sutures and a lot of hope. <br>
KEEVAN: Leave us, and take your men with you. <br>
(The Jem'Hadar leave.) <br>
KEEVAN: May I have that case, please? <br>
(Bashir brings the Ketracel White box.) <br>
KEEVAN: There are ten Jem'Hadar soldiers on this planet, Captain. <br>
(Keevan opens the box.) <br>
KEEVAN: And that is the only vial of Ketracel White we have left. When
it's gone, my hold over them will be broken and they'll become nothing
more than senseless, violent animals. They'll kill everyone they can.
Me, you, the rest of your men, and finally turn on each other. <br>
SISKO: Why are you telling us this? <br>
KEEVAN: I'm ordering the Jem'Hadar to attack your base camp in the
morning. But I will provide you with their precise plan of attack. You
should be able to kill them all. <br>
BASHIR: They're your own men. <br>
KEEVAN: Yes. <br>
SISKO: You still haven't answered my question. Why are you doing this? <br>
KEEVAN: That's a communications system. It needs repair, but I'm
willing to bet that you've brought one of those famed Starfleet
engineers who can turn rocks into replicators. He should have a lot
more success at repairing it than a Jem'Hadar suffering from
withdrawal. Once you've take care of the Jem'Hadar, I'll give you the
comm. system and surrender to you as a prisoner of war. <br>
BASHIR: And you spend the war resting comfortably as a Starfleet POW
while your men lie rotting on this planet. <br>
KEEVAN: I see we understand each other. I'm going to order the
Jem'Hadar to attack your position tomorrow regardless of whether you
agree to my terms or not. So you can either kill them or they'll kill
you. Either way, they're coming. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Sisko draws the map in the sand.) <br>
SISKO: And when they've reached this point, we'll have them in a
crossfire. <br>
GORDON: They won't have a chance. <br>
GARAK: That is the point. In case, you've forgotten we're in a war. <br>
O'BRIEN: There are rules, Garak, even in a war. <br>
GARAK: Correction. Humans have rules in war. Rules that tend to make
victory a little harder to achieve, in my opinion. <br>
GORDON: So we just shoot them down? <br>
NEELEY: They wouldn't hesitate if the situation was reversed. <br>
NOG: But we're not the Jem'Hadar. It is our duty to <br>
SISKO: This isn't a vote. The decision's mine. And Mister Garak is
right. We are at war. Given the choice between us or them, there is no
choice. Let's move out. <br>
DAX: I'd say good luck, but I don't think you're going to need it. <br>
SISKO: Say it anyway, old man. I'm still hoping there's another way out
of this. <br>
DAX: In that case, good luck, Benjamin.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: Damar has been trying to contact you for the
past five hours. <br>
KIRA: I keep going over it and over it in my mind, and I can't believe
that I stood down there ready to use force to stop a protest against
the Dominion. Me. When I was in the Resistance I despised people like
me. I'm a collaborator, Odo. <br>
ODO: That's not true. You're doing exactly what Captain Sisko wanted
you and the rest of Bajor to do. Remain neutral and stay out of the
fighting. <br>
KIRA: We used to have a saying in the Resistance. If you're not
fighting them, you're helping them. Half the Alpha Quadrant is out
there right now, fighting for my freedom, but not me. What am I doing?
Eating a full meal every day, sleeping in a soft bed, I even write
reports for the murderers who run this station. <br>
ODO: This are difficult times for everyone. Do you think it's easy for
me to sit down with Dukat and Weyoun every day while they plot the
destruction of the Federation? <br>
KIRA: Odo, I'm not pointing a finger at you. I'm the one who told you
to get more involved in the first place. No, this is about me. This is
about being able get up in the morning and look in the mirror every
morning and not feel nauseated by what I see. Yassim was right. I have
to do something. I have to start to fight back. <br>
ODO: That would be a mistake. Active resistance will trigger a
crackdown. <br>
KIRA: Odo, I don't want to end up fighting you, too, but if I have to,
I will. <br>
ODO: All right. But let's find a more discreet place to plan the new
resistance.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Jem'Hadar are walking into the trap.) <br>
SISKO: Remata'Klan! I want to talk! <br>
REMATA'KLAN: Agreed! Hold this position. Do not fire unless they do. <br>
LIMARA'SON: Understood. <br>
(Sisko and Remata'Klan meet.) <br>
SISKO: There's no way out of this canyon and we have phasers locked on
every one of you. <br>
REMATA'KLAN: It appears you have a decisive advantage. <br>
SISKO: To fight a battle under these circumstances would serve no
purpose. I'm prepared to offer terms. Hear me out. I know that need
more Ketracel White. My doctor can sedate your men and keep them alive
until we're rescued. After that, we can put you into medical stasis
until we secure a new supply. <br>
REMATA'KLAN: The Vorta did not give me the option to surrender. <br>
SISKO: Keevan's betrayed you! He gave us your entire plan of attack
last night. <br>
REMATA'KLAN: It was obvious that approaching your position from this
canyon was a deliberate tactical error on his part. <br>
SISKO: You knew? <br>
REMATA'KLAN: I suspected. Despite what Keevan may think, the Jem'Hadar
are often one step ahead of the Vorta. <br>
SISKO: You can still stay one step ahead. Surrender. <br>
REMATA'KLAN: I have my orders. <br>
SISKO: Keevan doesn't deserve the unwavering loyalty you're giving him.
<br>
REMATA'KLAN: He does not have to earn my loyalty, Captain. He has had
it from the moment I was conceived. I am a Jem'Hadar. He is a Vorta. It
is the order of things. <br>
SISKO: Do you really want to give up your life for the order of things?
<br>
REMATA'KLAN: It is not my life to give up, Captain. And it never was. <br>
(Each returns to his men.) <br>
O'BRIEN: What did he say? <br>
SISKO: All the wrong things. <br>
REMATA'KLAN: Our death is glory to the Founders.) <br>
(The Jem'Hadar run forward, firing, leaving themselves easy targets.
It's over in seconds, but Gordon is also dead.) <br>
O'BRIEN: Captain? <br>
(The Vorta has arrived carrying the comm. unit.) <br>
KEEVAN: You know, Captain, if I'd had just two more vials of White you
never would have had a chance. <br>
SISKO: Chief, get this. Take him back to base camp and then get to work
on that comm. system. <br>
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. <br>
SISKO: Lieutenant Neeley. <br>
NEELEY: Sir? <br>
SISKO: Form a burial detail. <br>
NEELEY: Aye, sir. </font> </p>
