RIKER: I need that communicator. <br>
ETANA: Commander Riker to the Enterprise. I've a terrible problem down

ETANA: Open. <br>

RIKER: What am I seeing? <br>
ETANA: The playing field. <br>

ETANA: See the disc and the cone? <br>
RIKER: Yeah. <br>
ETANA: Concentrate. Make the disc go into the cone. <br>
RIKER: How do I do that? <br>
ETANA: Just let go. Relax. You'll do it. <br>
(the first one misses, the second is a success, and he gasps with
pleasure) <br>
RIKER: What was that? <br>
ETANA: Your reward for clearing the first level. <br>
RIKER: How far does this game go? <br>
ETANA: As far as you can take it. Would you like to go for level two? <br>

uncharted area called the Phoenix Cluster. We're all anticipating this
historic first look at the region.

new science teams just beamed in from the Zhukov. Quarters are filling
up fast. <br>
PICARD: On top of everything, there's been a change. We've been given
only two weeks to complete the exploration. <br>
RIKER: Two weeks? That's not enough time to explore a region that size.
I thought we had five weeks. <br>
DATA: Commander, Starfleet has added a diplomatic mission to Oceanus
Four. <br>
PICARD: Will, I'm leaving it up to you to make sure that all science
departments have an equal chance of completing their research. <br>
RIKER: That'll be quite a juggling act. <br>
PICARD: Oh, and one piece of good news.. We're to rendezvous with a
shuttlecraft carrying Wesley Crusher. He's on vacation from the
Academy. <br>
RIKER: Wesley? Good. We'll need an extra hand around here.

preparations? <br>
LAFORGE: I'm up to my neck in observation schedules right now. Our
biggest hurdle is sensor availability. <br>
RIKER: Especially since two new exobiologists and three stellar
cartographers have joined us from the Zhukov. <br>
LAFORGE: Fifteen science teams, only two weeks, and one long-range
array don't make for a great combination. <br>
RIKER: What about the lateral sensors? <br>
LAFORGE: They're booked solid for planetary observation. <br>
RIKER: And the gamma ray scanner? <br>
LAFORGE: We're reprogramming them now. Lefler, a moment of your time,
please? <br>

LAFORGE: You know Robin Lefler. <br>
RIKER: Of course. <br>
LAFORGE: Her work around here's been so sensational, I've decided to
make her a mission specialist. <br>
RIKER: Congratulations. <br>
ROBIN: Thank you, sir. <br>
RIKER: Okay, specialist, what's our sensor status? <br>
ROBIN: We're increasing the available bandwidth so more science teams
can use the sensors at once. We figured out a way to do it by
multiplexing the array. <br>
RIKER: Can we have that done before we arrive? <br>
ROBIN: Yes, sir. You can count on it. <br>
RIKER: Keep it up, Lefler. <br>
(Lefler leaves them) <br>
RIKER: Geordi, I brought something back from Risa that you have got to
try it. <br>
LAFORGE: I'd love to, but I'm running a full sensor recalibration in
ten minutes. Can it wait? <br>

TROI: I'm fine, Commander. <br>
RIKER: Would you like me to leave you two alone? <br>
TROI: No, you can join us. <br>
(she offers him a spoon) <br>
RIKER: No, thanks. I don't like fudge. <br>
TROI: Really? I never met a chocolate I didn't like. <br>
RIKER: Doesn't it taste good? <br>
TROI: Of course it does, but it's not just a matter of taste. It's the
whole experience. First of all, you have to spoon the fudge around the
rim, leaving only ice cream in the middle. Then, you gently spoon the
ice cream around the sides, like you're sculpting it. Relish every
bite. Make every one an event. And then, with the last spoonful, close
your eyes. <br>
RIKER: I had no idea it was such a ritual. <br>
TROI: Chocolate is a serious thing. <br>
RIKER: I brought something back from Risa. Better than chocolate. <br>

Wesley? <br>
WESLEY: Yeah. I thought after being on the Enterprise, it would be a
breeze, but there's a lot more to learn than just starship operations.
What was your first year like? <br>
DATA: Although I did extremely well scholastically, my lack of human
understanding often created social obstacles. <br>
WESLEY: Like what? <br>
DATA: I particularly remember the phenomenon of practical jokes,
several of which I fell victim to. <br>
WESLEY: Tell me about it. My first week that I was there, this guy
named Adam Martoni reprogrammed the sonic shower to cover me with mud.
It took me a while, but I got him back really good. <br>
DATA: Good for you. <br>
WESLEY: Thanks. <br>
DATA: I also found social gatherings difficult. There was one event, an
Academy tradition, the Sadie Hawkins Dance? <br>
WESLEY: They still hold it, every year. <br>
DATA: A notably awkward experience. <br>
WESLEY: I know what you mean. I can't even dance. <br>
DATA: Really? Your mother is quite an expert. She recently taught me. <br>
WESLEY: The Dancing Doctor? She tried to teach me too, but I just don't
have the knack. <br>

calibrating them by hand. <br>

photo and he remembered you right away. He said he's very proud of you
that you're Captain of the Enterprise. <br>
PICARD: Is he still tending grounds, or have the years finally caught
up with him? <br>
WESLEY: Not that I can tell. He took me on a grand tour of the place.

leads me to believe that it may have some harmful side-effects.
Specifically, sir, I think it's psychotropically addictive. <br>
PICARD: Addictive? What have you discovered? <br>
WESLEY: The game initiates a serotonin cascade in the frontal lobe of
the brain. Now I know that's nothing conclusive, but it could explain
why everyone is so attracted to it. And at the same time, it stimulates
the brain's reasoning centre. I don't know what that's all about. <br>
PICARD: I'll start an investigation immediately. Thank you, Mister
Crusher. <br>
WESLEY: Thank you, sir. <br>
PICARD: Wesley? It's good to have you back again. <br>
(Wesley leaves, and Picard picks up his headset for a game or three)

ROBIN: I've tried it, thanks. It's great. <br>
WESLEY: Robin. <br>
ROBIN: Where have you been? Everyone's after me to try it. <br>
WESLEY: I know. I got stopped in the corridor twice. I talked to the
Captain. He's going to look into it. <br>
ROBIN: I hope he makes a shipwide announcement or something, because
this thing is really starting to give me the creeps. <br>
WOMAN: Did you forget your games? <br>
ROBIN: We left them in our quarters. <br>
WOMAN: Well then, use mine. <br>
ROBIN: No, thanks. <br>
WOMAN: Try it. <br>
WESLEY: She said no thanks. <br>
(they get up and walk away) <br>
WESLEY: You know what else is really weird? If this game is so
addictive, there's only one person onboard we can be sure wouldn't be
affected by it. <br>
ROBIN: Data. <br>
WESLEY: Right. And he managed to get injured right when the game was
brought on board. We'd better take a look at him.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WESLEY: Maybe you should go check again. <br>
ROBIN: The nurse is still playing the game. <br>
WESLEY: I don't know what to make of this. There's brain activity all
his systems seem to be working. <br>
ROBIN: How can that be? He's unconscious. <br>
WESLEY: Maybe there's a signal breach between his brain and his body.
Let's map his nervous system and see if we can isolate a weak link.
Patch the neural output through to that station. Here. The signal stops
just below his cortex processor. There's some kind of damage. It's
almost undetectable. Let's look at it on the viewer. <br>
ROBIN: Wesley, look at that. <br>
WESLEY: It looks like some of his positronic links have been severed. <br>
ROBIN: The cuts are precise. Look how clean the edges are. Computer,
increase magnification, factor four. <br>
WESLEY: Only two people on board know enough about Data to do something
like this. Commander La Forge and my mother. <br>
ROBIN: Why would one of them do this to him? <br>
WESLEY: Maybe there's more going on here than we thought. What if
someone's trying to use the game for some purpose other than pleasure? <br>
ROBIN: Then Data would be a threat to that plan. And only with Data out
of the way would everybody become addicted. <br>
WESLEY: And everyone has. Except us.

(she looks round the door into his bedroom to see Wesley and Robin, on
the bed, playing the game. So Worf and Beverly leave) <br>
ROBIN: It worked. <br>
WESLEY: We should keep these mock-ups with us. We can't trust anyone
anymore. Not even the Captain. <br>
ROBIN: I'm supposed to be on duty in Engineering. I've got to get back
before Commander La Forge suspects something. <br>
WESLEY: Okay. When you get there, start accessing the codes for the
security tracking system. There's something I want to try. <br>
ROBIN: Wesley, don't forget Law Ninety One. Always watch your back. <br>

ETANA [on viewscreen]: Report. <br>
PICARD: Welcome, Etana. The Enterprise has been secured. We await your
further instructions. <br>
ETANA [on viewscreen]: The expansion will proceed as follows. Commander
Riker, you will pilot a shuttlecraft to the Cleon system, where you
will rendezvous with the starship Endeavour. Proceed with distributing
the device to that vessel. Commander La Forge, Counsellor Troi, take a
shuttle to Starbase sixty seven. Distribute the device to all starships
currently docked there. <br>
PICARD: We also have an opportunity to introduce the game to Starfleet
Academy. <br>
ETANA [on viewscreen]: Excellent. See to it. The Ktarians commend your
efforts, Picard. Once the expansion is complete, you and your crew will
be rewarded.

security sensors. I'll try bypassing his subcommands. Hold on. I'm
picking up a piece of his trail, sir. Sensors show power activation in

failed. <br>

WORF: Their weapons systems are substantially inferior to ours. They
are not a threat. <br>

RIKER: Data, we deactivated you. <br>
WESLEY: I managed to reconnect his positronic matrix. <br>
DATA: Wesley's subsequent diversions gave me adequate time to modify
the palm beacon. The optical burst patterns we
programmed were successful in counteracting the addictive effects of
the game. <br>
PICARD: And the rest of the crew? <br>
DATA: We programmed the main computer to transmit the same optical
burst to all display screens, work stations and terminals throughout
the ship. <br>
RIKER: That should reach almost everyone. Take a medical team to treat
the rest. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>

Ensign, lay in a course.
