SISKO: Still no idea what's causing it? <br>
DAX: It seems to be opening and closing completely at random. No

QUARK: She's not here. Is there anything else I can do for you? <br>
ODO: You find all this very funny, don't you? You and Dax probably
planned it together. <br>
QUARK: Planned what? <br>
ODO: Moving my furniture. <br>
QUARK: Is that what this is all about? Someone moved your furniture? <br>
ODO: Not someone. Commander Dax. It's the fourth time she's done it
this past year. She breaks into my quarters while I'm regenerating, and
moves all my furniture out of alignment. Shifts one piece three
centimetres to the left, the next four centimetres to the right. Not
one object in my quarters is where it's supposed to be. <br>
QUARK: And is that a bad thing? <br>
ODO: Everything I own is carefully and painstakingly arranged. Dax
knows this, and yet she takes a perverse delight in throwing my
quarters into chaos. <br>
QUARK: I'd hardly call three centimetres chaos. <br>
ODO: Maybe you wouldn't, but I do. You humanoids are all alike. You
have no sense of order. And Dax is the most humanoid person I know. <br>

want your solemn word that you'll stay out of my quarters. <br>
DAX: You've got it. So how long do you think you and Captain Sisko will
be on Earth? <br>
ODO: I've no idea. I just hope this trip isn't a waste of time. I'm not
sure what Captain Sisko and I can tell Starfleet about my people that
hasn't already been in our reports. <br>

spending most of my time in San Francisco at Starfleet Headquarters. <br>
JOSEPH [on monitor]: Whatever you do during the day is your business.
But at dinner time, you better get yourself down to New Orleans. No son

chop vegetables. He'll want you to wait tables.

wouldn't understand this, Quark, but when you care about a place and
it's in trouble, and you want to do something about it and you can't,
it's very frustrating. <br>
QUARK: I know exactly what you mean. When the Great Monetary Collapse
hit Ferenginar, I was hundreds of light years away, serving as a ship's
cook on a long haul freighter. I can't tell you the heartbreak I
suffered, knowing that rampant inflation and currency devaluation were
burning like wildfires through the lush financial landscapes of my
home. It still depresses me even today. I remember thinking my accounts
needed me, and there was nothing I could do. I felt so, so helpless. So

danger it's faced since the last world war. Something has to be done

NOG: Some of the cadets. They're kind of standoffish, especially the

JAKE: Because you're a Ferengi? <br>
NOG: That's what I thought at first. But then I heard some of the other
freshmen complaining about the same thing. <br>
JAKE: Complaining about what? <br>
NOG: Little things. For instance, there's this group called Red Squad
made up of all the top students. They're always going off on trips,
getting special training. None of them will even talk to me. <br>
JAKE: You've only been in the Academy for a month. You can't expect to
fit in right away. Who knows, one of these days you might even be in
Red Squad. I'm sure if you let them get to know you, show them you're a
good guy to be around, everything'll work out. <br>
NOG: I am a good guy to be around, aren't I? <br>

JARESH-INYO: Captain. I've seen your record. Most exemplary. <br>

LEYTON: Captain Sisko has several suggestions on how to combat Dominion
infiltration. I think you'll find them very interesting. <br>
JARESH-INYO: (reads the PADD) Hmm. I understand the need for increased
security, but blood screenings? Phaser sweeps? <br>
SISKO: They've proven very effective on Deep Space Nine. <br>
JARESH-INYO: I'm sure they have. But I hope you'll keep in mind that
this is Earth, and not a military installation. <br>
LEYTON: Which means it's a lot more vulnerable. We have to take
precautions. <br>
JARESH-INYO: Precautions may be advisable, but I will not disrupt the
lives of the population. Despite what happened at Antwerp, I believe
the changeling threat to be somewhat less serious than Starfleet does. <br>
LEYTON: Mister President, I assure you the threat is real. <br>
JARESH-INYO: For all we know, there was only one changeling on Earth,
and he may not even be here anymore. <br>
SISKO: But if he is here, we have a problem. There's no telling how
much damage one changeling could do. <br>
JARESH-INYO: Forgive me for saying so, Captain, but you sound a little
paranoid. <br>
SISKO: Do I? <br>
(Sisko's briefcase morphs into Odo) <br>
ODO: Forgive the intrusion, Mister President, but as you can see,
Starfleet has every right to be concerned. <br>
SISKO: Allow me to introduce Odo, my Chief of Security. <br>
JARESH-INYO: A very effective entrance, Mister Odo. <br>
ODO: One that never should have been allowed to take place. Admiral
Leyton and Captain Sisko walked in here without being searched, without
being blood-tested, and without having their possessions subjected to
phaser sweeps. <br>
SISKO: If Odo was a Dominion infiltrator, he could have killed you. <br>
LEYTON: Or replaced you. The way security is now, a changeling could
get anywhere on Earth, replace anyone, even you. <br>
SISKO: Mister President, all we want is your permission to increase
security at Federation and Starfleet installations here on Earth. Blood
tests will be limited to high-ranking Federation officials, Starfleet
officers and their families. The average citizen won't even notice the
difference. I wish these security measures were not necessary, but the
safety of Earth and the entire Federation depends on them. <br>
JARESH-INYO: You present a convincing argument, Captain. It seems I
have no choice but to accept your proposals. <br>
SISKO: Thank you, sir. <br>
JARESH-INY0: Don't thank me. If I could think of another solution, I
would use it. It took centuries for Earth to evolve into the peaceful
haven it is today. I would hate to be remembered as the Federation

should be able to stun any changeling we hit and force them back into a
gelatinous state. <br>
ODO: I'd push it to three point five just to be on the safe side. But
if you want to do any more tests, you'll have to get another guinea
pig. I've been shot quite enough for one day. <br>
SISKO: Three point five it is. I want these units installed in every
room at Starfleet and Federation Headquarters, then start working on
the orbital stations. <br>
BENTEEN: We'll have them in place by tomorrow night. I want to thank
you, Captain. <br>
SISKO: Thank me? For what? <br>
BENTEEN: For convincing the President to implement these security
measures. It feels like we're finally on the right track. <br>
(Benteen leaves.) <br>
ODO: Huh. You'd think she would have thanked me as well. I'm the one
who got shot thirteen times today. <br>
(Nog enters.) <br>
NOG: Captain Sisko. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. <br>
SISKO: We were just about finished. <br>
NOG: Can I speak to you for a minute? In private. <br>
(Odo leaves.) <br>
NOG: Captain, I just want to say I appreciate everything you've done
for me so far, and <br>
SISKO: Jake says you're having difficulty in school. <br>
NOG: He told you that? <br>
SISKO: He tells me everything. <br>
NOG: I don't want you to get the wrong idea. <br>
SISKO: Nog, you and I both knew that it was going to take a while for
you to adjust to the Academy and for the Academy to adjust to you. <br>
NOG: I know, but it turned out to be even more difficult than I
expected. <br>
SISKO: You're just going to have to stick with it. <br>
NOG: And I intend to. In fact, I think I've come up with something to
help me make some new friends. <br>
SISKO: Good. <br>
NOG: But I need your help. I want to join Red Squad. <br>
SISKO: Red Squad? <br>
NOG: What do you think? <br>
SISKO: I don't know what to think. I've never heard of it. <br>
NOG: It's an elite squad of cadets at the Academy. You know, the best
of the best. They get special classes, simulated missions, off-campus
training sessions, all kinds of things. <br>
SISKO: A group of elite cadets? They never had anything like that when
I was at the Academy. <br>
NOG: It's pretty new. It's a way of rewarding excellence among the
cadets. I have the grades to qualify, but I need to be sponsored by a
high-ranking officer. <br>
SISKO: And you want me to put your name in for consideration? <br>
NOG: All I'm asking for is a chance to prove myself. <br>
SISKO: I'm kind of busy right now, Nog. But if I get the chance, I'll
see what I can do. <br>
NOG: Thank you, sir. This means a lot to me. <br>
SISKO: I can see that. Dismissed, Cadet. <br>
NOG: Yes, sir.

JOSEPH: Well, look who's here. Come in, stranger. <br>
SISKO: Sorry. I haven't been around much lately. Things have gotten a
little busy. <br>
JOSEPH: You want to tell me about it? <br>
SISKO: I'm afraid I can't. <br>
JOSEPH: You'd think that Admiral could spare you for a few hours a day
to visit your father. With you in San Francisco and Jake off visiting
that school in New Zealand, it's like the two of you aren't even here. <br>
SISKO: You know, Dad, you could come and visit us at the station once
in a while. <br>
JOSEPH: Don't start that again. Earth's my home. It's where I belong.
Besides, what would happen to the restaurant if I went gallivanting
around the galaxy? You think Nathan can handle this place on his own? <br>
SISKO: Nathan will be running things around here sooner than you think
if you don't take better care of yourself. I had a talk with your
doctor and he tells me that you haven't been in to see him for eight
months. <br>
JOSEPH: The man's an idiot. He's lived in New Orleans twenty years and
can't tell the difference between Creole food and Cajun food. <br>
SISKO: Maybe not, but he can tell the difference between a healthy body
and one with progressive atherosclerosis. He says that if you don't
come in for vascular regeneration therapy, that this restaurant will be
looking for a new owner. <br>
JOSEPH: Ben, at my age, staying healthy is a full time job, and I am
too old to work two jobs. Now, how long until you're due back at
Starfleet Headquarters? <br>
SISKO: I've got about an hour. <br>
JOSEPH: Just enough time to take a walk to Audubon Park. You up for a
stroll with your old man? <br>
SISKO: I can't think of anything I'd rather do. <br>

BENTEEN: Odo. That was really something. I've never seen you imitate a
lifeform before. <br>
ODO: Well, I was just taking a little aerial tour of San Francisco.
It's quite nice. Not as ancient as the cities on Bajor but almost as
impressive. <br>
BENTEEN: It makes me wonder how many other changelings might be flying
around up there. <br>
ODO: If all they're doing is flying around imitating seagulls, we don't
have much to worry about. <br>
LEYTON: I doubt that other changelings are wasting their time imitating
birds. They don't all share Odo's lack of skill when it comes to
mimicking humans. <br>
ODO: That's right, they don't. I'm glad you're keeping that in mind. <br>
BENTEEN: Well, if you ask me, that was a pretty convincing seagull. <br>
ODO: Thank you. Though I'm not sure the gulls would agree. <br>
LEYTON: Commander, I think we've taken up enough of Mister Odo's time.
Keep practicing. You'll have those birds fooled in no time. <br>
ODO: Admiral. <br>
LEYTON: Yes. <br>
ODO: I know that Starfleet Command has always been a little uneasy
about a changeling working in their midst. I just wanted to say how
much I appreciate the trust you've shown in me. Thank you. <br>
(Leyton ignores Odo's outstretched hand) <br>
LEYTON: You're welcome. <br>
(So Odo grabs Leyton's arm and starts a Link) <br>
LEYTON: Well done, Odo. <br>

ODO: I'm not sure exactly. It's as if I could feel the changeling's
hostility toward me. <br>
SISKO: You're the only changeling who's ever harmed one of his own
people. I'm sure that hasn't made you many friends. <br>
LEYTON: What I'd like to know is, why was he imitating me? <br>
BENTEEN: You have access to all our security procedures, all our
protocols. That makes you a logical target. <br>
LEYTON: I suppose so. <br>
BENTEEN: The bottom line is a changeling infiltrated the grounds of
Starfleet Headquarters, imitated the Admiral, and got away scot-free.
Our security measures aren't working. <br>
SISKO: We're doing everything the President will let us do. <br>
BENTEEN: Maybe that's not enough. <br>
ODO: We could talk to the President again. <br>
LEYTON: I'm afraid that would be a waste of time. Jaresh-Inyo would be
a fine president in peacetime, but we have a war on our hands. He
doesn't seem to understand that. All he cares about is not upsetting
people. But humans are tougher than he thinks. We've created a paradise
here and we're willing to fight to protect it. <br>
SISKO: And you think the President isn't willing to fight? <br>
LEYTON: I think the President is a long way from home. This isn't his
world. We can't expect him to care about it the way we do. <br>

OFFICER: Captain, we never meant for things to get out of hand. <br>
JOSEPH: (in the kitchen area) What did you think would happen? Storming
in here and accusing me and my grandson of being a couple of
shape-shifters. <br>
OFFICER: We never accused you of being a shape-shifter, Mister Sisko.
We were just carrying out our orders. All family members of Starfleet
personnel are required to submit to blood screenings. No exceptions. <br>
JOSEPH: That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard of. Do you
believe that? <br>
SISKO: I should. I signed the orders myself. <br>
JOSEPH: Now why would you go and do a stupid thing like that? <br>
SISKO: Dad, it has to be done. <br>
JAKE: Grandpa, look, I'll take the test first. Go ahead. <br>
(So the young officer takes his blood. It's okay.) <br>

SISKO: Do it anyway. <br>

JOSEPH: Jake, do you think I'm a shape-shifter? <br>
JAKE: Come on, Grandpa. <br>
JOSEPH: Answer the question. <br>
JAKE: No, I don't think you're a shape-shifter. <br>
JOSEPH: At least somebody in my family has some sense. <br>
SISKO: Dad! <br>
JOSEPH: I don't want to hear about it. You take these two vampires and
tell them to either sit down and grab a menu or get out of my

OFFICER: But sir. <br>
SISKO: I would recommend the shrimp Creole. Look, Dad <br>
JOSEPH: I don't want to hear it. <br>
(Sisko joins Joseph in the kitchen.) <br>
SISKO: Listen to me. You have got to take the test. <br>
JOSEPH: Why should I? If I were an enemy spy looking to replace
someone, I think I could come up with better choices than an old chef. <br>
SISKO: Yeah, you're probably right. But this isn't about you. We've got
civilian
families living on starships and Starfleet installations all over the
Federation. The only way we can secure those facilities is to test
everyone there, whether they wear a uniform or not. <br>
JOSEPH: I'm not living on a Starfleet installation. <br>
SISKO: Dad, if we're going to test the family members of one Starfleet
officer, we must to test them all. <br>
JOSEPH: You may want to test everyone, but that doesn't mean we all
have to cooperate. I didn't take an oath to Starfleet. Neither did Jake
or your sister or anyone in your family. We have rights, Ben, including
the right to be as stubborn or thickheaded as we want. <br>
SISKO: Damn it, Dad. Can't you cooperate just one time? You don't take
your medication, you don't go to the doctor, you won't let Judith help
you in the restaurant. Just one time, please do what you're asked. <br>
JOSEPH: I wish I could, but what you're asking me to do is wrong. You
can't go around making people prove they are who they say they are.
That's no way to live and I'm not going to go along with it. Now, if
you want to make yourself useful, start some water boiling for the
shrimp. <br>
SISKO: Come on, Dad. Don't be this way. If I have to, I will get a
warrant <br>
JOSEPH: And what? Hold me down and force me to give you my blood?
Because that's the only way you'll get. Damn it. Now look what I've
done. <br>
(Joseph has cut his finger with his chopping knife. He puts it under
the tap as Sisko stares at the blood left on the knife.) <br>
JOSEPH: Jake? <br>
JAKE: Yeah? <br>
JOSEPH: I've got a dermal regenerator under the. Benjamin Lafayette
Sisko. What the hell has gotten into your head? You actually thought I
was one of them, didn't you? <br>
SISKO: I don't know. I wasn't sure. <br>
JOSEPH: This business has got you so twisted around you can't think
straight. You're seeing shape-shifters everywhere. Maybe you ought to
think about something for a minute. If I was a smart shape-shifter, a
really good one, the first thing I would do would be to grab some poor
soul off the street, absorb every ounce of his blood, and let it out on
cue whenever someone like you tried to test me. Don't you see? There
isn't a test that's been created a smart man can't find his way around.
You aren't going to catch shape-shifters using some gadget. The only
thing you can count on in this life is <br>

ODO: I've found that when it comes to doing what's best for you, you
humanoids have the distressing habit of doing the exact opposite. <br>
SISKO: I can't argue with that. But what bothers me is that for a few
minutes there, I really believed that my own father was a changeling. <br>
ODO: A reasonable assumption, considering the circumstances. <br>
SISKO: I don't care if it's reasonable or not. But when a son can't

transporters, surface-based defence installations. <br>

JARESH-INYO: I'm not interested in excuses. It is imperative we get the
power relay system functioning again. <br>
(Sisko, Odo, Leyton and two Security Officers beam in) <br>
LEYTON: Mister President. <br>
JARESH-INYO: How did you people get here? <br>
SISKO: We contacted the Lakota and used their transporters. Mister
President, as acting head of Earth Security, I must advise you to
declare a State of Emergency. <br>
JARESH-INYO: You're serious. With the exception of the Borg incident,
there hasn't been a State of Emergency declared on Earth in a century. <br>
SISKO: I am aware of that, but I have reason to believe that a Dominion
warfleet may be in the Alpha Quadrant headed for Earth. <br>
JARESH-INYO: Do you have evidence to back this up? <br>
SISKO: Just before we left Deep Space Nine, the wormhole was exhibiting
some unusual behaviour, opening and closing for no apparent reason. <br>
ODO: We didn't detect any ships coming through at the time, but the
Dominion might have been using some kind of cloaking technology. <br>
JARESH-INYO: I wasn't aware the Dominion had cloaking technology. <br>
ODO: The combined Cardassian and Romulan fleet that the Dominion
destroyed in the Gamma Quadrant was equipped with cloaking devices. Who
knows what my people might have taken from the wreckage? <br>
JARESH-INYO: How long until the power relays are fixed? <br>
LEYTON: From what we can tell, the changelings infected the system with
some kind of self-replicating computer
protocol. It jumped from one power relay to the next, disrupting every
system it came in contact with. <br>
ODO: The only way to correct the problem is to shut down the entire
grid, purge all the operating systems, and restart the relays. <br>
LEYTON: And that could take days. <br>
SISKO: Which is why it is imperative that you declare a State of
Emergency. <br>
JARESH-INYO: What good will that do when we have no way to defend
ourselves? <br>
LEYTON: Mister President, we can use the Lakota's transporters and
communications system to mobilise every Starfleet officer on Earth in
less than twelve hours. We've been preparing for something like this
for a long time. We have stockpiles of phaser rifles, personal
forcefields, photon grenades, enough to equip an entire army. I can
start getting men on the streets immediately. <br>
JARESH-INYO: What you're asking me to do is declare martial law. <br>
LEYTON: What I'm asking you to do is let us defend this planet. We
don't know what the changelings will do next, but we have to be ready
for them. Ben, tell him. <br>
SISKO: Sir, the thought of filling the streets with armed troops is as
disturbing to me as it is to you, but not as disturbing as the thought
of a Jem'Hadar army landing on Earth without opposition. The Jem'Hadar
are the most brutal and efficient soldiers I've ever encountered. They
don't care about the conventions of war or protecting civilians. They
will not limit themselves to military targets. They'll be waging the
kind of war that Earth hasn't seen since the founding of the
Federation. <br>
ODO: At the same time, my people will continue to undermine Earth's
defences in any way they can. This power outage is only the beginning. <br>
JARESH-INYO: I never sought this job. I was content to simply represent
my people on the Federation Council. When they asked me to submit my
name for election, I almost said no. Today I wish I had. <br>
LEYTON: We appreciate your feelings, Mister President, but we don't
have time for regrets. You accepted the job and now it's yours. <br>
ODO: Mister President, there are people all over this planet right now
huddled in the dark, terrified about what might happen next. They're
waiting for a sign, something to reassure them that everything will be
all right. But they won't wait long. Fear is a powerful and dangerous
thing. And if you don't act, if you don't show them that they're not
alone, then fear will surely take over. <br>
SISKO: Give us the authority we need, Mister President, and we will
take care of the rest. <br>
(There's a long pause, then Jaresh-Inyo taps his PADD - 4567 security
codes.) <br>
JARESH-INYO: Earth is in your hands, gentlemen. Do what needs to be
done. <br>
