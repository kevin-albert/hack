Ares Four to Kumagawa. How was the sunrise from down there? <br>(Kumagawa
is a woman, Kelly is a negroid man. He is watching a monitor showing a
couple in spacesuits with a rover down on the surface.)<br>
KUMAGAWA [OC]: Beautiful. There was a little green mixed in today. It
was really quite spectacular. <br>
KELLY: Sorry I missed it. <br>
KUMAGAWA [OC]: Next time, Lieutenant. <br>
KELLY: Any luck drilling through that lava plain? <br>
KUMAGAWA [OC]: Roger that. We broke through the iron oxide barrier and
we're down to eight metres. <br>(Another man joins the conversation.)<br>
NOVAKOVICH [OC]: We should have some samples by the end of the day if
all goes well. <br>
KELLY: On to more important matters. Received an uplink from
Houston. The Yankees won game five of the World Series. <br>
KUMAGAWA: You owe me twenty bucks. <br>
KELLY: It's not over yet. There's still game six. We won't be the only
ones making history today. Bokai just broke DiMaggio's record. <br>
NOVAKOVICH [OC]: I don't believe it. <br>
KELLY: If you ask me, Houston's been manipulating the stats. <br>
KUMAGAWA [OC]: They do have a few too many Kings fans at mission
control. <br>
KELLY: Well, how else do you explain Bokai beating out the Yankee
Clipper? <br>
KUMAGAWA [OC]: Commander? We lost you for a second there. <br>
KELLY: The ride got a little bumpy. Stand by. Picking up some turbulence. <br>
NOVAKOVICH [OC]: At your altitude? <br>
KELLY: Checking LIDAR. What the hell? <br>
KUMAGAWA [OC]: John, what's going on? <br>
KELLY: There's an object closing on my position, azimuth one twenty one
point six. Whatever it is, it's huge. It's over a thousand metres
across.&nbsp;<br>
NOVAKOVICH [OC]: How could something that big appear out of nowhere? <br>
KELLY: I don't know, but I'm getting out of its way. Firing thrusters. <br>
KUMAGAWA [OC]: It's probably just a solar flare. <br>
KELLY: Let's hope so. <br>(The object gets bigger.)<br>KELLY: It's no solar flare.

CREWMAN [OC]: This is transporter room two. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm trying to reach the bridge. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CHAKOTAY:
I see you're making some changes to the computer core. <br>SEVEN: I have enhanced the command sequencers with Borg algorithms. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Well, your enhancements are wreaking havoc with our secondary
systems. <br>
SEVEN: Insignificant malfunctions. I will correct them. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't recall authorising any modifications. <br>
SEVEN: The computer core is inefficient. It needed to be improved. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I appreciate your initiative, but that's not up to you. <br>
SEVEN: I've explained the value of these enhancements on several
occasions, but Lieutenant Torres chose to ignore me. I thought a
demonstration would be more persuasive. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Well, I doubt this one's going to change her mind. <br>
SEVEN: Clearly Voyager is not yet ready for assimilation. A joke. The
doctor suggested that I defuse tense situations with humour. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Good idea. Now how about getting these systems back up again
so I can get back to my book. <br>
SEVEN: We are experiencing a ship-wide power drain. This is unrelated to my
modifications.&nbsp;<br>
KIM [OC]: Senior officers to the bridge. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
It's two in the morning, Ensign. This better be more than a little
turbulence. <br>
KIM: You won't be disappointed. We've got level nine gravimetric
distortions closing on our position. <br>
TUVOK: They're emanating from subspace. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. Shields. <br>(The alien object from the teaser appears.)<br>
PARIS: It's heading right toward us. <br>
JANEWAY: Evasive manoeuvres. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Say good morning to thirty million terajoules of subspace
energy. <br>
PARIS: This thing is following us. I can't outrun it at impulse. <br>
JANEWAY: Go to warp. <br>
PARIS: It's disrupting our warp field. <br>
KIM: If it gets any closer the gravimetric stresses are going to rip
the plating off our hull. <br>
SEVEN: Captain, I recognise this phenomenon. It's Borg designation is
spatial anomaly five two one. It's attracted to objects that emit
electromagnetic energy. We have to cut power and reverse our shield
polarity. <br>
JANEWAY: Do it. (The object glides past Voyager.)<br>
PARIS: That was close. <br>
JANEWAY: I recognise this anomaly too. It's called a graviton ellipse.
According to the Federation Database it travels through subspace,
emerging occasionally without warning. Ellipses have only been observed
a handful of times. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Ares Four. <br>
TUVOK: Commander? <br>
CHAKOTAY: One of the early Mars missions. The Command module and its
pilot were engulfed by a similar phenomenon back in 2032. <br>
PARIS: I remember reading about that. Two astronauts were stranded on
the surface for weeks before a rescue ship arrived. <br>
CHAKOTAY: No one's gotten this close to a graviton ellipse and lived to
tell about it. This could be a remarkable opportunity. <br>
JANEWAY: Go to yellow alert. Keep our power output at minimum levels.
Match it's course and speed but maintain a safe distance. <br>
PARIS: Aye, Captain. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I suggest we launch a probe. See if we can find out what
makes this thing tick. <br>
JANEWAY: Make it fast. There's no telling when our visitor's going to
burrow back into subspace. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Astrometrics
lab]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
I'm receiving telemetry from the probe. It appears to have entered a
stable core within the
anomaly. The gravimetric forces are negligible. <br>
TUVOK: The eye of the storm. <br>
SEVEN: An apt metaphor. <br>
TUVOK: Computer, run a multispectral analysis of the anomaly's core. <br>
COMPUTER: Analysis in progress. <br>
SEVEN: The Borg developed shields to get through the gravimetric
currents. They intended to dissipate the
anomaly from within. Perhaps we should continue their efforts. <br>
TUVOK: It would be short-sighted to destroy it. We should study the
phenomenon. <br>
SEVEN: I didn't realise you shared this crew's penchant for
exploration. <br>
TUVOK: I am a Starfleet officer. <br>
SEVEN: When the risks outweigh the potential gain, exploration is
illogical. <br>
TUVOK: We can't predict what we might find here, Seven. One must allow
for the unexpected discovery. <br>
COMPUTER: Core analysis complete. <br>
SEVEN: There are more that two point eight billion compounds in the
core. <br>
TUVOK: Fascinating.<br>
SEVEN: The computer has isolated several synthetic compounds native to
sector zero zero one. <br>
TUVOK: Titanium and polymer composites. These materials date back to
the twenty first century. They were used in the construction of Earth's
early spacecraft. <br>
SEVEN: Commander Chakotay mentioned a space capsule that was consumed
by a graviton ellipse. <br>
TUVOK: These alloys are consistent with the hull of that capsule. An
unexpected discovery indeed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Briefing
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TORRES:
She was forty six metres, ninety two metric tons, powered by a
third generation ion drive, and equipped with a transpectral imager. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Ares Four was piloted by Lieutenant John Kelly. His ground
team, astronauts Rose Kumagawa and Andrei Novakovich, were close to
completing their survey mission when Kelly reported an object closing
on his position. Then he and the command module disappeared off NASA's
LIDAR scopes. <br>
PARIS: And into the history books. That incident almost derailed the
Mars programme. <br>
TUVOK: Mankind's first encounter with a spatial anomaly. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Seven, you said the Borg were working on a way to get inside
a graviton ellipse. <br>
SEVEN: Shield enhancements. <br>
PARIS: Well, maybe we could apply the same enhancements to the Flyer. <br>
SEVEN: Captain, do you intend to try to find the command module? <br>
JANEWAY: Or what's left of it. <br>
TUVOK: By my calculations, we have less than sixteen hours before the
anomaly goes back into subspace. <br>
JANEWAY: Then we have to work quickly. Harry, B'Elanna, help Seven
modify the Flyer's shields. Tom, review the database from the Ares Four
mission. It might tell us something about this
anomaly we've missed. We're going to need a mission leader. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I volunteer. <br>
JANEWAY: I thought you might. Let's do it. <br>(Everyone gets up and leaves, except Seven.)<br>JANEWAY: Something on your mind,
Seven? <br>
SEVEN: The anomaly is as dangerous and unpredictable now as it was
three hundred years ago. <br>
JANEWAY: But the Delta Flyer's a little more advanced than the Ares Four
was. We'll be taking every precaution. <br>
SEVEN: That may not be enough. <br>
JANEWAY: I appreciate your concern but, this is my call. <br>
SEVEN: Searching for the command module seems more sentimental than
scientific. <br>
JANEWAY: I can't argue with that. If scientific knowledge was all we
were after, then the Federation would have built a fleet of probes, not
starships. Exploration is about seeing things with your own eyes. In
this case, we're exploring the past. <br>
SEVEN: How will retrieving this artefact enhance your appreciation of
history? <br>
JANEWAY: By making us part of it. In the same way that excavating the
obelisks of ancient Vulcan, or finding the shroud of Kahless made those
explorers a part of their history. Here's the crux of it. As a Borg,
you didn't study the past, you ingested it. You've never really
developed an appreciation for humanity's history. Maybe this is an
opportunity to do some exploring of your own. <br>
SEVEN: Are you ordering me to join this mission? <br>
JANEWAY: Let's just say I'm encouraging you to volunteer.

[on screen]: It's no solar flare. Wow! <br>
KUMAGAWA [OC]: John, can you describe it? <br>
KELLY [on screen]: It's at least a thousand metres wide. Bright. <br>
NOVAKOVICH [OC]: Your transmission's breaking up. <br>
KELLY [on screen]: It's generating an electromagnetic radiation,
interfering with primary systems. I can't get away from it. Activating
the transpectral imager. I'll record as much data as I can. It's
right on top of me. I'll transmit as much as I can. <br>
PARIS: That's all she wrote. <br>
CHAKOTAY: NASA received Kelly's last telemetry at oh nine twenty two
hours, October 19th, 2032. <br>
PARIS: I thought I was the Mars buff. You seem to know more about the
Ares Four than I do. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The Mars missions paved the way for the exploration of space.
Kelly was one of my childhood heroes. <br>
PARIS: Mine too. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's dedication. The man's life is about to end, but he
won't stop taking readings. <br>
PARIS: Makes you wonder if those old-timers were made of sterner stuff
than we are. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You think we have it easy? <br>
PARIS: You kidding? Warp drive, shields, transporters. We're travelling
in the lap of luxury. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Kelly and Kumagawa, Armstrong and Glenn, they were the real
pioneers. <br>
SEVEN: Am I interrupting? <br>
PARIS: We were just admiring someone. Fellow explorer. <br>
SEVEN: Hero worship. The glorification of an individual's
accomplishment. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I guess you didn't have many role models growing up. <br>
SEVEN: In the Collective, personal accomplishments are irrelevant. The
shield modifications to the Flyer are complete. We're ready for launch.
<br>
CHAKOTAY: We? <br>
SEVEN: You'll need someone familiar with Borg technology to monitor the
shields. I'm volunteering. <br>
PARIS: You don't sound too happy about it. <br>
SEVEN: I'm not, but this mission can benefit from my expertise. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: I'm
preparing an inoculant to counter the effects of gravimetric
radiation. Of course, if you were a hologram, you'd simply adjust your
mobile emitter. That's what I did on Arakis Prime, one of my first away
missions. <br>
SEVEN: I don't recall that. <br>
EMH: This was before you came aboard. Such an enchanting planet.
Crystalline glaciers, magnesium vapour atmosphere. I had to stop my
metallurgical scans just to admire the sheer beauty of it. To smell the roses, to
coin a phrase. <br>
SEVEN: An inefficient use of your time. <br>
EMH: Perhaps. We're all finished here, except for one thing. Would you
record some images when you're inside the ellipse, for those of us not
lucky enough to make the trip? <br>(He hands her his holo-imager.)<br>
SEVEN: You envy my participation in this mission? <br>
EMH: There isn't a crewman aboard who doesn't. <br>
SEVEN: Why? <br>
EMH: I can only tell you how I felt that morning when I materialised on
Arakis Prime. I left my footprints in the magnesite dust and thought,
one small step for a hologram, one giant leap for mankind. <br>
SEVEN: To coin a phrase. <br>
EMH: Well, I know the sentiment isn't exactly original, but the fact
is, I was exhilarated. <br>

activity is creating a natural luminescence. Tom called it mood
lighting. <br>
PARIS [OC]: Hey B'Elanna, it's the perfect romantic getaway. <br>
TORRES: I'll take your word for it. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: We've detected asteroid fragments, pieces of vessels,
matter from every quadrant of the galaxy. Next time I lose something
I'll know where to look. Instead of a graviton ellipse we should call
it the kitchen sink anomaly. The chemical interactions have even
created a primitive atmosphere. <br>
PARIS [OC]: Nothing you'd want to breathe, of course. <br>
JANEWAY: What do you make of it, Seven? <br>
SEVEN [OC]: Well, I suppose it's intriguing. Some of the matter appears
to be extra-dimensional
in origin. <br>
KIM: Sounds like this anomaly's gotten around. <br>
JANEWAY: Any sign of the Ares command module? <br>
PARIS [OC]: We're picking up traces of the hull, but our sensor
readings are being refracted by all the debris in here. <br>(Whumph.)<br>
TUVOK: That was a gravimetric surge caused by the anomaly changing
course by point zero zero six degrees. <br>
JANEWAY: We just had a big jolt out here. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: We didn't feel a thing. <br>
JANEWAY: By our estimate you have five hours thirty six minutes before
the anomaly
returns to subspace.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
The fossilised microbes in this ore appear to have had metallic
membranes. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We've speculated about the possibility of metallic lifeforms, but we've never discovered one. <br>
SEVEN: You're excited by this discovery? <br>
CHAKOTAY: This piece of rock is billions of years older than Earth,
from a time when the galaxy was still forming. Here. <br>
SEVEN: Commander? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Take it. You're holding a piece of history. Maybe even the
beginnings of life itself. <br>
SEVEN: Unlikely. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's more likely than you think. This anomaly is as old as
anything we've ever encountered. I could spend a lifetime studying the
things it's collected. <br>
SEVEN: And leave Voyager without a First Officer? <br>
CHAKOTAY: They'd manage. Palaeontology was always my first love. It's
the reason I joined Starfleet. <br>
SEVEN: Why didn't you pursue it? <br>
CHAKOTAY: My sense of responsibility got in the way. First the Maquis,
then Voyager. What I wanted to be always seemed to take a back seat. Do
you remember what you wanted to be before you were assimilated? <br>
SEVEN: I was assimilated when I was a child. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I knew I wanted to be a palaeontologist when I was six. <br>
SEVEN: A ballerina. <br>

three degrees. <br>

attracting it. <br>
TORRES: There's nothing on the sensors. <br>
JANEWAY: I think it enjoys being unpredictable. <br>
KIM: We know it has a taste for electromagnetic energy. <br>
JANEWAY: So what could generate an EM field large enough to get it's
attention, but still not show up on sensors? <br>

How badly is he damaged? <br>
PARIS: He's got a severe concussion and internal injuries. We need to
get him back to Voyager. <br>
SEVEN: That may not be possible. Communications, shields and propulsion
are still offline. <br>
PARIS: He's stable for now. I'll give you a hand. <br>
SEVEN: We can repair the shields, but the engines are
unsalvageable.&nbsp;<br>
PARIS: It can't be that bad. <br>
SEVEN: It's worse. The ellipse showing signs of returning to subspace.
We have less than two hours. <br>(Later -)<br>PARIS:
He's regaining consciousness. Easy, easy. Lie still. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It feels like I just went ten rounds with an Andorian. <br>
PARIS: More like twenty. You were hit with a plasma discharge. The
gravimetric surge from the asteroid caught us at the edge of the
anomaly and tossed us back inside. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The command module? <br>
PARIS: It's adrift, three hundred metres off our port bow. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Then we can still salvage it. <br>
PARIS: Not so fast. We can't get engines or shields back online, not to
mention a tractor beam. We'll be lucky to get out of this in one piece.
<br>
CHAKOTAY: I can help. <br>
PARIS: You're in worse shape than this ship. You want to help? Lie in
the bed, doctor's orders. <br>
SEVEN: Another gravimetric surge. <br>
PARIS: I'll see if I can reinforce the structural integrity field. <br>(Paris goes to the cockpit.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: You might try drawing power from auxiliary life support. <br>
SEVEN: That system was damaged as well. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What about the secondary relays? <br>
SEVEN: They're offline. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That doesn't leave us many choices. Try rerouting the phaser
couplings. <br>
SEVEN: We explored that option while you were unconscious. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Then maybe you can bring me up to date. <br>
SEVEN: There's no time. I suggest you recuperate. We have the situation
under control. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It doesn't look that way from here. I'm still in command of
this mission. I want to know what's going on. <br>
SEVEN: Very well. We were ordered by the Captain to leave this anomaly,
but you chose to disobey that command. As a result of your obsession
with the module, we are now trapped along with it. In all probability we
won't survive without <br>
CHAKOTAY: Point taken. Now why don't you continue, without the
attitude. <br>
SEVEN: An inventory of the damaged systems. Read it for yourself. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I made a mistake. I put the mission at risk. <br>
SEVEN: You put our lives at risk. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Well, if we don't make it out, someone's bound to come
looking for us in a few hundred years. Defusing a tense situation with
humour, remember? <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Voyager to Delta Flyer. <br>
SEVEN: They're using a probe as a transmission relay. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Voyager to Chakotay, please respond. We can't detect you.
<br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, we can hear you. <br>
SEVEN: I'm matching their frequency. Voyager, this is the Delta Flyer. Respond. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Are you all right? What's your status? <br>
CHAKOTAY: We've sustained heavy damage, Captain, but we're alive. It's
good to hear your voice. </font></p>

It may be possible to modify a tractor beam to cut through the

PARIS [OC]: Excuse me? <br>
TORRES: The command module may be three centuries old, but the power
distribution system isn't that different from the Flyer's. Right here.
This control panel in the main cockpit. It was called an ion
distributor. With a few tweaks it could be modified to channel warp
plasma. <br>

when you set foot in that module, you'll be stepping into history. <br>
SEVEN: History is irrelevant. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Irrelevant? Do me a favour. When you're over there, download
whatever you can from their database. And also take a minute to look
around, so you can tell us what it was like. <br>

If there's a way in, there's got to be a way out. I'm gonna fire up the

data as I can. Jeannie, I may not be bringing you back the Mars rock,
but I promise you, I'm going to do everything I can to get home. <br>(Later.)<br>KELLY:
Ares Four, mission record, October 23rd. I'm starting to feel like
Jonah. How long was he in the belly of that whale? Three days? I got
him beat by a day or two already. The EM interference is disrupting
communications and LIDAR, and I can't see the stars. There's no way I
can get a fix on my position. If this thing's moving as fast as it was
when it pulled me in, I could be a long way from Mars by now. The
imager's been working overtime cataloguing all the matter in here, but
a lot of it defies analysis. I think we're going to need to make room
on the periodic table. Where the hell am I? Power levels have dropped
another fifteen percent since my last systems check.&nbsp; <br>(The module appears to hit something. A piece of another spaceship drifts past the porthole.)<br>KELLY: </font><font face="Arial" size="2">I think I just saw
