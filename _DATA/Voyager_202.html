JANEWAY [OC]: Voyager to shuttlecraft Drake. Prepare for emergency
transport. Mister Kim, can you hear me? We're attempting to lock on to
you. Harry? <br>
LIBBY: Harry? Hey, it's time to wake up. What's wrong? <br>
KIM: Libby. <br>
LIBBY: Yes? <br>
KIM: This can't be happening. <br>
LIBBY: What's wrong with you? <br>
KIM: Libby, it's really you, isn't it? <br>
LIBBY: Come on. You're going to be late. <br>
KIM: What? <br>
LIBBY: You have a meeting. Oh nine hundred, remember? You've only been
obsessing about it for a week. I don't want Lieutenant Lasca blaming me
because you weren't on time for the biggest meeting of your career. Now
get dressed and I'll make you some breakfast. <br>
(Later, Harry comes out of the bathroom in his uniform into his one
room apartment. The bed has pride of place under the windows.) <br>
LIBBY: Come on, the eggs are getting cold. What's with you today? <br>
KIM: The date. What's the date? <br>
LIBBY: The date? <br>
KIM: What day is today? <br>
LIBBY: 49011. <br>
KIM: So this isn't the past. It's the present. San Francisco. This
can't be a dream, it's too real. It's too clear. So what does that
leave. A holodeck? A hallucination? Some kind of trick? The last thing,
I remember was piloting a shuttlecraft on my way back to Voyager. <br>
LIBBY: We both have a long day ahead of us. Could we play this little
game another time, please? <br>
KIM: No, you can't be Libby. It's not possible. My name is Ensign Harry
Kim of the Federation Starship Voyager. Where am I? Is this some sort
of simulation? <br>
LIBBY: That's not funny, Harry, talking about Voyager like that. The
memorial service was only two months ago. Danny was your best friend.
How could you joke about it? <br>
KIM: Danny? Danny Byrd? <br>
LIBBY: I'm done with this conversation. Go to work. I'll see you
tonight. <br>
(Libby goes to get dressed.) <br>

leaves his apartment building in what according to a banner is the
Mission District of the Old Town, which is having a festival on August
14. It is completely pedestrianised, with a subway entrance. Harry
walks towards a coffee shop on the next intersection and the owner
calls to him.) <br>
COSIMO: Harry! Coming right up.<br>

Harry.)<br>
COSIMO: Here you go. Vulcan mocha, extra sweet. <br>
KIM: Thanks. <br>
COSIMO: So today's the big day, huh? <br>
KIM: What do you mean? <br>
COSIMO: You know, the meeting. The new ship you're designing. And don't
forget. You promised to bring me a model. And I'm going to hang it
right there in my window. And I'll tell everyone, Harry Kim, he
designed that ship. He came into my shop every morning. <br>
KIM: Look, I know this is going to sound a little funny, but how long
have I been coming to this coffee shop? <br>
COSIMO: How long? Well, let's see. Since you left the Academy. How is
that? Eight? Eight months. <br>
KIM: Eight months. And you've seen me every day? <br>
COSIMO: Well, not every day. You like to sleep late on Sunday. But if I
had your fiancée, I'd sleep late too. <br>
KIM: Fiancée? We're getting married? <br>
COSIMO: Ah, yes. There were many mornings I woke up, I said the same
thing to myself when I was about to be married. But don't worry, it'll
pass. <br>
KIM: I don't think you've ever had a morning quite like this one. <br>
(Another Starfleet officer calls to Harry.) <br>
LASCA: Hey, Harry! You ready to go? <br>
KIM: Er, where? <br>
LASCA: Very funny. Come on. We'd better get moving if we're going to
catch the transport to Headquarters. <br>
KIM: I, I'm not sure I can go. I'm not feeling very well. Maybe I
should just go home. <br>
LASCA: Come on. Come on. It's just a case of the jitters. You'll do
just fine. <br>

LASCA: Relax, Harry. If all goes well, you'll walk out of this room a
Lieutenant. Let me see that warp coil schematic. <br>
KIM: The what? <br>
LASCA: The coil diagram. The one with the new plasma flow equations. <br>
KIM: I forgot to bring it. <br>
LASCA: Forgot? Harry, we need that diagram to show that we worked out
the dilithium fracture problem. <br>
KIM: I'm sorry. <br>
LASCA: Well, we'll just have to improvise. <br>
(A middle aged Admiral enters.) <br>
STRICKLER: Good morning. I have a meeting at eleven hundred hours with
the head of Starfleet Security. She doesn't like to be kept waiting.
Let's get this underway. Lieutenant Lasca? <br>
LASCA: Thank you, Admiral. <br>
(Lasca calls up a schematic on the wall screen.) <br>
LASCA: Ladies and gentlemen, you are looking at the new runabout
Yellowstone. It's equipped with tetryon plasma warp nacelles, and
designed for a variety of mission profiles. <br>
STRICKLER: Yes, Lieutenant. I've looked over your specifications. It's
an interesting design. But how do you propose to address the dilithium
fracture problem? Tetryon plasma tends to disrupt subspace. <br>
LASCA: I'm actually glad you asked that question, sir. We've been
working on the problem for several weeks, and I think you'll see that
we have found an answer. I'd like to introduce you to the engineer who
designed these new warp engines, and I might add, he is the most
promising young engineer to come out of the Academy in a long time.
Ensign Harry Kim. Harry?<br>
STRICKLER: Is there a problem, Ensign? <br>
KIM: Actually, sir, there is. <br>
LASCA: (sotto) Come on, Harry. Pull it together. We've been waiting for
this for six months. <br>
STRICKLER: Ensign, are you ill? <br>
KIM: Yes, sir. I'm very ill. I would like to continue this presentation
at a later date. <br>
STRICKLER: Well, unfortunately, Ensign, I'm leaving for a three week
tour of the Cardassian border in a few days. It will have to wait until
after then. <br>

with Libby, are we? Ah, to be young. Don't worry. I'll keep your

What can I do to help? <br>
KIM: Just tell me you love me. <br>
LIBBY: I tell you that every day. Aren't you getting sick of hearing
it? <br>
KIM: No. In fact, pretend I haven't heard you say it in a long time.
Pretend that we haven't seen each other for months. <br>
LIBBY: Okay. I love you, Harry. Welcome home. So, if we haven't seen
each other for months, where have you been? <br>

LIBBY: A mission? <br>
KIM: Yeah. We got a little lost. <br>

KIM: There's nothing going on, okay? <br>
LIBBY: You're not a very good liar, Harry. You've been acting strange
all day. And I'm not the only one who's worried about you. Lieutenant
Lasca called this afternoon. He said he's never seen you so agitated,
so don't tell me there's nothing going on. <br>
KIM: Libby, it's hard to explain right now. And I do want to tell you,
but I need you to trust me. <br>
LIBBY: I do trust you. I love you. That's why I'm marrying you. I would
hope you would have the same trust in me. <br>
KIM: All right. This, this is going to sound a little crazy from your
perspective, but I am not who you think I am. <br>
LIBBY: Oh? <br>

together? <br>
KIM: Try Voyager. <br>
PARIS: Ah, Voyager. Well, sorry to disappoint you, but I never set foot
on that ship. And I can't say that I'm sorry, considering what happened
to it. <br>
KIM: You know about the mission to the Badlands? <br>
PARIS: Oh, yeah. Captain Janeway asked if I'd help her track down that
Maquis ship in exchange for an early release from the penal colony. <br>
KIM: But you said no? <br>
PARIS: What? Are you kidding? I said yes! It sounded better than
Starfleet Rehab. Anyway, I got as far as Deep Space Nine, where I got
into a bar fight with a Ferengi, and I was thrown into the brig by a
very unpleasant shapeshifter. Janeway tried to get me released but my
parole was revoked by Starfleet Command. Voyager left without me. <br>
KIM: That Ferengi, was he trying to sell you Lobi crystals? <br>
PARIS: Yeah. How do you know about that? <br>
KIM: Because I was there. In my reality, anyway. Tom, I know this is
going to sound crazy, but I was on Voyager and so were you. You never
got into a bar fight with that Ferengi. You stopped him from selling me
Lobi crystals. And you did lead us into the Badlands. <br>
PARIS: You're right. That does sound crazy. <br>
KIM: Something's happened. Somehow, reality has been changed. A
temporal anomaly, an alien influence, I can't explain how. All I know
is that it's true. I was in a shuttlecraft heading back to Voyager, and
then I woke up here on Earth. <br>
PARIS: What is it you want? <br>
KIM: Come with me to Starfleet Headquarters. Help me run a computer
simulation of what happened on that shuttle. You're the best pilot I've
ever seen, and if anyone can figure it out, it's you. <br>
PARIS: (laughing) You had me there for a minute. You really did. But
then you blew it. <br>
KIM: What are you talking about? <br>
PARIS: You're not getting me to set foot inside Starfleet Headquarters.
So you tell whatever admiral or captain who sent you that I'm not
interested in being another pawn in one of their games. <br>
KIM: It's not a game! <br>
PARIS: Oh, it isn't? Oh, that's a shame. I like games. <br>
KIM: You once told me that you used to treat life like one big game.
Rules, players, winners, losers. You never took any of it seriously
until you lost. <br>
PARIS: You know, you're starting to annoy me. <br>
KIM: You also told me you were afraid of what would happen to you if
you didn't take Captain Janeway up on her offer. Now I see why. <br>

telling the truth, but we have to consider all the possibilities. <br>
KIM: Like what? <br>

centres altered so that you think what you're saying is the truth. Or
you could be an alien masquerading as Harry Kim. <br>

morning? <br>

STRICKLER: You have poor taste in friends. Thomas Paris is a convicted
traitor and a Maquis sympathiser. Now, what did you talk about with
him? <br>
KIM: I tried to tell him what's happened. I wanted his help. <br>
STRICKLER: His help to run a shuttle simulation. Why? <br>
KIM: To figure out how I got here and how I can get back. There must be
a temporal anomaly somewhere or. You think I'm a spy, don't you. You
think I'm working for the Maquis. <br>

be. <br>

counsel. <br>

telling us doesn't make much sense. All we know so far is that you have
been seen talking with a Maquis criminal, and you've broken into
classified Starfleet records. Until there is something else, something
concrete, those are the facts in this case, and you have to admit, the
facts look pretty bad. <br>
(A security officer enters and puts an ankle tag on Kim.) <br>
STRICKLER: We will be monitoring your movements until further notice. I
believe you know the restrictions. No off-world travel, and if you
tamper with the anklet, Security will be immediately alerted and you
will be formally charged. Do you understand? <br>
KIM: Yes, Admiral. <br>

KIM: Who are you? <br>
COSIMO: We exist in what you would call a temporal inversion fold in
the space-time matrix. It's not necessary to understand. It only
matters that there was an accident. Your shuttle intersected one of our
time streams, and boom! A few things were altered as the result of the
accident. History and events were scrambled a bit, and you ended up
here. <br>

COSIMO: We only know that an accident occurred. We don't know how or
why. <br>
KIM: Well, that's not good enough. There's got to be something we can
do. Where is this time stream of yours? Maybe I can use it to get back.
<br>
COSIMO: The time stream weaves through the galaxy like a thread. I
could show you how to find it, and you could try to recreate the
conditions that existed before the accident, and fly back into it, but
there's no guarantee what will happen to you if you do. <br>
KIM: What do you mean? <br>
COSIMO: Well, you may be able to change reality again, but there's no
way to predict how it would change. You could end up at any point in
the space-time continuum. You might return to your original reality, or
you might find yourself a billion years in the future. Or at some time
before sentient life even existed on your planet. <br>
KIM: I guess I'll have to take that chance, because somehow I have to
get back. <br>
COSIMO: Are you so sure? This is a pretty good place for you, Harry.
You have a wonderful job with Starfleet, a beautiful woman who loves
you. Why be so quick to turn your back on all this? Maybe this is your,
er, fate. Isn't that the word your people use? That thing which was
meant to be? Hmm? Seems to me you're actually a very lucky man. <br>
KIM: What about Danny Byrd? He isn't so lucky. And Tom Paris? Fate
wasn't so kind to him. No, it isn't supposed to be this way. I'm
supposed to be on Voyager in the Delta Quadrant. And that's where I
have to go. <br>
COSIMO: Very well. <br>

can't let it go. In some ways, it'd be a lot easier to forget about
Voyager, just settle in here and build a life. But that wouldn't be me.
You wouldn't be getting the Harry Kim you fell in love with. Does that
make any sense? <br>
(The anklet starts beeping.)<br>
KIM: The tampering alarm. Security will be here any second. I'd better
go. I promise you, I'm going to try to get back. It may take a while,
and I may not make it, but I swear, I will try. <br>
(Security beams into the alcove. Kim gets out onto the fire escape.
Libby closes the window and stops the security officers from
following.)
LIBBY: Sorry. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Street]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(A
security officer dives at Kim from a lower level window, and gets
elbowed for his trouble. Kim makes it to ground level.) <br>
SECURITY: Hold it! <br>
(The chase is on.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Another
street]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Kim is
rugby tackled to the ground, then the security guard takes out his
phaser.) <br>
SECURITY: Get up! <br>
PARIS: Excuse me. <br>
(Paris punches the security guard. Very hard.) <br>
PARIS: Ow! There goes my bank shot. <br>
(Paris takes the phaser.) <br>
KIM: What are you doing here? <br>
PARIS: Helping out a friend. Let's go. <br>
(The crowd do not stop them.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Alleyway]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM: So,
how did you find me? <br>
PARIS: I still have a few friends at Starfleet. They told me you were
in some serious trouble. <br>
KIM: Yeah. Starfleet thinks I'm a Maquis spy. <br>
PARIS: I know the feeling. Those security anklets really chafe, don't
they? <br>
KIM: You're the last person I expected to help me. <br>
PARIS: Let's just say it's been a long time since anybody gave a damn
about my future, including me. I don't know if I'm supposed to be on
Voyager like you've told me, but it sounds a whole lot better than the
life I have here. I'm willing to take my chances, Ensign. <br>
KIM: Call me Harry. You always did. <br>
PARIS: Won't be long before they find us. We better keep moving. <br>
KIM: Wait. I found a way to get back to my reality. The problem is I'll
need a ship to do it. I think I have access to a runabout, but I'm
going to have to break it out of Spacedock. <br>
PARIS: Sounds to me like you need a pilot. <br>
KIM: Know anyone who's qualified? <br>
PARIS: I know someone who used to be pretty good. And if I'm not
mistaken, he still knows a few tricks. <br>
KIM: I have an office at Starfleet Headquarters. I think we can access
the runabout launch codes from there. <br>
PARIS: Site-to-site transporter. With friends like mine, you never know
when it'll come in handy. Where's your office? <br>
KIM: Main complex, level six, subsection forty seven. <br>
PARIS: I can beam us in. But we'll only have a few minutes before
Security starts kicking down the door. <br>
KIM: Let's do it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Kim's
office]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
So, Harry, once we're on board the runabout, what's the plan? <br>
KIM: The alien said that if I recreate the conditions of the accident
and fly into the time stream, there's a chance I might be able to get
back into my reality. <br>
PARIS: Might? <br>
KIM: He couldn't give me any guarantees. <br>
PARIS: Security's just been alerted to an unauthorised transport in the
building. It'll take them another twenty seconds to track it to this
office. How are you coming? <br>
KIM: Almost there. I've bypassed the runabout's security lockouts.<br>
PARIS: They're onto us. We've got to go.<br>
KIM: Hold on. I almost got it. <br>
(Security enter.) <br>
PARIS: Now! <br>
(One of the security officers fires his phaser. They duck behind the
drafting
board and there is a transporter sound.)

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>
[Runabout Yellowstone]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM:
Overriding initialisation codes. Main power coming online. <br>
PARIS: Let's get those engines going. <br>
KIM: Powering up main fusion reactor. <br>
COMPUTER: Intruder alert. Unauthorised launch in progress. <br>
PARIS: Space doors closing. <br>
KIM: Warp core and main propulsion are online. <br>
PARIS: Releasing docking clamps. Moorings clear. Here we go. <br>
(Paris does the traditional ninety degree roll to get through the gap
in the space doors.) <br>
PARIS: We're clear. <br>
KIM: I'm entering the coordinates of the time stream into the main
computer. <br>
PARIS: Adjusting course to match. Going to full impulse. <br>
KIM: We've got a starship on our tail. Nebula class. <br>
PARIS: I'll try to lose them, Harry, but they're a lot faster than we
are. <br>
MAN [OC]: Attention runabout Yellowstone. Power down your engines or we
will open fire. <br>
KIM: They're going to try to do everything they can to stop us. They
think we're trying to steal this prototype. <br>
PARIS: They're closing to five thousand kilometres. <br>
(Bang!) <br>
KIM: Shields down to seventy percent. Fifty percent. <br>
(Bang! Sparks.) <br>
KIM: Twenty nine percent. <br>
PARIS: I thought you said this ship was new and improved. <br>
KIM: It is, but it looks like they haven't finished working on the
defensive systems. In fact, some of the safety interlocks aren't even
in place. A few more of those hits and I don't. <br>
(Bang!) <br>
KIM: We're losing antimatter containment. Attempting to stabilise the
field. <br>
PARIS: We're approaching the coordinates of the time stream. <br>
KIM: The containment field is weakening. We could be looking at a core
breach. <br>
PARIS: The ship's closing to three thousand kilometres. <br>
KIM: If we can't shake them off, maybe we can slow them down a little.
This runabout is equipped with tetryon plasma warp nacelles. <br>
PARIS: So? <br>
KIM: Tetryon plasma emits multiflux gamma radiation. It disrupts
subspace. <br>
PARIS: We could vent the warp plasma. The second they hit the plasma
cloud, their engines would stall. Give us a few seconds of breathing
room. <br>
KIM: Exactly. <br>
PARIS: Unlocking the warp drive manifold. <br>
KIM: Venting drive plasma. <br>
PARIS: Any second. They've dropped to one tenth impulse. Our
containment field's at critical. We'd better hurry. <br>
KIM: All right. Let's recreate my shuttle accident. I think I was
travelling at one hundred and forty thousand kph. <br>
PARIS: You think? <br>
KIM: Look, that was another lifetime. I'm doing the best I can. <br>
PARIS: Increasing speed to one hundred and forty thousand kph. <br>
KIM: Now, I also remember running a polaron scan. The scanning beam was
sweeping at a radius of half a million kilometres. No, wait. A quarter
million. Activating polaron scan. That should do it. <br>
PARIS: Approaching coordinates. Impact in four, three, two. <br>
KIM: Did we miss it? <br>
PARIS: We passed through the coordinates, but the runabout was
unaffected. The starship has repowered its engines. They'll be here in
under a minute. <br>
KIM: I have to get into that time stream. Wait a minute, I'm forgetting
something. The emergency transport. The last thing I remember hearing
was Captain Janeway's comm voice. She said she was trying to beam me
off the shuttle. That's it. I've got to beam off the ship.<br>
PARIS: Are you crazy? <br>
KIM: We have to recreate all the conditions of the accident, including
that one. We just lost antimatter containment. Twenty five seconds to
core breach. <br>
PARIS: I've locked onto the time stream. Get on the transporter pad. <br>
KIM: Not yet. The core is breaching. We've got to shut it down first. <br>
PARIS: There's no time. That ship'll be here in another thirty seconds.
<br>
KIM: In fifteen seconds this ship is going to explode. You'll be
killed. <br>
PARIS: Look. If you're right, then things will be changed back to the
way they're supposed to be, and you'll find me back on Voyager. <br>
KIM: And if I'm wrong, if this doesn't work, you'll be blown up right
here. <br>
PARIS: Go! <br>
(Paris pushes Kim onto the transporter pad and activates it.
Yellowstone goes KaBOOM!)

Mister Kim, can you hear me? We're attempting to lock on to you. Harry?
<br>

JANEWAY: Lieutenant. <br>
TORRES: The anomaly is sending out heavy subspace distortions. I can't
get a positive lock on him. <br>
PARIS: The hull is starting to buckle under the stress. He won't
survive much longer. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok, can you boost the transporter signal? <br>
TUVOK: Negative. The signal is at maximum gain. <br>
PARIS: Ten seconds to hull breach. <br>
JANEWAY: He's just out of reach. B'Elanna, can you tie the transporter
directly into the main deflector dish? Use it to extend the signal? <br>
TORRES: I'll try. <br>
PARIS: Hull breach in progress. <br>
TORRES: We've got him, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Chakotay, analyse the sensor logs. I want to know what
happened out there. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Voyager to Transporter room two. Are you all right, Mister
Kim? <br>
KIM [OC]: I think so, Captain. Is Lieutenant Paris there? <br>
JANEWAY: Yes, he's here. Why? <br>
KIM [OC]: It's a long story. <br>
JANEWAY: I look forward to hearing it. I'll be in my Ready room. <br>
(A little later, Kim enters.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: We think your shuttlecraft was caught in some kind of
temporal anomaly. <br>
KIM: A time stream? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes, you could call it that. <br>
KIM: I've already been briefed, Commander. <br>
PARIS: Welcome back. Kind of a rough ride, huh? What is it, Harry? <br>
KIM: I owe you one. </font> </p>
