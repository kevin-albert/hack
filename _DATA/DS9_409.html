BASHIR: Ah yes, well, tricorders. Very accurate with live people, not
so accurate with dead ones. We learn that first year medical school. <br>
KIRA: Well, I was very impressed, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: And well you should have been. I impressed myself on this one
actually. I can't imagine what other doctor would even consider
examining the scapular nodes for parasitic infection. I just seem to
have a talent, I suppose. A vision that sees past the obvious, around
the mundane, right to the target. Fate has granted me a gift, Major. A
gift to be a healer. <br>

BASHIR: Relax. I'm a doctor. <br>
KAJADA: What happened? <br>
BASHIR: You lost consciousness. Now listen, is there anyone else aboard
your ship? We've got to evacuate it. <br>

out. I've managed to stabilize the structural integrity field, but I
don't know how long it's going to last. We'll have to tow it in. <br>
BASHIR: His synaptic fields are dissipating. I can't get a neural

BASHIR: Preliminary examinations indicated the subject died of a
massive respiratory failure, brought on by the pulmonary trauma
suffered during the fire. <br>
KAJADA: Are you sure it's the same body? <br>
BASHIR: Quite certain. It's been sealed in here ever since our arrival.
<br>
KAJADA: Have you run a retinal imaging scan? <br>
BASHIR: What for? <br>
KAJADA: To confirm that there is no residual activity in the visual
cortex. <br>
BASHIR: Miss Kajada, I assure you he is dead. <br>
KAJADA: He's faked his death more times than I can tell you. And the
last time someone thought he was dead, they didn't live to regret the
mistake. <br>
BASHIR: He was a murderer? <br>
KAJADA: That description doesn't do justice to the horrors he's
responsible for on my world. He's quite brilliant in his way. A man of
science who killed others to prolong his own life. I've tracked him for
twenty years. <br>
(She stabs the corpse) <br>
KAJADA: Please perform an autopsy. I want his identity confirmed with a
DNA reference scan. <br>
BASHIR: Of course. <br>
KAJADA: And have someone scan my ship. I want to make sure there are no
anomalous life forms on board. <br>

DAX: Thank you, Quark. <br>
QUARK: At your service, day or night. <br>
DAX: Thanks. <br>
(Dax leaves) <br>
QUARK: Poor woman. She's obviously infatuated with me. <br>
ODO: You're deluding yourself. <br>
QUARK: There's nothing wrong with a good delusion. I sell them upstairs
to dozens of people every day. Besides, there is something in her eyes
when she looks at me. <br>
ODO: An allergic reaction, no doubt. <br>
QUARK: I think she's lonely. <br>
ODO: Dax? She has ten lifetimes worth of friends to call on before she
calls you. And every man on the station would like to be buying her a
raktajino. <br>
QUARK: Ah, but I'm the one with the raktajino machine. <br>
ODO: She seems to prefer spending most of her time alone, which I
understand perfectly. <br>
QUARK: Then that must make her the perfect woman for you. <br>
ODO: I wouldn't intrude on her privacy, as some would. <br>
QUARK: You're pathetic. You think everyone in the galaxy should be as
lonely and as miserable as you are. As hard as it may be for you to
understand, some of us like company. The sound of a friendly voice. The
sight of a familiar face. The feel of smooth, pliant flesh. <br>
ODO: Why do you bother? <br>
QUARK: It's good to want things. <br>
ODO: Even things you can't have? <br>
QUARK: Especially things I can't have. <br>
ODO: Like the deuridium shipment? <br>
QUARK: Deuridium shipment? Is there a deuridium shipment coming here? <br>
ODO: I'm watching you, Quark. <br>
QUARK: And I'm watching you, Jadzia. <br>
(Dax and Quark's eyes meet, and she smiles so Quark goes over to her
table) <br>
PRIMMIN: (Starfleet Lieutenant) Interesting technique. Do you always
get ready for an important operation by leaking word about it to the
local black market? <br>
ODO: How I handle my business is none of your concern.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Promenade]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PRIMMIN: I'm afraid it is. Lieutenant George
Primmin. Starfleet security, and if you don't mind, I would like to
talk to you about the deuridium shipment from the Gamma Quadrant. <br>
ODO: There's nothing to discuss. Security is already in place. <br>
PRIMMIN: I would appreciate it if we could go over it anyhow. It took
me three weeks to get here and I'd hate to think it was for nothing. <br>
ODO: If you insist. Meet me in my office at seventeen hundred hours.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Ops]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: The autopsy revealed nothing out of the
ordinary. Fingerprints, cerebral cortex scans, retinal patterns all
matched up perfectly with the records Kajada provided. Vantika may have
faked his death before, but I don't think he's faking this time. <br>
SISKO: Why was he coming here? <br>
BASHIR: They're Kobliad. <br>
DAX: The deuridium. <br>
KIRA: I'm sorry? <br>
SISKO: The Kobliad are a dying race. They need deuridium to stabilize
their cell structure. It prolongs their lifespan. <br>
DAX: The Federation's been working to supply them with deuridium, but
even the new deposits from the Gamma Quadrant aren't enough to service
the whole population. It's so scarce that some of the Kobliad have gone
underground to get it. <br>
KIRA: So he was coming here to hijack a shipment? <br>
DAX: Exactly. <br>
SISKO: Is Kajada satisfied with your autopsy? <br>
BASHIR: I don't think anything's going to convince her he's dead,
Commander. <br>
DAX: Vantika has been the focus of Kajada's attention for most of her
adult life. In a way, they were as intimately connected as any two
beings could be. <br>
SISKO: Let's do her the courtesy of granting her requests as long as
they're not too far out of line. A quick sweep of her ship is not too
much to ask. I'm more concerned that Vantika might have had help here
waiting to hijack the shipment. Ah, Mister Primmin. Good. In my office.
I want to brief you on a security issue that's arisen. <br>
KIRA: I'll get Odo up here. <br>
PRIMMIN: Ah, that's okay, Major. I'll fill him in later on anything he
needs to know.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: How are you getting on with the Constable,
Lieutenant? <br>
PRIMMIN: I'm sure he's very good at keeping order down there on the
Promenade. <br>
SISKO: But <br>
PRIMMIN: Frankly, isn't the security of a deuridium shipment a little
over his head? I mean, he was chatting about it in the bar with that
Ferengi, Quark. If I could overhear it, so could half-dozen others. <br>
SISKO: It's hard to keep a secret in a place like this, Lieutenant.
It's not a starship. <br>
PRIMMIN: I understand that. <br>
SISKO: I'm sure almost everyone knows about the shipment by now. Odo
was probably making sure Quark knows we know he knows. <br>
PRIMMIN: It's not they way they taught us at the Academy, is it, sir.
If you want my opinion <br>
SISKO: Actually, I don't. You and I are guests of the Bajorans,
Lieutenant. You don't have to forget what you learned at the Academy,
you just don't throw it in anyone's face here. If you're really smart,
you might even learn a few new things about station security from our
Constable. Clear? <br>
PRIMMIN: Very clear, sir. <br>
SISKO: Now, regarding the shipment. We've been made aware of a possible
Kobliad plot to hijack the deuridium. You and Odo ought to have a talk
with Kajada, the Kobliad security officer who arrived yesterday </font></p>

for us getting off on the wrong foot. <br>
ODO: Think nothing of it. <br>
PRIMMIN: Listen, I know this is your bailiwick. I don't mean to be
throwing my weight around. No hard feelings? <br>
ODO: None at all. <br>
PRIMMIN: Just because I'm from Starfleet Security doesn't mean I don't
respect your opinion. How about showing me what you've got and I'll see
if there's anything we can work with. <br>
ODO: Lieutenant, you're welcome to see my plans, but I assure you I've
taken every precaution regarding the shipment. However, if you have any
suggestions, I'd be happy to hear them. (Database services not
available) What? Odo to Ops. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO [OC]: Sort of computer problem? <br>
(She checks her console) <br>
KIRA: Everything in active memory has been accessed and purged.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: That's impossible. <br>

Seven.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KAJADA: I know Vantika. I've learned to think as he
thinks. <br>
BASHIR: Kajada, our best evidence suggests Vantika stopped thinking two
days ago. <br>
KAJADA: He's alive. And he's on board this station. And his first
thought when he came on board was to plan a way to access your security
files on the deuridium shipment, which is exactly what he's done. <br>
PRIMMIN: Even if he was alive, it doesn't make sense that he would
purge an entire computer memory to go after a single file. <br>
ODO: It makes perfect sense. Try to access the single file and you'd be
stopped by a dozen different lock outs that I put in to protect it. <br>
KAJADA: But you would never consider locking out the active memory of
your entire system. <br>
KIRA: It would make it impossible to use the computers at all. <br>
KAJADA: So that's where you're vulnerable. <br>
DAX: But how would he gain access? <br>
KAJADA: In the past, he's used a subspace shunt. It would be attached
to a secondary system, something that runs through the entire facility
but isn't covered by security. <br>
KIRA: The lighting controls, or the replicators. <br>
DAX: I'm showing an unauthorised tap into the computer system. A
temperature control panel, Level twenty one, section ten. <br>
ODO + PRIMMIN: Security to <br>
ODO: To L twenty one, S ten. We're looking for a subspace crossover
link to the computer system. <br>
SECURITY [OC]: Acknowledged. <br>
KAJADA: Tell them to be careful. Vantika undoubtedly equipped the shunt
with an auto-destruct system. <br>
KIRA: You know that for certain without having to check? <br>
KAJADA: I know Vantika. <br>
SISKO: Miss Kajada, I must admit I'm having a tough time with your
theory. <br>
KAJADA: Then you're making a fatal mistake. <br>
SISKO: Three passengers were on your ship. Two bodies are in our
morgue. Unless the ghost of Vantika is <br>
KAJADA: Don't patronise me, Commander! <br>
SISKO: Isn't it more likely that some accomplice did this? <br>
KAJADA: Rao Vantika is obsessed with his own survival. He's prolonged
his life with the use of drugs, cryogenics, transplants. As a medical
supervisor in a high security penitentiary, he used prisoners for his
illegal experiments in cellular longevity. He's organised raids on
government labs to steal bio-regenerative research. I promise you when
he started that fire on board my ship, he had a plan to survive. I'm
not sure what that plan was, but I'm convinced it succeeded. <br>
SISKO: Doctor, how soon before we get the results of the DNA trace? <br>
BASHIR: I sent it to Starfleet Command yesterday. They'll have to
coordinate with Kobliad security. I'd say another twelve hours. <br>
SISKO: Until then, we will operate under the assumption that Vantika is
alive. <br>
ODO: Commander, may I have a word with you? </font></p>

ODO: Oh, so you already know about this. <br>
SISKO: Yes, Lieutenant Primmin mentioned to me <br>
ODO: You asked me to stay in charge of security when you took command
of this station. I did not ask you. <br>
SISKO: Constable, no one knows this station like you do. <br>
ODO: Yes, I've noticed that. Constable. Very cute. <br>
SISKO: It's an expression of affection. I believe Major Kira was the

ODO: I don't need anyone's affection. I do need clear jurisdiction or I
am out. <br>
SISKO: I like you, Odo. I like to know where a man stands. There's
never been any question of that with you. I need you here. No Starfleet
officer can do the job you do. <br>
ODO: You've got that straight. <br>
SISKO: But you have to realise that Starfleet is not going to take
command of a station in deep space without assigning some security to
protect its interests. <br>
ODO: Understandable. <br>
SISKO: You're going to have to work with Primmin. The two of you have
to find a way to get along. <br>

DAX: Somebody tried to break into the ship's cargo bay. <br>
SISKO: Since it's been docked? <br>
DAX: Kira confirmed that there was no damage to the cargo area when
they brought it in. <br>

BASHIR: The closest thing I've encountered is synaptic pattern
displacement. But that's never been done by a non-Vulcan. <br>
DAX: I'm convinced Vantika was working on it. There are over seventy
different computer simulations in his file. All involve identifying
neural energy patterns and storing them in different areas of the
brain. <br>
BASHIR: There's plenty of room. A humanoid uses only a small portion of
the brain. <br>
DAX: What if another entity shared the unused portion? <br>
BASHIR: Hypothetically, Vantika's consciousness could be occupying
someone else's brain while he waits for the deuridium to arrive. But
whose? Kajada? <br>

reason to believe she'd even be aware of his presence. <br>

else is along for the ride. <br>
SISKO: Would an examination of Kajada confirm any of this? <br>

ODO: I'm sorry. I believe it's necessary at this point to limit access
to the security files to four people. Myself, Lieutenant Primmin, Major
Kira and Commander Sisko. <br>
KAJADA: When is the shipment scheduled to arrive? <br>
ODO: I can't give you that information. <br>
KAJADA: What about this Ferengi, Quark? <br>
ODO: What about him? <br>
KAJADA: From what I understand, he has his hands into everything around
here. Is he under surveillance? <br>
ODO: I always keep an eye on him. <br>
KAJADA: I hope so. Because he's exactly the kind that Vantika would use
in his plans.

QUARK: Everything's been taken care of. <br>
DURG: That's what you said about Vener Seven. <br>
QUARK: You should thank me for Vener Seven. You got paid, didn't you? <br>
DURG: We almost got killed. <br>
QUARK: A normal risk in your line of work. <br>
DURG: It's a normal risk when we work for you, that's for certain. So,
when do we meet this Kobliad? <br>
QUARK: When he decides it's appropriate. <br>
DURG: All right then, a better question. When do we get paid? <br>
QUARK: When the job is completed of course. <br>
DURG: Not acceptable. We'll require an advance payment of seventy
percent. <br>
(Kajada is eavesdropping from the top floor) <br>
QUARK: Durg, wake up. This is Quark you're talking to, remember. <br>
DURG: All past debts have been settled. <br>

jail if I hadn't <br>

BASHIR: Can you speak? <br>
KAJADA: Pushed. Vantika. <br>
BASHIR: I can't keep her conscious any longer, Commander. If she moves
too much, she could suffer permanent paralysis. <br>
SISKO: Did you see anybody behind her? <br>
QUARK: I just heard the scream and looked up. she fell from the
balcony. What was she doing up there anyway? <br>
ODO: She had an odd feeling you might be helping someone hijack this
deuridium shipment. <br>
QUARK: I resent the inference. <br>
ODO: It's not an inference. It's a definite suspicion. <br>
SISKO: Was anyone else in the bar? <br>
QUARK: Anyone else? <br>
SISKO: At the time of the accident. <br>
QUARK: No, just me. Just tidying up, which if you'll excuse me, I
really must finish. <br>
ODO: Not so fast, Quark. I want to take a look at that third floor
before you get rid of all the evidence. <br>
QUARK: Be my guest, but I'm telling you she was alone up there. And she
had no business invading the privacy of a law-abiding member of the
community. <br>
(Quark and Odo leave) <br>
SISKO: What do you think, Doctor? Could this have been a suicide
attempt? <br>
BASHIR: I haven't noticed any indication of suicidal behaviour, but
then, who knows what the effect of sharing one's brain might be? <br>
SISKO: I'd still like some confirmation of that. <br>
BASHIR: I'll have to tend to her injuries before I conduct any brain
scans, but until we find the transfer method Vantika used, I'm not even
sure what to look for. <br>

fingernails. CSI would be proud) <br>
SISKO: Find something under his fingernails? <br>
DAX: Not yet. <br>
SISKO: What are you looking for? <br>
DAX: Confirmation of a theory, I hope. I've been asking myself, why
would anyone induct a bioelectrical charge into a glial cell? <br>
SISKO: A question I have always wondered about. <br>
DAX: Well, it might make sense if you wanted to send a bio-coded
message along the glial cells of someone's nervous system all the way
to the brain. My guess is that's what Vantika was trying to do. <br>
SISKO: Using his fingernails? <br>
DAX: Frankly, I can't think of another way he could have delivered the
bio-coded message. He must have used a very weak electrical charge, or
the sensors on Kajada's ship would have detected it. Ideally, he would
have injected the coded message directly into his victim's skin but
there were no hyposprays or needles anywhere on the ship. <br>
(The virtual positron imaging scan finds something in the
scrapings)&nbsp;<br>
DAX: A microscopic generator. <br>
SISKO: You're suggesting stored his consciousness in that thing? <br>
DAX: His neural patterns encoded as bioelectrical pulses. He could have
placed that device under his nail months ago, just in case he needed an
escape route in an emergency. His last resort before death. <br>
SISKO: Will this show up in Kajada? <br>
DAX: Now that we know what we're looking for, we should be able to
confirm it with a glial scan. <br>
SISKO: Do it as soon as Bashir stabilises her. Nice work.

PRIMMIN: You understood the logic of Vantika's MO when he downloaded
the computer memory. Avoid the single file, attack the system. <br>
ODO: I'm not following. <br>
PRIMMIN: Vantika has to know that all of our security efforts will be
focused on the docking ring. <br>

PRIMMIN: I figured if he holds true to form that's not where he'll try
to hurt us. So I ran a diagnostic of all the systems that could shut
our whole defence array down. <br>

PRIMMIN: I know. I didn't find anything either. But then I went to the
back-up systems and I found a glitch there I couldn't explain. And I
tracked it back to the waste reclamation system where no body would
ever think to look because it's considered non-essential. And I found
this. <br>

SISKO [on viewscreen]: What have you done to his mind, Vantika? <br>
BASHIR: It was necessary to render him unconscious for the time being.
However, I might consider leaving his body and returning him to you.
But first you must release your tractor beam. <br>

PRIMMIN: Negative. Their shields are up. <br>
SISKO: Suggestions? <br>
KIRA: A small ship like a runabout might be able to get close enough to
overload their shield generators with directed phaser fire. We used to
do it to Cardassian freighters all the time. <br>

board <br>

to disrupt Vantika's control over Bashir? <br>

can design an electromagnetic pulse to disrupt those patterns, Julian
might emerge. We still need a way to get it there. <br>
SISKO: Could we run it right along the tractor beam at the same
frequency as their shields? <br>

field inside the ship. <br>
