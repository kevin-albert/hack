ODO: Quark! <br>
QUARK: Not now, Odo. <br>
ODO: We have to talk. <br>
QUARK: It'll have to wait. <br>
ODO: It can't wait. <br>
QUARK: Of course not. Make it fast. I have business to attend to. <br>
ODO: You remember that Subytt freighter we were discussing the other
day? The one you claimed was smuggling defective isolinear rods to
Bajor? <br>
QUARK: Yes, yes, what about it? <br>
ODO: Well, I conducted a little investigation of that freighter, and do
you know what I discovered? <br>
QUARK: That I was telling the truth. <br>
ODO: That's right. I arrested the first officer and two of the crew. <br>
QUARK: Congratulations, Constable, I knew you could do it. Now if you
don't mind, I'm needed upstairs. <br>
ODO: Hold on, I'm not finished with you. <br>
QUARK: Oh, really, Odo? Sometimes I think there's no pleasing you. I
help you crack a notorious smuggling ring, yet you still insist on
treating me like the enemy. <br>
ODO: You are the enemy. <br>
QUARK: Then how do you explain my helping you? <br>
ODO: That's just it. I can't explain it. <br>
QUARK: It's simple, really. I figured we'd been at each others' throats
long enough. It's time we called a truce. <br>
ODO: Truce? You must be joking. <br>
QUARK: Ask the Subytt first officer if I'm joking. From now on, you and
I are going to be friends. <br>
ODO: You're up to something. <br>
QUARK: Why would you say that? <br>
ODO: Because you're always up to something. <br>
QUARK: I can see this is going to take time, but eventually you'll
learn to trust me. <br>
ODO: That'll be the day. <br>
(Odo leaves) <br>
QUARK: I don't think I can remember Odo looking quite so perplexed. <br>
ROM: He's not alone. Those Subytt smugglers were a potential source of
great profit. <br>
QUARK: Must I quote you the seventy-sixth Rule of Acquisition? <br>
ROM: The seventy-sixth rule? <br>
QUARK: Every once in a while, declare peace. It confuses the hell out
of your enemies. <br>
(On the stairs, Quark is stopped by a purple haired lady alien in a
closefitting catsuit.) <br>
CAPTAIN: Hi, Quark. How are your lobes? <br>
QUARK: Tingling at the sight of you. What'll it be? Another Black Hole?
<br>
CAPTAIN: No, I don't have time. My ship's about to pull out. Do you
know of anyone going to Bajor? <br>
QUARK: Ships go back and forth from there all the time. Why? <br>
(The Captain holds up an elaborate Bajoran earring.) <br>
CAPTAIN: I promised someone I'd deliver this for them. Doesn't looks
like I'm going to get there this trip. <br>
QUARK: It's an earring. <br>
CAPTAIN: I know it's an earring. It was given to me by a maintenance
worker on Cardassia Four. <br>
QUARK: Are you saying a Cardassian gave you a Bajoran earring? <br>
CAPTAIN: He asked me to take it to Bajor. Said whoever I showed it to
would understand. <br>
QUARK: He said that? <br>
CAPTAIN: Well, this is a Bajoran station, right? There must be someone
here who would know what to do with it. <br>
QUARK: Oh, there is. <br>
CAPTAIN: Who? <br>
QUARK: Me. <br>

the doorbell rings.) <br>
KIRA: Come in. <br>
QUARK: Surprise. <br>
KIRA: What do you want? <br>
QUARK: I always wondered what your quarters looked like. <br>
KIRA: That better not be your only reason for being here. <br>
QUARK: You don't entertain much, do you? <br>
KIRA: I entertain a lot. I just don't entertain you. <br>
QUARK: Let me guess, the bedroom. <br>
KIRA: You take one step in here and I promise you it'll be your last. <br>
QUARK: It could be worth it. <br>
KIRA: You have five seconds to tell me what you want. <br>
QUARK: Aren't you going to offer me a beverage? <br>
KIRA: Five, four <br>
QUARK: Can we at least sit down? <br>
KIRA: Three two one. <br>
QUARK: Wait. I brought you something. <br>
(He holds out the earring.) <br>
KIRA: Where did you get this? <br>
QUARK: Is it valuable? <br>
KIRA: I said, where did you get it? <br>
QUARK: From a Boslic freighter Captain. She got it from a Cardassian. <br>
KIRA: Where? <br>
QUARK: On Cardassia Four. That's what she told me, anyway. <br>
(Kira leaves with the earring) <br>

(Jakes hurries down the stairs) <br>
JAKE: You got a minute? <br>
SISKO: For you, absolutely. <br>
JAKE: I've got some great news. <br>
SISKO: You passed your algebra test. <br>
JAKE: Better than that. <br>
SISKO: You learned out how to hit <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/g/gibsobo01.shtml" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Bob
Gibson</a>'s fast ball. <br>
JAKE: No, even better. <br>
SISKO: Better than hitting Gibson's fast ball? This I want to hear. <br>
JAKE: You remember that Bajoran girl I told you about? <br>
SISKO: The one with the beautiful smile? <br>
JAKE: That's right, Laira. I decided to ask her out. <br>
SISKO: Well good for you. And now you've come to the old man for advice
on what to say to her. <br>
JAKE: Dad, I <br>
SISKO: The main thing is you can't be afraid of rejection <br>
JAKE: Dad, I already asked her out. And she said yes. <br>
SISKO: She did? That's wonderful. <br>
JAKE: I was just wondering if you had any ideas what we could do. I was
thinking of taking her to the holosuites. <br>
SISKO: The holosuites? I don't think so. <br>
JAKE: Why not? <br>
SISKO: Because you're too young to take a girl to the holosuites. <br>
JAKE: Okay, then how about if I bring her to our quarters? <br>
SISKO: No, no, no, no, no, no quarters. <br>
JAKE: We're just going to talk. <br>
SISKO: Talk in public. <br>
JAKE: It's not the same. <br>
SISKO: You want to talk? Take her upstairs. And that way you can talk
and watch the ships go through the wormhole. <br>
JAKE: That's boring. <br>
SISKO: Since when? <br>
JAKE: Since I started going out with girls. <br>
SISKO: This is your first date. <br>
JAKE: And I don't want it to be my last. <br>
KIRA: Commander. I need to speak with you. <br>
SISKO: One moment, Major. <br>
JAKE: I can see you're not ready to have this conversation yet. <br>
SISKO: I'm not ready? <br>
JAKE: I'll just have to come up with a few ideas on my own. Really,
don't worry about it. <br>
SISKO: Who's worried? <br>
(Jake leaves) <br>
KIRA: Commander? <br>
SISKO: Join me, Major.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: One Raktajino with a jacarine peel. <br>
KIRA: Nothing for me. <br>
SISKO: One icoberry torte. So, Major, what can I do for you? <br>
KIRA: I need to borrow a runabout. <br>
SISKO: For what? <br>
KIRA: You really don't want to ask me that. <br>
SISKO: It's too late. I already asked. <br>
KIRA: You don't want to know the answer. <br>
SISKO: Major, I can't loan you a Starfleet runabout without knowing
where you plan on taking it. <br>
KIRA: To Cardassia Four to rescue a Bajoran prisoner of war. <br>
SISKO: You're right. I wish you hadn't told me. <br>
KIRA: This earring was recently smuggled off the planet. Do you see
this? That is the insignia of Li Nalas. <br>
SISKO: The resistance leader? <br>
KIRA: The greatest we ever had. His victory over Gul Zarale in
hand-to-hand combat <br>
SISKO: Major, I have already heard the story. Wasn't he reported killed
in action? <br>
KIRA: His body was never found. Look, Commander, I wouldn't be asking
this if I thought there was another way to rescue Li. But Bajoran ships
don't have the manoeuvrability or defensive capabilities to get me
safely in and out of Cardassian territory. <br>
SISKO: You're sure this is genuine? <br>
KIRA: Dax found dermal residue on the back. A genetic analysis matched
it to Li's DNA records. It's genuine all right. <br>
SISKO: Have you told the provisional government? <br>
KIRA: I contacted three ministers. Their response was exactly what I
expected. <br>
SISKO: In other words, they're unwilling to risk going to war with
Cardassia over an earring. I can't say I blame them. <br>
KIRA: Commander, you and I both know the provisional government is made
up of political opportunists too busy fighting among themselves to care
what happens to Bajor. Since the loss of the Kai, the situation has
only gone from bad to worse. There are reports of factional fighting in
half a dozen districts, religious riots have spread throughout the
southern islands. Bajor needs a leader. Someone the people will listen
to. Someone they can trust. <br>
SISKO: And you think Li Nalas is that leader? <br>
KIRA: I know he is. <br>
O'BRIEN [OC]: O'Brien to Sisko. <br>
SISKO: Go ahead, Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN [OC]: I think you and Odo had better join me in the habitat
ring. Level thirteen, section four. There's something you should see. <br>
SISKO: We'll be right there. <br>
KIRA: Do I get the runabout? <br>
SISKO: I'll have to think it over.

to do some repair work on the field modulators when I noticed this. <br>
(Spray paint graffiti on the wall in vivid yellow) <br>
SISKO: It's the emblem of the Alliance for Global Unity. They call
themselves The Circle. <br>
O'BRIEN: The Circle, huh. What gives them the right to mess up our
station? <br>
ODO: They're an extremist faction who believe in Bajor for the
Bajorans. All other species are inferior and should be expelled from
the planet. <br>
SISKO: I understand this emblem has appeared all over Bajor. <br>
ODO: That's correct. But this is the first time I've seen it here. <br>
SISKO: I want to be informed immediately if this emblem appears
anyplace else on the station. <br>
ODO: Understood. <br>
O'BRIEN: If they think scrawling a few of signs is going to get rid of
us, they've got another think coming. <br>
SISKO: Right now they're just trying us show us we're vulnerable. <br>
ODO: I wouldn't be overly concerned, Commander. This section is a low
security area. <br>
SISKO: As of now, Constable, there are no low security areas on this
station.

DAX: You wanted to see me, Benjamin? <br>
SISKO: Ah, yes. Have a seat. <br>
(Throws the ball to her) <br>
DAX: Am I to assume this is going to be about baseball? <br>
SISKO: Not this time. <br>
DAX: Good. <br>
SISKO: I thought you enjoyed talking about baseball. <br>
DAX: Curzon enjoyed it, but not half as much as he led you to believe.
So what's on your mind, Benjamin. <br>
SISKO: I've been thinking about our mission here. I look at the turmoil
on Bajor and I see everything we fought for this past year starting to
unravel. <br>
DAX: I told you this was going to be a tough assignment when we came
here. Of course, I didn't realise it was going to be this tough. <br>
SISKO: What if I told you I knew someone who could bring stability to
Bajor. Someone who could unite the factions and give us a chance to do
our job. <br>
DAX: I'd say give Kira the runabout. <br>
SISKO: How do you know about Kira wanting a runabout? <br>
DAX: I promised not to tell. <br>
SISKO: Supposing I do help, and she does rescue Li Nalas. What do we
say to the Cardassians? <br>
DAX: The question is, what do they say to us? They swore they released
all their Bajoran prisoners. </font></p>

O'BRIEN: Oh, so she's going to Cardassia Four after all. <br>
SISKO: Is there anyone on this station she didn't tell? <br>
O'BRIEN: I doubt she mentioned it to Quark. <br>
SISKO: Well then, as far as Quark's concerned, she's going to Lamenda
Prime to bring back mineral samples. <br>
O'BRIEN: I see. <br>
SISKO: Now, is there any way we can prevent the Cardassian sensors from
picking up the runabout's signature? <br>
O'BRIEN: I could modulate the engine's power emissions, reconfigure the
deflector shield grid, and install field buffers around the subspace
emitter coil. By the time I'm done, the Cardassians will think they're
reading a Lissepian transport. <br>
SISKO: Yeah. I see you've already given this a bit of thought. <br>

O'Brien will be accompanying you on your mission. <br>
KIRA: I don't think that's a good idea. Having a Federation officer
along could cause complications for you later. <br>
SISKO: I'm willing to risk that. You're an excellent pilot, Major, but
Mister O'Brien here is better. And I want to make sure that I get my
runabout back in one piece. <br>
KIRA: I appreciate the offer, but this is a Bajoran problem. <br>
SISKO: I don't agree. The truth is, I need Li Nalas back on Bajor as
much as you do. <br>
O'BRIEN: Besides, I've seen how the Cardassians treat their prisoners.
No one should have to suffer like that. <br>
KIRA: If the Cardassians get their hands on us, we'll be the ones
suffering. <br>

KIRA: Before we go, there's one thing we need to clear up between us. <br>
O'BRIEN: And what would that be? <br>
KIRA: This mission can end only one of two ways. Either we bring back
Li Nalas or we don't come back at all. <br>

O'BRIEN: Can you get a fix on the source? <br>
KIRA: It's position is holding steady at bearing two one nine mark two
three. <br>
O'BRIEN: It must be a navigational control post. It's probably just a
routine scan. <br>
KIRA: We're being hailed. <br>
O'BRIEN: Then again, we could be in serious trouble. <br>
KIRA: They're repeating the hail. <br>
O'BRIEN: We're on the edge of their scanner range. That puts us out of
visual contact. I say we try and bluff them. <br>
KIRA: Opening a channel. <br>
CARDASSIAN [OC]: This is Cardassian navigational control post twenty
four. Identify yourself. <br>
KIRA: This is the Lissepian transport Martuk. <br>
CARDASSIAN [OC]: According to our scan, your subspace field emitters
appear to be malfunctioning. <br>
O'BRIEN: The field buffers must be distorting our power signature. <br>
KIRA: We've been having trouble with our phase modulators. We're
attempting to correct the problem. <br>
CARDASSIAN [OC]: Do you require assistance? We can dispatch a repair
ship. <br>
O'BRIEN: They want to help us? <br>
KIRA: Your offer is most appreciated, post twenty four, but
unnecessary. <br>
CARDASSIAN [OC]: Are you certain? Your power signature is still
fluctuating. <br>
KIRA: He's getting suspicious. I believe we can correct the problem on
our own. Besides, Gul Marayn is waiting on Cardassia Four to receive my
shipment of Rulot seeds. Any delay could ruin the entire crop, not to
mention the Gul's mood. <br>
CARDASSIAN [OC]: Understood. You can put in for repairs after you
deliver your cargo. <br>
KIRA: My plan exactly. He's cut off their transmission. <br>
O'BRIEN: Tell me, Major, who is this Gul Marayn. <br>
KIRA: Don't ask me. I just made him up. <br>
(They arrive at the orange planet) <br>
O'BRIEN: We're in synchronous orbit above the Hutet Labour camp. I've
limited the bioscans to detect only Bajoran lifeforms. Hold on. We're
getting multiple readings. There must be about a dozen Bajoran
prisoners down there. <br>
KIRA: What? Is there any way of beaming up more than two at a time? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm afraid not. As soon as we beam the first two up, all hell
is going to break loose in that camp. <br>
KIRA: And there's no way of guaranteeing Li will be one of the first
two. What's security like down there? <br>
O'BRIEN: The compound is surrounded by a standard Cardassian
forcefield. <br>
KIRA: We're going to have to land. It's our only chance of getting them
all out of there. <br>

of Bajor. <br>
KIRA: An apology? <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: We had no idea that Bajoran prisoners were still
being held on Cardassia Four. Such detentions are a direct violation of
supreme directive twenty six forty five, and I assure you the camp
Prefect will be chastised accordingly. <br>
KIRA: What about the prisoners that were left behind? <br>
DUKAT [on monitor]: They are already en route to Bajor. <br>
KIRA: Well, I look forward to their safe return. <br>
DUKAT: I'm sure you do. And I hope our quick response to this
unfortunate situation will prove once and for all that Cardassia is no
longer your enemy. <br>
(transmission ends) <br>
KIRA: Commander? <br>
SISKO: I'm as surprised as you are. <br>
KIRA: There's got be a reason why they're being so accommodating. <br>
SISKO: I'm sure there is, but until we can figure out their motives,
let's just be grateful that all the prisoners are being returned
safely. Congratulations on the success of your mission, Major.

KIRA: I'm not surprised. All I did was risk my life. <br>
JARO: What you did, Major, was declare war on Cardassia. Thankfully
they declined the invitation. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: The Nanut isn't scheduled to return from the

LI: Actually I planned on staying there considerably longer. <br>
SISKO: I don't follow. <br>
LI: Commander, I'm going to tell you a story. You may even believe it. <br>
SISKO: I'm listening. <br>
LI: During the occupation I was a member of a minor resistance cell,
the name is unimportant. One day, this was in the mountains surrounding
the Sahving valley, we were ambushed by Cardassian troops. Only three
of us managed to escape. We hid in the hills for two days. Finally the
lack of food and water forced us down into the valley. We made our way
to a ridge overlooking a small lake. As I was the only one still
carrying a phaser, I went ahead to scout for the enemy. Halfway down
the embankment, I slipped and went sprawling on my back down to the
edge of the lake just as a huge Cardassian emerged from the water. He
must have just finished bathing. He stood there, frozen in surprise,
dressed only in his underwear, shivering from the cold. I lay there
looking up at him too stunned to even move, and it was only when he
reached for a phaser rifle that was lying across his clothes on a
nearby rock that I realised I was still holding my own phaser, and I
shot him. His body fell on top of me, and that's how my companions
found us a moment later. One of them recognised him as Gul Zarale,
responsible for the massacre of half a dozen Bajoran villages. Now I
tried to tell them what happened, but they had already convinced
themselves that I had killed Zarale in some kind of savage struggle,
which is what they insisted on telling every Bajoran that we met. And
no matter how hard I tried to deny it, the story continued to spread
until it seemed all of Bajor had heard it. Soon every victory won by
the resistance was attributed to my leadership. Stories of my
brilliance, my daring, my courage grew more and more unbelievable, yet
the people insisted on believing them. My reputation even followed me
into the labour camp where my mere presence seemed to inspire my fellow
prisoners. And I had done nothing but shoot an unarmed Cardassian in
his underwear. I'll never forget the look on his face as he died. He
was so embarrassed. So you see, Commander, I have done what Bajor
needed me to do. I have allowed myself to be a slave to my reputation
all of these years, and now it is enough. <br>
SISKO: They still need you. <br>
LI: But I am not the man that they think I am. <br>
SISKO: Perhaps not. But Bajor doesn't need a man. It needs a symbol,
and that's what you are. No one's asking you to lead troops into
battle, or to kill a hundred Cardassians with your bare hands. I saw
you in front of the crowd on the Promenade. They look at you and they
see strength, and honour, and decency. They look at you and they see
the best in themselves. <br>
LI: But it's all based on a lie. <br>
SISKO: No. It's based on a legend. And legends are as powerful as any
truth. Bajor still needs that legend. It needs you.
