O'BRIEN: That you were, Cadet. <br>

thought. The entire plasma distribution manifold is shot. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Can you replicate a new one? <br>
O'BRIEN: No. Cardassian manifolds use a beta-matrix compositor which
can't be replicated. <br>
ODO: I suppose we could contact Gul Dukat and ask if he has any spare
manifold systems lying around. <br>
SISKO: I'm sure he'd jump at the chance to help us. Any other ideas? <br>
O'BRIEN: We could send a salvage team to the abandoned Cardassian
station in the Trivas System. <br>
SISKO: Empok Nor? <br>
O'BRIEN: It's the same design as this station. The Cardassians pulled
out about a year ago, but there's a good chance that the plasma
manifold system is still operational. <br>
SISKO: What about Dominion activity in the area? <br>
O'BRIEN: There hasn't been any for several months. Strategically, they
seem to have lost interest in that sector. <br>
ODO: But there is one problem. It's standard Cardassian procedure to
booby-trap a facility before abandoning it, and a lot of the surprises
they leave behind are specifically keyed to attack non-Cardassians. <br>
SISKO: Sounds like you should take a Cardassian along. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Airlock]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: So what did Captain Sisko do to persuade
you to come along? <br>
GARAK: How do you know I didn't volunteer? <br>
O'BRIEN: He threatened you, didn't he? <br>
GARAK: Nothing so coarse. The Captain bribed me. He offered to help me
procure a larger space for my workshop. The latest dressmaking
equipment is surprisingly bulky. </font></p>

here. What's the matter? <br>
GARAK: It's just that lately I've noticed that everyone seems to trust
me. It's quite unnerving. I'm still trying to get used to it. Next
thing I know, people are going to be inviting me to their homes for
dinner. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I promise I will never
have you over. <br>
GARAK: I appreciate that, Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: Don't mention it. Anything to return the favour. Disarming
Cardassian booby traps
is my least favourite kind of engineering. <br>
GARAK: I can certainly understand that, but don't worry. I have some
experience in that area. </font></p>

you talk me into volunteering for this. <br>
PECHETTI: Well, it beats working on the waste extraction system.
Besides, how often does an engineer get to wear a phaser? <br>
STOLZOFF: (Female security) Hate to disappoint you, Pechetti. But the
only thing you'll be using that for is shooting voles. Empok Nor's been
abandoned so long, they're going to be hungry. <br>
AMARO: (Male security) Don't worry, you play with your wrenches, we'll
watch your back. </font></p>

NOG: I'm reporting for duty, sir. <br>
O'BRIEN: Welcome aboard, Cadet. <br>
NOG: Thank you, sir. And may I say it's a privilege to be here, sir. <br>
O'BRIEN: You've earned it. But one more sir and I'll leave you behind. <br>
NOG: Very well, s. Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: Let's get going. Next stop, Empok Nor. <br>
(Later, en route. Garak and Nog are playing a board game. Boq'ta is at
helm.) <br>
GARAK: What are you doing? <br>
NOG: Regrouping. <br>
GARAK: But you're losing. <br>
NOG: That's why I have to protect my assets. <br>
GARAK: This is not a financial transaction. Protecting your assets is
what got you into trouble in the first place. You have to go on the
offensive. You have to attack. <br>
NOG: Your move. <br>
GARAK: This is maddening. Asking a Ferengi to play a Cardassian game is
like asking a Klingon to chew with his mouth closed. Kotra is not about
regrouping or hoarding assets. It's about bold strategy and decisive
action. Chief, would you like to take on the winner? I'd love to play
Kotra against the hero of Setlik Three. <br>
O'BRIEN: What is that supposed to mean? <br>
GARAK: Oh, we all know your distinguished war record. How you led two
dozen men against the Barrica encampment and took out an entire
regiment of Cardassians. If you play Kotra with half that brazenness,
we'd have quite a match. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm not a soldier anymore. I'm an engineer. <br>
GARAK: I see. So when you and Doctor Bashir go into the holosuites for
hours at a time you're just repairing them? <br>
O'BRIEN: What's your point, Garak? <br>
GARAK: I'm just curious. Why do you and Doctor Bashir spend hours in
the holosuites dressed as fighter pilots, reliving ancient battles? <br>
O'BRIEN: We do it for fun. It's a game. <br>
GARAK: So is Kotra. And I'd love nothing more than to play against a
man like you. <br>
O'BRIEN: Maybe some other time. <br>
PECHETTI: Chief, here's the wish list you wanted. Three categories.
Must Have, which includes the manifolds and the plasma recoilers. Could
Use, things like EPS matrix converters and Would be Nice. Bypass
displacers, polarity maximisers, that sort of thing. <br>
O'BRIEN: Cardassian emblems and insignias? <br>
PECHETTI: A low priority, but if we happen to find some. <br>
O'BRIEN: This is a salvage operation, Pechetti, not an opportunity to
indulge your collecting obsession. <br>
PECHETTI: Right. <br>
(Later still. Now Nog is at helm.) <br>
NOG: Approaching Empok Nor, sir. <br>
O'BRIEN: Take us out of warp. Run a full scan. I'll take the helm. <br>
NOG: The station's main power supply and life support systems are
offline. No lifesigns. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll take us into transporter range. <br>
GARAK: Oh, I don't think we can risk beaming aboard. There are probably
pattern scramblers rigged to go off if they detect a non-Cardassian
transporter signal. <br>
O'BRIEN: That could be messy. We'll have to dock. Landing pads are
sealed. We'll have to try an upper pylon. <br>
NOG: Won't the airlock have booby-traps? <br>
GARAK: You can count on it. And someone's going to have to disarm them
before we dock. <br>
NOG: I volunteer, sir. <br>
GARAK: The scanner in the airlock might mistake your enthusiasm as
Cardassian, but not your DNA. No, I'm afraid I'm the only one who as a
chance of getting through.

PECHETTI: If you're telling me that there are two Cardassian soldiers
from the Third Battalion loose on this station, we're in trouble. Death
to All. That was their motto. <br>
GARAK: Three simple words, and they certainly sum up their credo
nicely. <br>
NOG: Why would the Cardassians abandon the station and leave behind a
few soldiers in stasis tubes? <br>
STOLZOFF: Why do you think? To guard it. The tubes were probably rigged
to wake them up as soon as someone came aboard. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's possible, but one thing's for sure. They're out there
somewhere, and considering what they did to the runabout, I don't think
they're too friendly. <br>
STOLZOFF: Maybe they're upset because we haven't introduced ourselves. <br>
AMARO: We should find them, say hello. (tricorder) This thing's not
working. <br>
O'BRIEN: Neither's mine. They must've set up a dampening field. <br>
BOQ'TA: We've got to get out of here. Let's call for help. <br>
PECHETTI: How? The station's subspace transceiver was ripped out when
the Cardassians evacuated. <br>
AMARO: Well, we could always try sending smoke signals. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's not a bad idea. The deflector grid is still relatively
intact. If we could modify the field coils to emit a series of
covariant pulses. <br>
PECHETTI: We could use the station like an old-fashioned telegraph and
tap out an SOS. <br>
O'BRIEN: For the pulses to be strong enough to reach Deep Space Nine,
we'd have to boost power to the induction grid. Pechetti, you go down
to the Habitat ring and bring the microfusion reactor back online.
Stolzoff, you go with him. Boq'ta, realign the magnetic flow field in
conduit G-four. Amaro will watch your back. Nog and Garak, you're with
me. We'll set up the signal generator in cargo bay four. <br>

our Cardassian friends. Why would anyone voluntarily seal themselves
into a stasis tube, perhaps for years, just to guard an abandoned
station? Even the Third Battalion isn't that fanatical. Something else
is going on. <br>
O'BRIEN: Maybe so, but I don't intend to be here long enough to find
out what it is. <br>
GARAK: That's the trouble with humans. You don't know how to appreciate
a good mystery. <br>
O'BRIEN: I love a good mystery, the kind I can read in bed, not the
kind that's trying to kill me. <br>
GARAK: Don't get me wrong, Chief. I want to get off this station as
much as you do, but I just know if I don't figure this
out it's going to nag at me for days. <br>
(Meanwhile Nog is sweeping the bay, rifle ready, whilst a Cardassian is
sneaking up behind him.) <br>

modulator so we can get out of here. You have the whole trip home to
sort out the mystery. Nog? I need your help with the phase

let him try. He'll be doing us all a favour. <br>

O'BRIEN: Where did you get this? <br>
GARAK: From its former owner. <br>
NOG: You killed one of the soldiers? <br>
GARAK: One down, one to go. By the way, I took a tissue sample from the
soldier's body. The analysis was rather fascinating, in a grim sort of
way. It seems the unfortunate soul had been given a massive dose of
psychotropic drugs. <br>
O'BRIEN: Why? <br>
GARAK: I'm not sure, but I can tell you one thing. It wasn't to make
him amicable. The drug's protein structure seems designed to amplify my
people's xenophobic tendencies. My guess is that the soldiers that were
left here were part of a Cardassian military experiment. The High
Command was probably looking for a way to further motivate their
troops. <br>
O'BRIEN: So they gave them a drug to make them hate anybody but
Cardassians? <br>
NOG: Then why did they attack you? <br>
GARAK: That's a good question. <br>

left in stasis. They were uncontrollable. <br>

GARAK: I'm not a tailor. Not for the moment, anyway.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOQ'TA: You know, I once bought a suit from Garak.
Turns out the sleeve was a little long. I remember being angry when I
brought it in to be fixed. <br>
AMARO: Is there a point to this story? <br>
BOQ'TA: If I had known he was so dangerous, I never would've
complained. You think he'll get the other Cardassian? <br>
AMARO: I hope not. I want to get him myself. <br>
BOQ'TA: I don't blame you. <br>
(Garak is watching them.) <br>
AMARO: Stolzoff was my friend. We were at the Academy together. <br>
(Garak spots the second soldier and slides into the shadows) <br>
AMARO: She was my sparring partner. The first time we faced off I
remember thinking I ought to take it easy on her. She ended up taking
me down so hard it knocked the wind out of me. That was the last time I
ever pulled a punch with her. She had this one two combination, a feint
to the right and a chop to the neck, faked me out every time. If that
spoonhead gives me the chance, I'll just try it out on him. I think
Stolzoff would have liked that.&nbsp;<br>
BOQ'TA: I can't get this loose. Give me the coil spanner, would you? <br>
(Amaro puts down his rifle and rummages in the tool box.) <br>
AMARO: What does it look like? <br>
BOQ'TA: It's got two pointy things on the end. <br>
(Boq'ta screams. Amaro turns and hears a crack as the soldier breaks
Boq'ta's neck. Then Garak shoots the soldier in the back.) <br>
AMARO: He asked me to get a coil spanner for him. I just turned my back
for a second. <br>
GARAK: That's a shame. And the worst part of it is, this isn't a coil
spanner. <br>
(Garak stabs Amaro with it.) <br>
GARAK: It's a flux coupler. <br>
(And he slides off into the shadows.)

side. <br>
O'BRIEN: Not anymore. The psychotropic drug. He must've been exposed to
it. It's the only explanation. I should've seen it earlier. The way he
accused Amaro of wanting to kill him. The way he insisted on going
after those Cardassians. <br>
NOG: He's coming after us, isn't he? <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes. <br>
NOG: Maybe we can reason with him. Get him to try to understand that
the drug is affecting him. <br>
O'BRIEN: You saw what he did to Amaro and the others. He's not going to
listen to us. <br>
NOG: Then we have to finish setting up the deflector grid. We've got to
get a distress signal out. <br>
O'BRIEN: Garak knows what we've been trying to do. He'll stop us. <br>
NOG: Don't we have to try? <br>
O'BRIEN: Forget it! I've already lost four crewmen trying to send out
that bloody signal. Garak was right. We should've gone after those
Cardassians as soon as they attacked us. You don't wait for the enemy
to come to you, you go to him. Come on. We're going after Garak. <br>
NOG: You mean, to kill him? <br>
O'BRIEN: If that's what it takes to stop him, yes.
