		     </font><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">(A monochrome cloudless Earth hangs in
black space. Welcome to a classic 1930s Flash Gordon style black and
white cinema serial.)<br>CHAOTICA [OC]: Citizens of Earth! Your destiny is in my hands. Those of you who acquiesce 
		     to my demands will be treated fairly. Oppose me, and you face a dire fate 
		     indeed as my slaves in the mines of Mercury! You have one hour. <br>(The suave villan in his mandarin costume has a young man and a young woman tied to chairs.)<br>KIM: You'll never get away with this. <br>
		CHAOTICA: Oh, but I shall. Your once proud country will fall to its knees. 
		How ironic that I am using your rocket ship to lead my space force into battle!.<br>
		KIM: You're wrong, Chaotica. Before you came on board, someone pushed the 
		self-destruct button. In three minutes, we'll all be dead. <br>
		CHAOTICA: No! <br>(Enter our hero, with back pack and ray gun.)<br>PARIS: The jig is up, your Majesty. <br>
		CHAOTICA: Captain Proton. <br>
		PARIS: Spaceman First Class, Protector of Earth, scourge of intergalactic evil, at your service.  <br>
		CHAOTICA: But I saw you fall into the fiery mouth of that volcano. <br>
		PARIS: It takes more than a little lava to stop Captain Proton. Now, 
		I want you to call off your invasion and give me back my rocket ship. <br>(He frees Kim and the girl.)<br>
		CHAOTICA: There is one force in this universe that even you cannot defeat. <br>(The girl screams. The Doctor enters, the only person in colour.)<br>
		EMH: The same to you. <br>
		PARIS: Doc. <br>
		EMH: Mister Paris. I should have known it was you monopolising the holodeck. <br>
		CHAOTICA: Who is this insolent fool? <br>
		KIM: He's one of our men. Computer, adjust the Doctor's spectral frequency. <br>(The Doctor becomes monochrome.)<br>
		EMH: I have no interest in your frivolous fantasy. I'm here to rehearse a 
		duet from Don Carlo and you've already gone three minutes into my scheduled <br>
		CHAOTICA: Enough! Robot, attack! <br>(The girl screams again. The Robot is a far cry from Robbie.)<br>CHAOTICA: Destroy them. Start with him. <br>
		EMH: Computer, freeze programme. <br> 
		PARIS: Doc, this is the final chapter. Satan's Robot Conquers the World. We can't stop now. <br>
		EMH: Does the phrase to be continued mean anything to you? <br>
		PARIS: Your opera can wait. <br>
		EMH: This programme is a waste of photonic energy. <br>
		PARIS: Oh, really. Take a look around you. This is how the twentieth century saw the future. We are studying sociology. <br>
		EMH: Perhaps you can teach a course at Starfleet Academy. Satan's Robot - an Historical Overview. <br>(Paris and the EMH squabble over the holodeck controls until they start to burn.)<br>

		</font></p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">		CHAKOTAY: Bridge to holodeck one. What's going on down there? <br>
		KIM [OC]: Oh, nothing, Commander. Just a little power surge. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Says here the hologrid just blew out. <br>
		KIM [OC]: We're fixing it now, sir. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Well, make it quick. The last thing we need is a broken holodeck. <br>(Seven of Nine enters.)<br>CHAKOTAY: Seven, 
		I want good news. That's an order. <br>
		SEVEN: Then I must disobey. I have no good news to report. I've completed an 
		astrometric scan of the entire region. There are no star systems within twenty five hundred light years. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Nothing? <br>
		SEVEN: Nothing. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Why can't we see stars beyond that? <br>
		SEVEN: There are heavy concentrations of theta radiation. It has occluded our sensors.  <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Any other ships out there? <br>
		SEVEN: None. We are alone. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Every sailor's nightmare. <br>
		SEVEN: Commander.?<br>
		CHAKOTAY: It's like being becalmed in the middle of the ocean. 
		If it weren't for sensors we wouldn't even know we were at warp. We've only been 
		crossing this expanse for two months and we're already feeling the strain. How do we last another two years? <br>
		SEVEN: We will adapt. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Easier said than done. <br>
		SEVEN: Shall I inform the Captain of my findings? <br>
		CHAKOTAY: No. I'll tell her.
		</font></p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">		First Officer's log, Stardate 52081.2. It's been fifty three days since we entered this desolate 
		region. If we want to continue our course toward home we have no choice but to 
		cross it. We won't have an opportunity to take on fresh supplies or fuel, so I've 
		ordered all departments to create an energy reserve. We're using power cells to stockpile deuterium.

		</font></p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">		TORRES: This won't be much of a briefing. There's nothing new to report. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Humour me.  <br>
		TORRES: All right, let's see. Warp core's at peak efficiency, just like last week, and the 
		week before that. And my engineering staff is going stir crazy. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Thanks. Ensign. <br>
		KIM: Nada.  <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Can you be more specific? <br>
		KIM: All systems are operating within normal parameters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Anything new on sensors? <br>
		TUVOK: I've detected a sudden increase in theta radiation in the vicinity.  <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Source? <br>
		TUVOK: Unknown. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Could be worth a look. <br>
		PARIS: Finally some excitement. Radiation. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Next piece of business. Crew morale. <br>
		EMH: Deteriorating, obviously. <br>
		NEELIX: I have a few suggestions that might boost people's spirits. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Please. <br>
		NEELIX: Rotate crew assignments. Add variety to the daily routine. I myself wouldn't mind 
		squeezing in a little tactical training. <br>
		TUVOK: Noted. <br>
		NEELIX: And the holodecks have been in high demand. I was thinking we could 
		install a few emitters in Cargo Bay two. Turn it into a third holodeck. <br>
		EMH: Hear, hear. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: See to it, Harry. <br>
		NEELIX: One other item, sir. A point of er, concern among some of the crew. It's, well, it's the 
		Captain. She's been a bit elusive lately. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: What's your point? <br>
		NEELIX: People take comfort in talking to her. When they see that the Captain's happy, they're happy. <br>
		PARIS: Rumour has it she never leaves her quarters. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Captain's privilege. She'll come to the bridge if and when she's needed. <br>
		TORRES: Spare us the protocol, Chakotay. It's pretty odd, you've got to admit it. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: It's her choice. She can run this ship from wherever the hell she wants to. Understood? <br>
		TORRES: Yeah. Sure. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: We're all feeling the pressure, including me. <br>
		KIM: Listen, maybe we've got the wrong attitude. Let's think of this as a two year vacation. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Dismissed.  <br>
		TORRES: That's a great idea, Harry. <br>
		PARIS: Wow, Harry. You're a real genius. How do you come up with these brilliant ideas? <br>
		KIM: You're such an optimistic guy. <br>(Chakotay returns to the bridge, to gaze at a completely black viewscreen.)

		PARIS: Derada is a game of subtlety. <br>
		TORRES: Too subtle for me. <br>
		PARIS: Hmm. I'll bet. <br>
		TORRES: What's that supposed to mean? <br>
		PARIS: Well, if it doesn't involve Klingon pain sticks. <br>
		TORRES: Good night. <br>
		PARIS: There you go, just when I'm winning. Who's predictable? <br>
		TORRES: You don't want to start a fight with me now. Not at three a.m.&nbsp;<br>(Neelix enters.)<br>PARIS: Three in the morning, four in the afternoon. What's the difference? You're angry twenty four hours a day. <br>
		TORRES: Everything is a joke to you. <br>
		NEELIX: Good evening. Or should I say good morning? Guess you couldn't sleep either. <br>
		PARIS: Oh, why sleep when we're having so much fun. <br>
		TORRES: He's joking, Neelix. We're all supposed to laugh. <br>
		NEELIX: I certainly am laughing, on the inside. Smiling, anyway. Let's start a new game. Cards? 
		Maybe a little snack? <br>
		PARIS: No. I have a better idea. Why don't we make a schedule. A fight rotation. 
		We can optimise our resources. I can start one, then you can start one. <br>
		NEELIX: Please. <br>
		TORRES: I am really tired of these games. <br>
		PARIS: Well then, don't play them. <br>

<font face="Arial" size="2">		NEELIX: Some morale officer I turned out to be. <br>
		EMH: I've given you a mild sedative. It should control the urge to hyperventilate, and alleviate some of your anxiety. <br>
		NEELIX: Anxiety? Anxiety's what I feel when I burn a pot roast. This. This is more like. <br>
		EMH: Dizziness? Nausea? Unspeakable dread? <br>
		NEELIX: Yes. <br>
		EMH: Nihiliphobia. the fear of nothingness. 
		Or in layman's terms, the fear of nothingness. If it's any consolation, 
		I can relate to it. I go into a void every time I'm deactivated. Emptiness, complete 
		and utter oblivion. I'll admit it was unsettling at first. The existential horror of it all. <br>
		NEELIX: You're not helping, Doctor. <br>
		EMH: Sorry. My point is, you'll get used to it. <br>

		TUVOK: No. <br>
		SEVEN: Is the Astrometrics lab designated for recreational use? <br>
		TUVOK: I come here to meditate. Needless to say, the view from my quarters has been less than stellar lately. <br>
		SEVEN: Astronomical phenomena help you to focus your mind. <br>
		TUVOK: Yes. I imagine that each star represents a single thought. <br>
		SEVEN: Meditation. It rejuvenates you? <br>
		TUVOK: Indeed it does. <br>
		SEVEN: I suggest you try Borg regeneration. 
		It's much more efficient. A simple cortical implant would be required. <br>
		TUVOK: Another time, perhaps. <br>(The console beeps.) <br>TUVOK: What is it? <br>

<font face="Arial" size="2">(The lighting is low.)<br>CHAKOTAY: It's probably nothing. Just background theta radiation. But it could mean there's someone nearby.<br>
		JANEWAY: Distance? <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Approximately twenty five light years. <br>
		JANEWAY: It's a long shot, but alter course. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Yes, ma'am. <br>
		JANEWAY: If that's all, Commander.<br>
		CHAKOTAY: Actually, I'd like to make a request. I've been saving up my holodeck rations 
		and I've got three full hours coming. Any chance I might persuade you to join me for 
		a few rounds of Velocity? It'll help clear your mind. <br>
		JANEWAY: My mind is perfectly clear.<br>
		CHAKOTAY: And what if I told you I'm not leaving until you join me? <br>
		JANEWAY: I'd say, have a seat, it'll be a while. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Then I'll be blunt. You've picked a bad time to isolate yourself from the crew. 
		This ship needs a Captain, especially now. <br>
		JANEWAY: Would you be satisfied with I'm just catching up on some reading? 
		I'm not sure I understand it myself. It started when we entered this, 
		what does the crew call it? <br>
		CHAKOTAY: The Void. <br>
		JANEWAY: Charming. Oh, what I wouldn't give for a few 
		Borg cubes about now. Anything for a little distraction. Strange as it sounds, 
		I almost long for the days when we were under constant attack. No time to 
		stop and think about how we got stranded in the Delta quadrant. How did we end up here, Chakotay? Answer me. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: We were faced with a difficult choice. We had the means to get home but using 
		it would've put an innocent people at risk, so we decided to stay. <br>
		JANEWAY: No. No, no. I decided to stay. I made that choice for everyone. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: We're alive and well, and we've gathered enough data about this 
		quadrant to keep Starfleet scientists busy for decades. Our mission's been a success. <br>
		JANEWAY: The very same words I've been telling myself for the past four years. But then 
		we hit this Void, and I started to realise how empty those words sound. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Kathryn. <br>
		JANEWAY: I made an error in judgment, Chakotay. It was short-sighted and it 
		was selfish, and now all of us are paying for my  mistake. So if you don't mind, 
		Commander, I'll pass on that little game. And I'll leave shipboard morale in your capable 
		hands. If the crew asks for me, tell them the Captain sends her regards.

		Are you at war with these beings? <br>
		EMCK: None of your concern. <br>
		JANEWAY: Your vessel seems to be leaking large amounts of theta radiation. 
		What kind of transport mission are you on, exactly? <br>
		EMCK: My ship will depart in two hours. Cooperate or stay behind. I won't be coming to your 
		rescue when the creatures return. I'm finished here. <br>(Janeway nods, and Tuvok beams Emck back to his ship.)<br>
		JANEWAY: I think it's time we heard the other side of the story.

		CHAKOTAY: That could explain why they dampened our power. <br>
		EMH: My feelings exactly. From what I can tell this life form 
		may be indigenous to the Void. His physiology has evolved to survive in complete darkness. <br>
		JANEWAY: His condition?<br>
		EMH: Minor injuries. Phaser wounds to the chest and neck. But that's the least of 
		his problems. He's dying, Captain. Every organ is degrading at the cellular level. <br>(Patient biomedical status - cellular degradation 13.47 theta radiation levels 253.47 - 809.47)<br>
		JANEWAY: Theta radiation poisoning. <br>
		EMH: The final stages. My guess is he's been exposed to it over a long period. There's nothing I can do. <br>
		JANEWAY: I'd like a word with him. I'm Kathryn Janeway, captain of this vessel. <br>
		NIGHT ALIEN: You are allied with the Malon. <br>
		JANEWAY: No. We're simply trying to cross this region. We never met the Malon before today. <br>
		NIGHT ALIEN: They will want me. <br>
		JANEWAY: Well, I have no intention of giving you to them. You're not a captive here. Doctor. 
		Are you at war with the Malon? <br>

		NIGHT ALIEN: We were ignorant. We attacked you. Forgive us. <br>
		JANEWAY: Of course. But I need to understand. You say the Malon are killing your people. There must be a reason. <br>
		NIGHT ALIEN: They're poisoning our space. We don't know why. <br>
		EMH: He's in respiratory distress. We need to get him back to his people. They might know how to treat him. <br>
		NIGHT ALIEN: I will show you how. <br>
		JANEWAY: I need a workstation. Route it to the helm. If you enter the coordinates, my pilot will set a course. <br>
		NIGHT ALIEN: I am grateful. <br>
		JANEWAY: Take the bridge. I'll stay here. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: We still don't have a defence against their dampening field. If they decide to attach again. <br>
		JANEWAY: I'm confident they won't. Finally, something to put in my logbook.

		TUVOK: Proceed. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: It's the Captain. As you may have noticed, she's isolated herself from the crew. <br>
		TUVOK: She believes that she made an error in judgment four years ago. That 
		she's responsible for stranding Voyager in the Delta Quadrant. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: She told you? <br>
		TUVOK: No. I've been observing her behaviour for the past four years. Guilt has been her constant companion. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: You've known her longer than anyone. Have you ever seen her like this? <br>
		TUVOK: Only once. It was during her first year as a Commander on the USS Billings. 
		She sent an away team to survey a volcanic moon. Their shuttle was damaged 
		by a magma eruption and three crew members were severely injured. The next day she returned 
		to the moon alone to complete the survey. She wanted the crew to know that their 
		suffering had not been in vain. She could have been killed. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Seeking redemption.<br>
		TUVOK: Precisely. Captain Janeway's methods are unorthodox. It is her strength as a 
		leader, but unfortunately, it is also her greatest weakness.<br>
		CHAKOTAY: Stubborn as a Klingon.<br>
		TUVOK: To put it mildly.<br>

		TORRES: Oh, it's absorbed by a series of radiometric converters. We recycle the energy, use it to 
		power everything from life support to replicators. <br>
		EMCK: We don't have this kind of conversion technology. <br>
		TORRES: Our scans of your freighter show that you have plasma manifolds. The engineering 
		principles are the same. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: We're not saying this won't take some effort. You're looking at several months of retrofitting, 
		depending on the size of your fleet. All the schematics are here, and we'd be willing to work with you, get

		difficult, but progress can also bring new opportunities. Given time, this could turn to your advantage. <br>
		EMCK: I already have the advantage. The vortex. No one knows about it except me and my crew. By ejecting my

		CHAKOTAY: Any chance we could destroy it? <br>
