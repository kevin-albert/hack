and roll music is blaring from a jukebox. Neelix is handing out snacks.) <br>
TORRES: Now, these are delicious. <br>
KIM: Leave some for the rest of us. <br>
TORRES: Hey, I'm eating for two. <br>
PARIS: Great party, Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: Everybody seems to be enjoying it. <br>
PARIS: Yeah, except the Doc. <br>
NEELIX: Those are for eating, not scanning. <br>
EMH: What exactly are they? <br>
NEELIX: Cheese pirogues. Zefram Cochrane's favourite. <br>
EMH: They have absolutely no nutritional value. <br>
NEELIX: This is a party, Doctor. Sometimes you have to forget about
nutrition. <br>
EMH: You could include a vitamin supplement when you replicate them. <br>
NEELIX: Replicate? I made them myself. <br>
JANEWAY: You two have outdone yourselves. I've never seen First Contact
Day celebrated quite like this. When I was your age, all it meant was a
day off from school. <br>
NAOMI: Neelix and I thought we should make it more fun. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, you certainly succeeded. <br>
NAOMI: When is Commander Tuvok making his presentation? <br>
NEELIX: Well, now's as good a time as any. Captain? <br>(Neelix hands Janeway the tray of
snacks.)
<br>NEELIX: May I have everyone's attention, please? In honour of the three hundred
and fifteenth anniversary of his ancestors' arrival on Earth, I've
asked Mister Tuvok to recite the first words spoken to humans by a
Vulcan. Commander. <br>
TUVOK: Is this really necessary? <br>
NEELIX: You promised. <br>
TUVOK: Very well. Live long and prosper. <br>(Applause.)<br>
NEELIX: And now, for some more of Zefram Cochrane's favourite music.
Hey, come on, Mister Vulcan. <br>
TUVOK: Vulcans do not dance. <br>
NEELIX: But it's tradition. <br>
TUVOK: There is no tradition, Mister Neelix. This ceremony is entirely
your invention.<br>
JANEWAY: This is an official ship function, Commander. Don't make me
order you to dance. <br>(Chakotay enters.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Sorry to interrupt, but I've got some interesting news.
Neelix, you might want to hear this. Long range sensors have detected
several hundred lifesigns approximately four point nine light years
away. They're Talaxian. </font></p>

Are we there yet? <br>
JANEWAY: Not exactly. The lifesigns appear to be coming from inside
that asteroid field. <br>
NEELIX: From a ship?<br>
TUVOK: We are not detecting any vessels. <br>
NEELIX: No response from hails? <br>
KIM: Not yet. <br>
NEELIX: I hope they're all right. <br>
CHAKOTAY: There's a lot of interference. Maybe they haven't received
our transmissions. <br>

the Flyer.

It wouldn't have hurt you to do a few steps. <br>
TUVOK: I am trying to concentrate on the shields, Mister Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: I think you were just afraid. <br>
TUVOK: That's absurd. <br>
NEELIX: It's understandable. There were a lot of people watching. <br>
TUVOK: Vulcans don't experience fear. <br>
NEELIX: I'm going to make it my personal mission to get you to dance at
least once before we reach Earth. <br>
TUVOK: Then I suggest you find a more productive hobby. <br>
PARIS: If you two don't stop it, I'm going to come back there and
separate you.<br>
TUVOK: I've localised the lifesigns, bearing one zero eight mark
twenty six. They appear to be inside a large asteroid. <br>
NEELIX: Inside? <br>(Whumph!)<br>NEELIX: What was that? <br>
TUVOK: A thermalyte explosive, thirty point six kilometres to port. I'm
detecting another projectile heading directly toward us. Evasive
manoeuvres. <br>(The projectile hits an asteroid, shattering it.)<br>TUVOK: We've lost shields. <br>
PARIS: Main propulsion is offline. We're going to have to make an
emergency landing. <br>
NEELIX: Where? <br>
PARIS: The Talaxians' asteroid is the closest. <br>
TUVOK: The surface is covered with craters, ice fields. <br>
PARIS: We don't have a choice. Hold on. <br>(The Delta Flyer slides across the asteroid surface before bumping and skidding to a stop.)<br>

Problem?<br>
SEVEN: We've lost contact with the away team. I also detected some
unusual energy discharges in the asteroid field. <br>
JANEWAY: What kind of discharges? <br>
SEVEN: It's difficult to tell because of the interference, but they
appear to be thermalytic explosions. I believe several of them were in
close proximity to the Flyer. <br>
JANEWAY: Source? <br>
SEVEN: Unknown. <br>
JANEWAY: We'll need to send a rescue team. Work with B'Elanna. Try to
modify the shields on one of the shuttles to withstand these

DEXA: If you mean the aliens who were on the ship with you, they're
safe. <br>
NEELIX: I'd like to see them. <br>
DEXA: You need to rest. What were you doing in the asteroid field? <br>
NEELIX: Looking for you. Well, not you specifically. But my ship
detected Talaxians. I haven't come across any in years, so. I'm sorry,
I'm Neelix. <br>
DEXA: Dexa. I had an uncle named Neelix. Are there other Talaxians on
your ship? <br>
NEELIX: I'm the only one. <br>
DEXA: Why are you living with aliens? <br>
NEELIX: They're my friends. Did you receive our hails? <br>
DEXA: Yes. <br>
NEELIX: Why didn't you respond? <br>
DEXA: We avoid contact with outsiders. <br>
NEELIX: We were attacked. There were explosions. Did you? <br>
DEXA: No. We're not violent. <br>
NEELIX: Who fired at us? <br>
DEXA: No one fired at you. There are miners who use explosive charges
to break apart the asteroids so they can collect minerals from the
debris. <br>
NEELIX: I wish we'd known.<br>
DEXA: Why were you carrying weapons? <br>
NEELIX: It's standard procedure for an away mission. Hello. What's your

BRAX: Brax. What's yours? <br>
DEXA: I told you not to come in here. <br>
BRAX: I just want to see him. <br>

JANEWAY: We weren't aware of that. <br>
NOCONA [on viewscreen]: Now you are. <br>
JANEWAY: We lost one of our shuttles inside the field. We're preparing
to send a rescue team. <br>
NOCONA [on viewscreen]: All the resources belong to us. <br>
JANEWAY: We're not interested in the resources. We were only trying to
make contact with the Talaxians. <br>
NOCONA [on viewscreen]: What's your interest in them? <br>
JANEWAY: One of my crewmen is from Talax. He was eager to meet some of
his people. <br>
NOCONA [on viewscreen]: You should have requested permission before
sending in a shuttle. We have a mining operation in progress. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Does that explain the explosions we detected? <br>
NOCONA [on viewscreen]: Mining charges. <br>
JANEWAY: We'd appreciate it if you'd stop using them until we can get
our people out. <br>

conduct a search for your crew. If they need help, we'll provide it. <br>

I don't think you're supposed to be here. <br>
BRAX: This is my home. You can't tell me what to do. <br>
NEELIX: No, of course not. I just don't want you to get in trouble. Is
that a model ship? What's it called? How about The Two-Tailed Talchok?
The Fur Fly? The ship I come from is called Voyager. <br>
BRAX: Is it big? <br>

I'm stuck here. But if your mother would let me out <br>(The sound of a metal door opening.)<br>

DEXA: Neelix, this is Oxilon, our council regent. <br>

exactly the welcome I was expecting. <br>
OXILON: You're free to go now. <br>(He &nbsp;lowers the forcefield.) <br>
NEELIX: What about my friends? <br>
OXILON: We've determined they aren't hostile. They've been treated for
their injuries and asked to leave. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">DEXA: I
know Oxilon seems overly cautious, but we're not used to having
visitors. <br>
NEELIX: How many of you live here? <br>
DEXA: Close to five hundred. All of our homes are connected to the
central cabin by tunnels and lifts. They allow us to easily move from
one section of the asteroid to another. <br>
NEELIX: It must have taken years to build all of this. <br>
DEXA: Almost five. It still isn't finished. <br>
NEELIX: Where did the technology come from? <br>
DEXA: We arrived here with a caravan of six ships. We disassembled all
but one of them and modified their components. We converted torpedo
launchers to blast away rock and excavate these tunnels. These conduits
run into the asteroid's core. We use geothermal energy to melt the ice
that covers most of the outer surface. It provides us with oxygen and
water. <br>
NEELIX: Who'd have imagined all of this inside an asteroid? Your son
seems like a wonderful boy. <br>
DEXA: How would you know? You only met him for a few seconds. <br>
NEELIX: True, but I'm a quick judge of character. <br>
DEXA: He came to see you while I was out, didn't he? <br>
NEELIX: You can't blame him for being curious. <br>

little high. <br>
TUVOK: I regret that you didn't have a more fulfilling experience. <br>
NEELIX: That's nice of you to say, Commander, but it wasn't a complete
waste of time. I got to meet some of my people again, even if it was a

Three days isn't nearly enough time for us to dismantle all our

wait any longer. Demolition of the asteroid is going to start whether
you're here or not. <br>

trouble. <br>
DEXA: And what has running away ever done for us? <br>
OXILON: It's kept us alive. <br>
DEXA: Maybe it's time we stayed and defended ourselves. Will you help
us? <br>
NEELIX: I agree with Oxilon. Fighting isn't the answer. But I'll try to
help. <br>

with the miners, get them to agree to let you stay. <br>

lot of unoccupied territory, but the government restricted us to a very
small area. <br>
NEELIX: Why? <br>
DEXA: They said it was a quarantine to protect the population from
alien diseases. But it was just an excuse. We were outsiders. They
didn't want us mixing with their people. It wasn't long before we
realised we didn't have enough land to grow what we needed to feed
ourselves. Oxilon said we'd just have to conserve our resources. But my
husband was tired of being told what to do, so he started farming
outside the restricted zone. <br>

DEXA: Come on, Brax. We're going home. <br>
BRAX: Why? <br>
DEXA: We have to pack. Come on.<br>
BRAX: You said you were going to help us. <br>
DEXA: Brax.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Astrometrics

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TUVOK:
You wanted to see me. <br>
NEELIX: I've detected five warp capable species within two light years
of the planet where we're taking the Talaxians. I'm worried they might
be vulnerable to attack. <br>
TUVOK: They would be vulnerable anywhere. <br>
NEELIX: I thought maybe you could help me devise some defence
strategies for their new home. <br>
TUVOK: Frankly, Mister Neelix, they don't seem inclined to defend
themselves. <br>
NEELIX: No, I suppose not. <br>
TUVOK: But if they were going to make a stand, their emotional
attachment to their present home might be an asset. <br>
NEELIX: Are you saying they should stay? <br>
TUVOK: I'm speaking hypothetically. <br>
NEELIX: Hypothetically, if they wanted to defend the asteroid, how
would they do it? <br>
TUVOK: To begin with they would need to establish some kind of
perimeter. <br>
NEELIX: You mean shields? <br>
TUVOK: Yes. The miners are monitoring the asteroid. If they detected
the Talaxians erecting a shield, they would attempt to stop them. <br>
NEELIX: I suppose so. <br>
TUVOK: Your people would need competent leadership to defend against a
pre-emptive attack. <br>
NEELIX: If you had the captain's permission, would you be willing to
provide that leadership? <br>
TUVOK: Certainly not. It would be a violation of the Prime Directive.
And even if it weren't, I don't believe that I am the person most
qualified to assume that role. <br>
NEELIX: You mean me? <br>
TUVOK: I am merely speaking hypothetically. <br>
NEELIX: I couldn't lead those people, Mister Tuvok. I'm not a fighter.
I'm just a cook who sometimes imagines himself to be a diplomat. <br>
TUVOK: On the contrary, Mister Neelix. You are much more than that. You
are perhaps the most resourceful individual I have ever known. <br>
NEELIX: I always thought you just tolerated me.<br>
TUVOK: You do have some annoying habits. However, during your time on
Voyager you've developed many valuable skills. Skills that would serve
you well if you ever decided to assume a leadership role. <br>
NEELIX: You really think so? <br>
TUVOK: Let me be clear. I'm not urging you to do anything. I'm simply
telling you that I believe that you are more than capable.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Going somewhere, Mister Neelix? <br>
NEELIX: Just to see my friends. <br>
JANEWAY: Chakotay tells me you're using your own ship. Why not have Tom
take you in the Flyer? <br>
NEELIX: I didn't want to bother anyone. <br>
JANEWAY: You wouldn't be planning anything foolish, would you? <br>
NEELIX: Whatever I do, I promise it won't involve Voyager. <br>
JANEWAY: That wasn't my question. <br>
NEELIX: I know you have Prime Directive issues. But I'm not officially
part of your crew, so I don't have the same constraints. <br>
JANEWAY: You're as much a part of this crew as anyone else. <br>
NEELIX: Are you ordering me not to go? <br>
JANEWAY: That depends on what you're going to do. <br>
NEELIX: It's up to the Talaxians. <br>(Janeway opens the shuttlebay doors.)<br>
JANEWAY: Safe journey, Mister Neelix.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Public area]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Back inside the asteroid, Neelix addresses a crowd.)<br>NEELIX:&nbsp;I know from personal experience that you have
forcefield emitters. We could use them to establish a shield grid.
We'd need to deploy a series of them on the asteroid's surface, along
bisecting diameters. Sixteen emitters should be enough to form a grid. <br>
OXILON: Even if you're right, it'd take weeks to dig that many tunnels
to the surface. <br>
NEELIX: Commander Tuvok suggested that we could modify the emitters so
they could be fired from torpedo tubes on your ship and planted in the
surface. <br>
OXILON: As soon as the miners realised what we were doing, they'd
attack. <br>
NEELIX: I could provide cover from my ship. But you're right, we'd have
to work quickly. <br>
DEXA: We could route power to the emitters directly from the core.
They'd have a permanent energy supply.<br>
NEELIX: Good idea. <br>
OXILON: If we do what you're suggesting, people are going to be hurt. <br>
NEELIX: This is your home. The miners have no right to force you out. <br>
OXILON: I agree. But fighting? <br>
NEELIX: I don't like it either but at some point you have to stand up
for yourselves. How do you know there won't be someone else to
terrorise you the next place you go? <br>
DEXA: You know he's right. <br>
NEELIX: No one has worked harder to build this place than you. Isn't it
worth defending? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Asteroid
control area]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The emitter torpedoes are carried through.)<br>NEELIX:
Wait for my comm. call. As soon as the last emitter's in place, start
routing power to the grid. <br>
DEXA: Understood. <br>
NEELIX: You're scared, aren't you?<br>
DEXA: You? <br>
NEELIX: Terrified. <br>
DEXA: Be careful. <br>
NEELIX: I will. <br>

JANEWAY: It's an idea I'd need to talk to Starfleet Command about. <br>
NEELIX: It must be important. <br>
JANEWAY: It is. Now that we've established two way communication with
Earth, it seems to me Starfleet could use a permanent ambassador in the
Delta Quadrant. This ambassador would have to stay in frequent contact
with Voyager. <br>
NEELIX: Certainly. <br>
