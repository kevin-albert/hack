is the sociopath who killed Crewman Darwin because he didn't like the
way he looked at him. See
<a href="213.htm" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Meld</a> for more
details. He shows Tuvok a seedling in a container.) <br>
SUDER: Look. And you said they were incompatible. <br>
TUVOK: You have confirmed the genetic structure? <br>
SUDER: An entirely new species. I'm going to name it after you. The
Tuvok Orchid. <br>
TUVOK: That is an honour you should reserve for yourself, Mister Suder.
You gave this species life. <br>
SUDER: And you gave me life. All of this is because of you. Because of
the meld. <br>
TUVOK: The meld may have introduced you to my interest in floriculture,
but you have embraced it entirely on your own, and discovered a unique
talent within yourself in the process. <br>
SUDER: I used to think the only talent I had was a talent for killing.
Please. It's my way of saying thank you.<br>
TUVOK: Very well. I accept. <br>
SUDER: Tuvok, I want to do something for the ship. I'm not asking you
to let me out of confinement. I accept my punishment. But if I could
just, just contribute somehow. <br>
TUVOK: What contribution do you feel you could make from your quarters?
<br>
SUDER: I was, I was thinking I might adapt some of the genetic
engineering techniques I've developed for the orchids to make the
airponic vegetable garden more productive. <br>
TUVOK: Your attitude is admirable. I will discuss it with the Captain. <br>
SUDER: Do you think she'll agree? <br>
TUVOK: We'll see. Now, shall we begin? Notice your mind working, how it
plans for the future, visits the past. Notice those thoughts and set
them aside. Turn your attention to the white light that is your breath.

Captain, we're being hailed on a subspace frequency. <br>
JANEWAY: Are there ships in the vicinity? <br>
PARIS: Negative. Tracking the source. Seems like it's coming from an
unmanned buoy, coordinates one four zero mark three one seven. <br>
KIM: It looks like a Kazon signal, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Take us out of warp. Open a channel. <br>
SESKA [on viewscreen]: Chakotay, they're going to take your son. When
Culluh saw the baby. I hear them coming. I don't have much time. When
he saw the baby wasn't his. Please Chakotay, help us. Not for me, for
your son. <br>
(Static on the viewscreen.) <br>
CULLUH [OC]: I told you to stay out of here. <br>
SESKA [OC]: No, please don't. Don't take him! I beg you. No! Please,
no! <br>
CULLUH [OC]: I'm taking him! <br>

This is not my responsibility! She has no right to expect me to <br>
JANEWAY: She knows you, Chakotay. She knew how you'd react when you saw
your son in danger. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I have a duty to this crew. I can't just leave and go looking
for the child. <br>
JANEWAY: And I'd never consider letting you go into a Kazon-Nistrim
stronghold by yourself. If we do this, we do it together. That's
something else Seska would know, too. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Do you think it's a trap? <br>
JANEWAY: Do I think Seska is capable of manipulating you and me with
this? Oh, yes. <br>
CHAKOTAY: On the other hand, it was time for her to deliver, and that
baby we saw did look part Cardassian and part human. <br>
JANEWAY: And knowing Culluh, I'm sure his pride was wounded when he
realised the child wasn't his. It makes sense, Chakotay. It might all
be true. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Still, the safest thing would be to ignore this message and
resume our course. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm not going to resume our course just yet. I want you to
think about it, Chakotay. This has to be your decision. If you choose
to go after him, I know I speak for the entire crew, Starfleet and
Maquis alike, when I say we'll stand behind you. </font></p>

grandfathers. We are far from the bones of my people. But I ask, on
this day of sorrow and uncertainty, that the wisdom of my father find
me and help me understand my dilemma. Speak to me, Father. Speak to me

CHAKOTAY: I have a son, Father. <br>
KOLOPAK: A son, Chakotay? Oh. This is the reason for your despair. Was
he born with two arms and two legs and a heart that beats? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes, but <br>
KOLOPAK: Then it's a cause for celebration. You will make a fine
father. You needn't worry. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm not sure I'm willing to be a father to him. <br>
KOLOPAK: Hmm. Not willing? <br>
CHAKOTAY: He was born without my consent. I had no part in it. <br>
KOLOPAK: No part in it? Well, it's been a long time, so forgive me, but
it seems that I had to play a part before your mother could conceive. <br>
CHAKOTAY: My DNA was taken from me, used by a woman to impregnate
herself without my permission. <br>
KOLOPAK: I see. You're trying to decide whether you should accept the
child in your heart. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's more than that. <br>
KOLOPAK: But it must begin with that! <br>
CHAKOTAY: How do you take a child into your heart who is forced upon
you by a mother's deception? <br>
KOLOPAK: He knows nothing of deception. He is innocent. Centuries ago,
when the women of our tribe were raped by white conquerors, many gave
birth to their children, and we did not reject them. They were accepted
by the tribe. One was a direct ancestor of ours, Chakotay. His name was
Ce Acatl. He became a great leader of our people. Here is a man who was
given life without his mother's consent. Are you so different from her?
And is your child so different from Ce Acatl? <br>
CHAKOTAY: No. <br>
KOLOPAK: He is your son, Chakotay, and he is a child of our people. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">NEELIX:
I've been in touch with the Talaxian mining colony on Prema Two.
They're willing to come to our assistance if we run into trouble. <br>
PARIS: That's good for about forty hours if we average warp two. After
that we're out of their comm. range. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, it's nice to know we have friends in the area. Thank
you, Neelix. <br>
TUVOK: I recommend a full diagnostic of our tactical array prior to the
start of the mission, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Agreed. But I want more from Tactical, Lieutenant. I want to
anticipate a trap, and I want a few tricks up our sleeves if we need
them. <br>
KIM: Captain. I could programme the deflector grid to make it look like
we have help on the way. I'll show you what I mean. Excuse me, Doctor. <br>
TORRES: Echo displacement. <br>
KIM: Exactly. This is how we'd look to the enemy's sensors. If we
generate multiple decoy images like these, the Kazon would think that
ships are coming toward us. We could create as many as we want. <br>
JANEWAY: That's a good start, Harry. It should distract them for a
while. But what else can we do if we're eventually intercepted by a
superior force? <br>
EMH [OC]: If you don't mind, I do have something to add. <br>
(Kim restores the EMH to the wall monitor.) <br>
EMH [on monitor]: Thank you. Captain, I hesitate to offer suggestions
in a field of endeavour that is not within my usual area of expertise.<br>
JANEWAY: Please, Doctor, your suggestions on any subject are always
welcome. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: Really? In that case, you may expect several more on
a variety of matters in the near future. Right now may I suggest that
we also consider attempting to create an actual holographic illusion of
friendly ships? <br>
TORRES: With all due respect, Doctor, we can't even figure out how to
project you into this room. How are we supposed to create holographic
ships in space? <br>
EMH [on monitor]: I would humbly submit that my programme is far more
sophisticated than your run of
the mill hologram. In fact, projecting the illusion of a large,
three-dimensional object has been a trick of magicians for centuries. <br>
PARIS: We'll just do it with mirrors. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: Mister Paris's predictable attempts at humour
notwithstanding, that is precisely what I would suggest. Installing
holo-emitters along the hull with parabolic mirrors to enlarge the
images as they are reflected into space. <br>
KIM: We're going to use up a lot of our power reserves trying to pull
it off. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If these ships can fool the Kazon, it's worth it. <br>
TUVOK: But can they? If the Kazon scan the holograms, they will
immediately realise there are no life signs on board, no power
signatures. <br>
JANEWAY: Okay, so we can't fool them for long, but maybe it'll be long
enough. It's an advantage, and we'll need every advantage we can get on
this mission. Work with the Doctor on it, B'Elanna. Mister Kim. Cut
power to all systems to minimum requirements. I don't want to show up
on any Kazon long range scanners. Mister Paris, locate the warp
signature from Culluh's ship and set a course to follow, warp two. <br>
PARIS: Aye, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Dismissed. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Uh, excuse me, but there is one more thing. Thank you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CHAKOTAY:
It's not Culluh's ship. Looks more like a shuttle. <br>
JANEWAY: Slow to impulse. Set an intercept course, Mister Paris. Have
they indicated the nature of the distress? <br>
KIM: Just a signal, Captain. No response to our hails. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's go to Red alert. <br>
KIM: Visual range. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. <br>
KIM: Showing one life sign, adult Kazon male. He's in critical
condition. <br>
JANEWAY: Janeway to Sickbay. Prepare to receive an emergency transport.
<br>
KES [OC]: Standing by, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Commander. Mister Tuvok, you have the Bridge. Remain at Red
alert. <br>
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KES: His
hip is broken. Showing severe inflammation in the bronchial tissue. <br>
EMH: It appears he inhaled noxious gases vented in the damaged shuttle.
Forty milligrams pulmozine. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I know this man. His name's Teirna. He's one of Seska's
aides. She had him work me over when I was on their ship. <br>
TEIRNA: Seska is dead. Seska thought that she could manipulate the
Maje. She bragged about it to me more than once. But this time, she was
wrong. We had just launched the buoy with the message for you. Then
they came for her. They cut her throat as Culluh watched. He ordered
them to execute me, but I bribed one of the guards to get me to a
shuttle. As soon as he saw it leaving, Culluh opened fire, destroyed my
life support systems. He left me in space to die. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What about the child? <br>
TEIRNA: Taken to the Gema Four colony to be raised as a servant. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We'll be needing your help getting to the Gema system. <br>
TEIRNA: You're going after him? This ship, alone? I want nothing to do
with this. I'm not taking you into Nistrim space. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Under the circumstances, I'd say you don't have much of a
choice. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Doctor's
office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CHAKOTAY:
What's his prognosis? <br>
EMH: He'll be on his feet in a day or two but there's still a number of
things we need to keep an eye on. He's had a nasty concussion, spinal
cord trauma and a polycythemia, the cause of which I've yet to
discover. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Polycythemia? <br>
EMH: An abnormal increase in the number of red blood cells. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'd like you to run an autonomic response analysis the next
time I question him. <br>
EMH: I'm afraid that won't help you determine if he's telling you the
truth, Commander. An ARA depends on making a baseline comparison with
the known response for a given species. Any Tom, Dick or Harry from the
Alpha Quadrant, I could probably help you, but not with any of the new
species of the Delta Quadrant. Regarding his veracity, it may help you
to know that if we'd arrived an hour later, he would have been dead
from his injuries. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TORRES:
The molecular variance residual on his shuttle is evidence of disruptor
blasts and the signature is Kazon, so at least that part of his story
seems to be true. <br>
KIM: Plus, we confirmed nitrogen tetroxide fumes were in the cabin. If
all this was part of a Kazon scheme, he had to be willing to breathe
poison for hours before we got there. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Have you found anything at all that would cast doubt on his
story? <br>
KIM: No. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I still don't trust him. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TEIRNA:
The trip would take six days at warp two. <br>
NEELIX: Four days if you didn't take such a circuitous route, if we
simply went across the Tenarus cluster. <br>
TEIRNA: You would encounter the Nistrim fleet before a single day
passed. Anyone who knows this part of space will tell you the same
thing. <br>
NEELIX: It so happens that I do know this part of space, my Kazon
friend. I just wanted to see if you would tell us the truth. The route
he suggests is safer, Captain. <br>
TEIRNA: Of course, it's safer. I don't want to run into Culluh any more
than you do. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We might have more success avoiding him if you gave us the
command codes for the Nistrim defence net. <br>
TUVOK: Computer, display tactical overview of our current course. <br>
TEIRNA: Enter code sequence four nine one one seven zero Culluh. <br>
(A network of connected satellites shows up, and a curved passage
through them.) <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Paris, adjust our course to avoid the defence net. <br>
PARIS: Aye, Captain. <br>
TEIRNA: That is not an end to the danger. We are heading into an area
of space populated by Kazon factions that are loyal to no one. They
will attack without provocation. </font></p>

Vessel approaching, coordinates three one four mark two one. <br>
KIM: Signature is Kazon. <br>
JANEWAY: Red alert. Configuration of the ship, Mister Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: A small raider, Captain. It does not pose a significant threat.
Nevertheless, it is powering up its weapon systems. <br>
KIM: Shields are holding. <br>
JANEWAY: Return fire. <br>
TUVOK: The raider is breaking off its attack. <br>
KIM: Minor damage to secondary command processors on deck twelve. EPS
power supplies and isolinear controllers are offline. No casualties,
though. <br>
JANEWAY: Begin repairs, Mister Kim. Any other sign of Kazon ships,
Lieutenant? <br>
PARIS: Nothing on long range sensors. The raider is continuing to
retreat. We should have a couple of hours to ourselves at least. <br>
JANEWAY: Good. We can use them. Stand down Red alert. <br>
PARIS: Captain, we're about to go beyond the comm. range of the
Talaxian colony. Just thought you'd like to know. <br>

SUDER: Please. Please come in. Won't you sit down? Excuse the mess. I
wasn't expecting company. Can I get you some tea? Have you had lunch? <br>
JANEWAY: Nothing, thank you. Lieutenant Tuvok has been telling me about
your progress. <br>
SUDER: Has he? Well, I'm, I'm very grateful to him, Captain. I still
have a lot to learn of course, but he is an excellent tutor. When we
first started our studies, I, I thought <br>
TUVOK: The Captain's time is limited, Mister Suder. <br>
SUDER: What? Oh. Of course. <br>
TUVOK: I have explained your proposal to her. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd like to know more about it, Mister Suder. What exactly
would be involved? <br>
SUDER: Yes, yes. Let me show you. I've actually had very encouraging
results with a new gene splicing technique. I created a targeted
restriction enzyme to facilitate the hybrid. <br>
JANEWAY: And you feel you could experiment on our airponic crops here,
in your quarters? <br>
SUDER: Absolutely. I would make this an airponic laboratory, and all I
would need are a few plants, certain chemicals and equipment. <br>
JANEWAY: What sort of chemicals and equipment? <br>
SUDER: Nothing dangerous. I, I prepared a list. <br>
JANEWAY: It's an interesting proposition, Mister Suder. Let me discuss
it with Kes and Lieutenant Tuvok, and I'll get back to you. <br>
SUDER: I've already discussed it with Kes, and she is very interested. <br>
JANEWAY: Good. Let me give it some thought. <br>
SUDER: If you're worried you can't trust me, Captain <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok has assured me <br>
SUDER: I only want to do something. Something for the ship. <br>

are making an adequate recovery, Mister Teirna. The only matter that I
simply cannot understand is this lingering polycythemia. <br>
TEIRNA: I feel fine. <br>
EMH: The medical record you gave us does not indicate any prior blood
disorders. Might it be an inherited trait? Do you know if your parents
ever <br>
TEIRNA: My parents were killed in a Trabe attack shortly after I was
born. <br>
EMH: I see. Well, we'll need to monitor this condition for a while. It
might be due to some chemical imbalance that our sensors aren't
recognising, possibly the result of the toxins you inhaled while on the
shuttle. You're welcome. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Feeling better? <br>
TEIRNA: I'm sure I'll make a complete recovery just in time for the
Gema colony's defence force to destroy us all. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You're still not optimistic about our chances, are you? <br>
TEIRNA: No. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We've had no problem repelling the attacks so far. <br>
TEIRNA: Attacks? When there's a real Nistrim attack, you'll know it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You still have pride in the Nistrim, don't you, Teirna? Even
after what they did to you. I remember that pride in your eyes when you
pounded me with your fists while I was tied to a chair. And I can see
it in your eyes now, and that scares the hell out of me. <br>
TEIRNA: You must scare easily, Federation. <br>
(Chakotay pushes Teirna up against the wall.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tell me something, Teirna. Every Kazon attack seems to focus
on our starboard ventral. Think that might be some kind of pattern? <br>
TEIRNA: I wouldn't know. <br>

fifteen, sections A four through C eighteen. <br>

KIM: Deck twelve is in shambles. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We barely have time to begin repairs before they attack it

KIM: At least no one was hurt. The secondary command processors are
non-functional. We'll have to rebuild them. I'd say we're looking at
two days work if we're not attacked again. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Why would these factions of Kazon, loyal to no one, all have
the same agenda? And why would that agenda focus on a nonessential area
of the ship? <br>
JANEWAY: I don't know, but it feels like we're being pecked to death by
ducks. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We can't just stay on this course and wait to see what they
have in store for us. <br>

my own way. Set a course to intercept their lead ship. <br>
