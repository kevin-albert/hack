YOUNG TUVOK: Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations. I know all
about Vulcan philosophies. <br>
VULCAN MASTER: Why have you come here? <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: I was sent against my will. <br>
VULCAN MASTER: Then I suggest you leave. <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: I'm not a prisoner? <br>
VULCAN MASTER: Only of your emotions, or so I have been told. <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: My emotions free me. <br>
VULCAN MASTER: I see. It's regrettable that I won't be able to teach
you. <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: Where should I go? <br>
VULCAN MASTER: Are you seeking my counsel? <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: I can't return home. My father's banished me. <br>
VULCAN MASTER: Your school? <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: They revoked my seat. <br>
VULCAN MASTER: Why? <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: Because I refused to deny myself passion, the way you and
men like my father do. <br>
VULCAN MASTER: You reject logic. <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: If I was meant to deny feelings, why was I born with them?
Where's the logic in that? <br>
VULCAN MASTER: Hidden for you to find. Or in plain sight for you to
ignore. <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: You speak in riddles because the truth frightens you. <br>
VULCAN MASTER: You're right, it does frighten me. You are surprised to
hear a Vulcan master admit to having emotions? <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: Yes. <br>
VULCAN MASTER: Emotions can be a powerful tool. To deny their existence
is illogical. But you must learn to control them. <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: Why? <br>
VULCAN MASTER: You wish to be taught? <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: I would question everything you say. <br>
VULCAN MASTER: You would not be a worthy pupil otherwise. Let us begin.

shouts.) &nbsp; <br>NOSS: Tu

walks up a gully. Another jumps out in front of her and grabs her bags.
She is overpowered, but before one can stab her, Tuvok grabs his arm.
He knocks him out, and slams the second alien into the rock cliff. The
first wakes, and gets a neck pinch.) <br>TUVOK:
I'm Commander Tuvok of the Starship Voyager. Tuvok. <br>

Mayday, mayday. Paris to Voyager, Respond. Oh, come on. <br>
TUVOK: Her name is Noss. She was attacked by two humanoid males. <br>
PARIS: Sure she didn't attack them? <br>
TUVOK: They were attempting to rob her. <br>
PARIS: Seems to be a local pastime. <br>
TUVOK: She requires medical attention. <br>
PARIS: I'd love to help, but somebody stole our med-kits. <br>(Tuvok returns them, and Paris sees to Noss' injuries..)<br>
TUVOK: Food. What's the status of the shuttle? <br>
PARIS: Fractures throughout the hull, environmental systems down,
impulse engines are beyond repair. Told you we should have brought the
Delta Flyer. <br>
TUVOK: Communications appear to be functional. <br>
PARIS: It won't do us any good. Every time I transmit a signal, it gets
bounced back by the distortion field that pulled us down here. It looks
like we fell into some kind of gravity well. As far as I can tell, this
planet is a part of an entire solar system that is stuck in a pocket of
subspace. <br>
TUVOK: Fascinating. <br>
PARIS: Yeah. Well, scientific interest aside, I don't see any easy way
out. <br>
TUVOK: No doubt Voyager has begun a rescue effort. The Doctor? <br>
PARIS: His mobile emitter was damaged during the crash. With a little
luck, I might be able to repair it and bring him back online. <br>
TUVOK: Make it your top priority. <br>
NOSS: Gren, gren. <br>
PARIS: What is it? <br>
TUVOK: Thirteen humanoids approaching. The same species that attacked
her. Gather as many supplies as you can carry. We're leaving. <br>
PARIS: You really think it's smart to abandon the shuttle? <br>
TUVOK: Noss appears to have survived here for some time. It's logical
to assume she has access to a more secure shelter. <br>
NOSS: Nemok. Alen. Alen. <br>

Doesn't look like this bird's gonna fly either. <br>
TUVOK: Minimal power and life support, but the ship is protected by a
forcefield. <br>
PARIS: That explains how she's been able to survive here. Anything
resembling an engine? <br>
TUVOK: I'm detecting engine debris two kilometres away. It is of the
same configuration as this vessel. <br>
PARIS: Great. We've got two unusable ships, and the only way Voyager is
going to detect our distress call is if they crash land right on top of us. <br>
TUVOK: Progress? <br>(Referring to the mobile emitter.)<br>
PARIS: The optronic relays took heavy damage. I'm bypassing the primary
circuits. Come on, Doc. I know you're in there. <br>(The EMH solidifies.)<br>
EMH: I'm guessing we hit a snag. <br>
TUVOK: An accurate assumption. <br>
NOSS: Rev den ut. Ut rev? <br>
EMH: Tun sank. Ton rev ut teem sayd. <br>
PARIS: You speak her language? <br>
EMH: A universal translator was written into my programme. <br>
PARIS: Ask her how long she's been here. If she knows a way to get back
through that sinkhole. <br>
EMH: Deen ya tone ud la kar. Padeen nefka minruk? <br>
NOSS: Laka heen. Zen nik lurka. Irut tota. Maez bemrukaya. <br>
PARIS: What'd she say?&nbsp;<br>
EMH: She said she's been here fourteen seasons, and in that time, she's
seen many ships come down. but she's never seen one go back up again.

large spiders. You place a gizmo on a large rock which irritates the
creature enough to make it come out. Then you stab it with a

Come back, you little bloodsucker. <br>(Noss laughs.) <br>PARIS: I don't know what's worse, catching
them or eating them. <br>
NOSS: No poison. <br>

should have left the hunting to you and Tuvok. <br>

Shut down my programme? Why? <br>
TUVOK: Our resources are severely limited. We may need your mobile

EMH: I'm a Doctor, not a battery. <br>
TUVOK: Until we're rescued, or you are needed for an emergency, I must
insist that you remain offline. <br>

EMH: If Mister Paris' hunting ability is any indication, maybe we
should take him offline. <br>
PARIS: Thanks for the vote of confidence, Doc. <br>

NOSS: Your duties. Where you sleep. What you eat. Music. Friends. <br>
TUVOK: Why is any of that relevant? <br>
NOSS: Because it is you. <br>(Later,&nbsp; at dinner.)<br>PARIS:
When I first met her, she wouldn't even look at me. But she warmed up
after, oh, three years. <br>
EMH: The longest flirtation in Starfleet history. <br>

PARIS: No. I mean she likes you. <br>
TUVOK: What are you implying? <br>
PARIS: Oh, come on, Tuvok. You may be cold, but you're not blind. <br>
TUVOK: Need I remind you that I am married. <br>
PARIS: Your wife is fifty thousand light years away, in a different
layer of space! The chances of you ever seeing her again are
practically nonexistent. <br>
TUVOK: Excuse me.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
What are you doing? <br>
TUVOK: I'm recalibrating the distress beacon. <br>
PARIS: Listen. What I said in there, about your wife. I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to hurt your feelings. <br>
TUVOK: I have no feelings for you to hurt. <br>
PARIS: I think you do. You work hard to bury them, but they're there.
And even if they're not, this is home now. You might as well accept it
and try to find as much happiness as you can. Listen, you have a chance
to make a decent life for yourself here. <br>
TUVOK: There is still a possibility that Voyager will rescue us. You
may see Lieutenant Torres again. <br>
PARIS: If I didn't know you better, I'd say you were trying to cheer me
up, Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: Is there a point to your pessimism? <br>
PARIS: It's not pessimism, it's practicality. You of all people should
understand that. Look, I've never met your wife but if she's half a
logical as you are, I bet you she'd tell you the same thing. <br>
TUVOK: Your attempt to play matchmaker is misguided. I am not
experiencing Pon farr. <br>
PARIS: What difference does it make? You obviously care about Noss. If
you won't admit it to me, at least admit it to yourself. <br>
TUVOK: I respect her ability to survive. <br>
PARIS: It's more than that. I've seen the way you look at her. <br>

YOUNG TUVOK: Are you cataloguing my emotions? <br>
VULCAN MASTER: What is the source of your self-pity? <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: Isn't it obvious? If I weren't Vulcan, I wouldn't be here
now going through this pointless ritual. <br>
VULCAN MASTER: You see only what is in front of you. You must learn to
see behind you. <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: Another riddle. I have no eyes to see behind me. <br>
VULCAN MASTER: You have the eyes of memory. The knowledge of why you
are here, and why you have lost control. Tell me your story. <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: My father's already explained it. <br>
VULCAN MASTER: I wish to hear it from you. <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: Her name's Jara. Her father's a Terrelian diplomat. She's
been granted a seat at my school. <br>

her. <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: Yes. <br>
VULCAN MASTER: You love her. <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: Yes. <br>
VULCAN MASTER: Does she love you? <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: No. She's, Jara doesn't return my feelings. <br>
VULCAN MASTER: What if I were to say that I received a letter from your
father, telling me that Jara is in love with one of your fellow
students? <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: That's a lie! Who is it? <br>
VULCAN MASTER: Jealousy? <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: I'll challenge him. <br>
VULCAN MASTER: That would be illogical, because I have received no such
letter. <br>
YOUNG TUVOK: You're trying to trick me. <br>
VULCAN MASTER: No. I'm trying to help you to understand. Shon-ha'lock,
love, is the most dangerous emotion of all. It produces many other
emotions. Jealousy, shame, rage, grief. You must learn to suppress them
all, otherwise they will consume you. I can sense emotions building
inside you like a gathering storm. If we begin now, we may be able to
stop them.

JANEWAY: Scan the region. Look for plasma emissions or EM

KIM: Nothing out of the ordinary. Hydrogen, helium, space dust. <br>
JANEWAY: There has to be something out there. Shuttles don't just
vanish into thin air. &nbsp;<br>(Whumph!)<br>

TORRES: I can't establish a field. <br>
JANEWAY: Then we need more power to the impulse engines. <br>
TORRES: That won't be enough. We've got to find a way to counter the

JANEWAY: B'Elanna, vent three million isodynes of plasma from the

YOST [on viewscreen]: The rift will be closed by then. <br>
JANEWAY: Some of our crew are trapped inside. <br>
YOST [on viewscreen]: I am sorry. We have lost eleven ships to the
distortion over the last year. It must be sealed. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What about your people? <br>
YOST [on viewscreen]: Even if there were survivors, there's no way to
rescue them. The best we can do is to prevent others from being
trapped. <br>
JANEWAY: We can't abandon our crew. If you could delay your mission <br>
YOST [on viewscreen]: My orders are to seal the rift by this time
tomorrow. If you want to attempt a rescue between now and then, the
risk is yours to take, but I wouldn't advise it.<br>(Transmission ends.) <br>

distress beacon on a Class-D planet. <br>
JANEWAY: Vulcan, human, alien lifesigns. At least we know they're
alive. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Keep reading. <br>
JANEWAY: There's astronomical data here covering a three month period.
How is that possible? <br>
CHAKOTAY: There seems to be some sort of temporal differential. <br>
JANEWAY: How big a differential? <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's difficult to say, but every hour that passes for us
could mean weeks, even months for Tom and Tuvok. <br>
JANEWAY: Months trying to survive in a Class-D environment? More than
likely, they've assumed that we left them behind long ago. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Ready for the bad news? <br>
JANEWAY: You're kidding. <br>

for her became a kind of insanity. <br>
PARIS: Tuvok, everyone feels a little insane when they fall in love, but
it's worth the risk. <br>
TUVOK: For you, perhaps. But I am Vulcan. My natural emotions are
erratic, volatile. If I don't control them, they will control me. <br>
PARIS: Whatever happened to Jara? <br>
TUVOK: I chose to leave her. I spent several months in isolation,
studying with a Vulcan Master. I learned to suppress my emotions. <br>
PARIS: Too bad. <br>(A whirlpool opens in the sky. Tuvok gets out his tricorder.)<br>
TUVOK: Gravimetric distortions. <br>
PARIS: What's causing them? <br>
TUVOK: Unknown.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM: No
response to our hails, Captain. <br>
SEVEN: At this rate, their anti-graviton beam will seal the distortion
in approximately twenty nine minutes. <br>
JANEWAY: Transporter status? <br>
TORRES: I've completed the reconfiguration, but we're only going to be
able to relay one transporter beam through the probe. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We'll have to get Tom and Tuvok within a two metre radius of
the distress beacon. <br>
JANEWAY: Harry? <br>
KIM: I've opened a channel. <br>
JANEWAY: Voyager to away team.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
What is it? <br>
TUVOK: The distress beacon. We're receiving a transmission. <br>
PARIS: Can you route it through your comm. system? If I'm right, this
message was sent almost nine hours ago on a very slow carrier wave. <br>
EMH: Can you speed it up? <br>
PARIS: I'll try. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Voyager to away team. A transporter beam with a radius of
two metres will activate at the coordinates of your distress beacon in
exactly thirty minutes. <br>
EMH: Thirty minutes? That would have been over eight hours ago! <br>
PARIS: Shh, there's more. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Be advised we've detected a temporal difference between
our two positions. According to our calculations, the differential
ratio is point four seven four four seconds per minute. Repeat. Voyager
to away team. A transporter beam with
a radius of two metres<br>
TUVOK: According to that formula, thirty minutes would translate to two
days, eleven hours and forty seven seconds. <br>
EMH: Well, we've waited this long. <br>
NOSS: Tom. <br>(Aliens are massing for an attack. They detonate charges at the forcefield perimeter.)<br>
TUVOK: The forcefield is holding. <br>
PARIS: Not for long if they keep pelting us with these photon grenades.
<br>
EMH: How are we supposed to hold them off for two more days?

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
The rift will be sealed in less than two minutes. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
The forcefield's losing power. Time? <br>
EMH: We still have another hour before transport. <br>
TUVOK: Where are you going? <br>
NOSS: To repair the field generator. <br>
TUVOK: I will accompany you. <br>
NOSS: No. You stay. Prepare for the attack. <br>
TUVOK: You can't go alone. <br>
NOSS: Risking two lives would be illogical.

seconds. Let's hope they don't stand us up. Begin twenty second

TUVOK: Problems? <br>
PARIS: I've spent the last two months wondering if I'd ever see
B'Elanna again. As far as she's concerned, it's only been two days. I
guess I expected her to have missed me, too. <br>
TUVOK: Were it not for the time differential, I'm sure she would have
experienced a deep sense of loss. <br>
PARIS: You know something? I always thought that beneath that cold,
Vulcan exterior lay a even colder Vulcan interior. Now, I'm convinced
you're a hopeless romantic. <br>
