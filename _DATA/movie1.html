COLUMBIA VOICE: (too faint to understand)<br>
LIEUTENANT: This is Epsilon Nine. Am boosting output. How do you read this?<br>
COLUMBIA VOICE: All right. (too faint to understand)<br>
LIEUTENANT: Scout Columbia NCC six two one to rendezvous with Scout Revere NCC five nine five on stardate seven four one one point four. Further orders to be relayed at that time. Signed, Commodore Probert, Starfleet. End of transmission.<br>
COLUMBIA VOICE: All right. (too faint to understand)<br>

<b>[Epsilon IX - interior]</b>
<p>
LIEUTENANT: Our sensor drone is intercepting this on Quad L fourteen.<br>
BRANCH: That's in Klingon boundaries. Who are they fighting?<br>
LIEUTENANT: Unknown, sir.<br>
TECHNICIAN: I have an exterior visual.<br>
(the battle cruisers are destroyed by energy bolts from the Cloud)<br>
LIEUTENANT: We've plotted a course on that Cloud, Commander. It will pass into Federation space fairly close to us.<br>
BRANCH: Heading?<br>
LIEUTENANT: Sir, it's on a precise heading for Earth!<br>
<p>
<b>[Surface of Vulcan]</b>
<p>
FEMALE MASTER: (in Vulcan) Our ancestors cast out their animal passions on these very sands, ...saving our race through the attainment of Kolinahr.<br>
MALE MASTER: (in Vulcan) Kolinahr, through which all emotion is renounced and shed.<br>
FEMALE MASTER: (in Vulcan) You have laboured for many seasons, Spock ...and you have proved yourself worthy ...to receive this symbol of pure logic.<br>
(Spock stops her putting the ancient pendant around his neck)<br>
FEMALE MASTER: (in Vulcan) Your thoughts, give them to me. Our minds are joined, Spock, ...together, and as one. I sense the consciousness calling to you from space. ...Your human blood is touched by it, Spock. You have not yet attained Kolinahr. He must search elsewhere for his answer. He shall not find it here. Live long and prosper, Spock.<br>

<b>[San Francisco Air Tram station]</b>
<p>
KIRK: Commander Sonak, you received your appointment as Enterprise science officer?<br>
SONAK: Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.<br>
KIRK: Why aren't you on board?<br>
SONAK: Captain Decker requested I complete final science briefing here before we leave on our mission.<br>
KIRK: Here? At Starfleet? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock.<br>
SONAK: Which will require twenty more hours at minimum.<br>
KIRK: Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.<br>
SONAK: Report to you, sir?<br>
KIRK: It is my intention to be on that ship following that meeting. Report to me in one hour.<br>
<p>
<b>[Orbital Office Complex]</b>
<p>
SCOTT: Admiral.<br>
KIRK: Mister Scott.<br>
SCOTT: Those departure orders, twelve hours, Starfleet cannot be serious.<br>
KIRK: Why aren't the Enterprise transporters operating, Mister Scott?<br>
SCOTT: A wee problem, sir, really. Just temporary. Admiral, we have just spent eighteen months redesigning and refitting the Enterprise. How in the name of hell do they expect to have her ready in twelve hours?<br>
KIRK: Take me over, please.<br>
<p>
<b>[Travel Pod]</b>
<p>
SCOTT: She needs more work, a shakedown.<br>
KIRK: Mister Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet. ...The only starship in interception range is the Enterprise. Ready, or not, she launches in twelve hours.<br>
SCOTT: The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines are not yet tested at warp power. And an untried Captain.<br>
KIRK: Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a stale but I wouldn't exactly consider myself untried. They gave her back to me, Scotty.<br>
SCOTT: Gave her back, sir? I doubt it was that easy with Nogura.<br>
KIRK: You're right<br>
SCOTT: Well, any man who could manage such a feat, I wouldna dare disappoint. She'll launch on time, sir, ...and she'll be ready.<br>
(Enterprise flyby)<br>
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Scott.<br>
SCOTT: Aye sir.<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise cargo deck]</b>
<p>
TANNOY VOICE: Cargo bay to launch crew. Travel pod is now available at dock six.<br> 
KIRK: Permission to come aboard, sir?<br>
ENSIGN: Granted, sir. Welcome aboard, Admiral. ...Commander Scott, you're needed in engineering immediately.<br>
SCOTT: Sir, you'll excuse me?<br>
TANNOY VOICE: Flight deck. Prepare for incoming shuttlecraft.<br>
ENSIGN: Sir, if you'll follow me, I'll...<br>
KIRK: I think I can find my way, Ensign.<br>
ENSIGN: Aye sir.<br>

<b>[Enterprise bridge]</b>
<p>
FEMALE CREWMEMBER'S VOICE: What's the problem? I thought you had that circuit patched an hour ago.<br>
MALE CREWMEMBER'S VOICE: We did. And we had to disconnect it.<br>
CREWMEMBER'S VOICES: (general technical chatter)<br>
UHURA: I'll get somebody down there just as soon as I can. ...Captain! Starfleet just signalled your transfer-of-command orders, sir.<br>
SULU: Captain!<br>
KIRK: I appreciate your welcome. I wish the circumstances were less critical. Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder. Keep a channel open.<br>
UHURA: Aye sir.<br>
KIRK: Where's Captain Decker?<br>
SULU: He's in engineering, sir. ...He ...doesn't know.<br>
KIRK: Mister Chekov!<br>
CHEKOV: Aye sir.<br>
KIRK: Assemble the crew on the Recreation Deck at oh four hundred hours. I want to show them what we're facing.<br>
SULU: He wanted her back. He got her!<br>
ALIEN ENSIGN: And Captain Decker? He's been with the ship every minute of her refitting.<br>
UHURA: Ensign, the possibilities of our returning from this mission in one piece may have just doubled.<br>
<p> 
<b>[Enterprise engineering]</b>
<p>
VOICES (OC): Check. Cleary on number six.<br> Space matrix restoration coils. Dilithium crystals.<br> I knew it. The transporter sensor was not activated.<br> Faulty modules.<br>
SCOTT (OC): Cleary! Put a new backup sensor into the unit.<br>
CLEARY (OC): Aye sir.<br>
DECKER: Admiral Kirk! ...We're getting a top brass send off? Don't worry, she'll launch on schedule if we have to tow her out with our bare hands. Right, Scotty?<br>
SCOTT: Aye, yes, that we will, sir.<br>
KIRK: Let's talk.<br>
DECKER: Sure. Let me now when the backup's ready.<br>
SCOTT: Aye sir.<br>
DECKER: With all due respect, sir, I hope this isn't some kind of Starfleet pep talk, I'm really too busy.<br>
KIRK: I'm taking over the center seat, Will.<br>
DECKER: You're what?<br>
KIRK: I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise. You'll stay on as Executive Officer. Temporary grade reduction to Commander.<br>
DECKER: You personally, are assuming command?<br>
KIRK: Yeah.<br>
DECKER: May I ask? Why?<br>
KIRK: My experience, five years out there dealing with unknowns like this, my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew.<br>
DECKER: Admiral, this is an almost totally new Enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.<br>
KIRK: That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, <br>
DECKER: No, Admiral. I don't think you are, not one damn bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and how much you hoped you'd find a way to get a starship command again. Well, it looks like you found a way.<br>
KIRK: Report to the bridge, Commander. Immediately.<br>
DECKER: Aye sir.<br>
CLEARY: Transporter room, come in! Urgent! Redline on the transporters, Mister Scott!<br>
SCOTT: Transporter room, do not engage! Do not...<br>
CLEARY: It's too late. They're beaming now!<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise transporter room]</b>
<p>
RAND: Do you read me Starfleet? Override us. Pull them back!<br>
KIRK: Give it to me. Starfleet, boost your matter gain, we need more signal! ...More signal!<br>
SCOTT: We're losing their pattern.<br>
RAND: Oh, no! They're forming!<br>
WOMAN: (a scream)<br>
SONAK: (a moan)<br>
KIRK: Starfleet, do you have them?<br>
STARFLEET VOICE: Enterprise, ...what we got back didn't live long, ...fortunately.<br>
KIRK: Starfleet, ...Kirk. Please ...express my condolences to their families. Commander Sonak's can be reached through the Vulcan Embassy. There was nothing you could have done, Rand. It wasn't your fault.<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise corridor]</b>
<p>
KIRK: Yeoman! Turboshaft eight?<br>
YEOMAN: Back that way, sir.<br>
KIRK: We have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible.<br>
DECKER: None available, Captain. There's no one available. In fact there's no one who's fully rated on this design.<br>
KIRK: You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you're gonna have to double as science officer.<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise recreation deck]</b>
<p>
KIRK: That's all we know about it, except that it's now fifty-three point four hours away from Earth. Enterprise is the only Federation starship that stands in its way. Our orders are to intercept, investigate, and take whatever action is necessary, ...and possible.<br>
BRIDGE VOICE: Bridge to Captain. Priority signal from Epsilon Nine.<br>
KIRK: Put it on the viewer.<br>
UHURA (OC): On viewer, sir.<br>
BRANCH (on viewer): Enterprise, the Cloud is definitely a power field of some kind. Measures, my God, over two A.U.'s in diameter. Must be something incredible inside there generating it. We're transmitting linguacode friendship messages on all frequencies. No response.<br>
TECHNICIAN (on viewer): I have a null reading at the center of the Cloud, sir.<br>
LIEUTENANT (on viewer): Definitely something inside there but all scans are being reflected back.<br>
BRANCH (on viewer): A kind of power surge.<br> 
LIEUTENANT (on viewer): Receiving an odd pattern now.<br>
BRANCH (on viewer): Enterprise, ...they could be mistaking our scans as a hostile act.<br>
LIEUTENANT (on viewer): They seem to be reacting to our scans, sir.<br>
BRANCH (on viewer): Deflectors, emergency full! We are under attack!<br>
KIRK: External view!<br>

UHURA (OC): Transporter system fully repaired and functioning normally, sir.<br>
SULU: Dock signals clear, Captain.<br>
KIRK: Reply we are holding position awaiting final crew replacements.<br>
UHURA: Aye sir. Transporter personnel reports the Navigator Lieutenant ...Ilia. She's already aboard, and en route to the bridge, sir. She's Deltan, sir.<br>
ILIA: Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.<br>
KIRK: Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.<br>
DECKER: Hello, Ilia.<br>
ILIA: Decker!<br>
DECKER: I was stationed on the Lieutenant's home planet some years ago.<br>
ILIA: 'Commander' Decker?<br>
KIRK: Yes, our Exec and science officer.<br>
DECKER: Captain Kirk has the utmost confidence in me.<br>
KIRK: And in you too, Lieutenant.<br>
ILIA: My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?<br>
KIRK: By all means.<br>
UHURA: Captain, Starfleet reports our last six crewmembers are ready to beam up, ...but one of them is refusing to step into the transporter.<br>
KIRK: Oh? I'll see that he beams up! ...Transporter room.<br>

KIRK: Ellen.<br>
ELLEN: Yes sir.<br>
KIRK: What was the problem down there?<br>
ELLEN: He insisted we go first, sir. Said something about first seeing how it scrambled our molecules.<br>
KIRK: That has a familiar ring, doesn't it? Starfleet, this is Captain Kirk. Beam that officer up now! ...Well, for a man who swore he'd never return to Starfleet.<br>
McCOY: Just a moment, Captain, sir. I'll explain what happened. Your revered Admiral Nogura invoked a little known, and seldom used, reserve activation clause, ...in simpler language, Captain, they drafted me!<br>
KIRK: They didn't!<br>
McCOY: This was your idea! This was your idea, wasn't it?<br>
KIRK: Bones, there's a 'thing' out there...<br>
McCOY: Why is any object we don't understand always called a 'thing'?<br>
KIRK: ...headed this way. I need you. Dammit Bones, I need you. Badly!<br>
McCOY: Permission to come aboard?<br>
RAND (OC): Permission granted, sir.<br>
McCOY: Well, Jim, I hear Chapel's an MD now. Well, I'm gonna need a top nurse, not a doctor who'll argue every little diagnosis with me. And ...they've probably redesigned the whole sickbay, too. I know engineers. They love to change things.<br>

Captain's log, stardate 7412.6. one point eight hours from launch. In order to intercept the intruder at the earliest possible time, we must now risk engaging warp drive while still within the solar system.<br>
<p>
DECKER: Captain, assuming we have full warp capability, accelerating to warp seven on leaving the solar system will bring us to IP with the intruder, twenty point one hours.<br>
KIRK: Well, Bones, do the new medical facilities meet with your approval?<br>
McCOY: They do not. It's like working in a damned computer center.<br>
KIRK: Programming ready?<br>
DECKER: Programme set for standard warp entry, Captain, ...but I still recommend further simulation study.<br>
KIRK: Mister Decker, every minute brings that object closer to Earth! Engineering! Stand by for warp drive.<br>
SCOTT (on intercom): We need further warp simulation on the flow sensors.<br>
KIRK: Engineer, we need warp speed now!<br>
McCOY: Jim, you're pushing. Your people know their jobs.<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise engineering]</b>

KIRK: Mister Scott, we need warp drive as soon as possible.<br>

<b>[Enterprise engineering]</b>

SCOTT: Captain, it was the engine imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. ...It'll happen again if we don't correct it.<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise bridge]</b>
<p>
DECKER: We must correct it.<br>
KIRK: That object out there is less than two days from Earth. We need to intercept while it still is out there. Navigator lay in a new heading to conform with our initial IP. Mister Sulu, you have the conn.<br>
KIRK: Mister Decker, I'd like to see you in my quarters.<br>
McCOY: Mind if I tag along, Captain?<br>
KIRK: Level five.<br>
<p>
<b>[Kirk's quarters]</b>
<p>
KIRK: All right, explanation? Why was my phaser order countermanded?<br>
DECKER: Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channelling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.<br>
KIRK: Then you acted properly, of course.<br>
DECKER: Thank you, sir. ...I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.<br>
KIRK: You saved the ship.<br>
DECKER: I'm aware of that, sir.<br>
KIRK: Stop ...competing with me, Decker!<br>
DECKER: Permission to speak freely, sir?<br>
KIRK: Granted.<br>
DECKER: Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's redesign, in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardises this mission.<br>
KIRK: I trust you will ...nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?<br>
DECKER: Yes sir. I'll do that.<br>
KIRK: Then I won't keep you from your duties any longer, Commander.<br>

ILIA: No.<br>
<p>
<b>[Kirk's quarters]</b>
<p>
KIRK: Make your point, Doctor.<br>
McCOY: The point, Captain, is that it's you who's competing. ...You rammed getting this command down Starfleet's throat. You've used this emergency to get Enterprise back.<br>
KIRK: And I intend to keep her, is it that what you're saying?<br>
McCOY: Yes! It's an obsession, an obsession that can blind you to far more immediate, and critical responsibilities. Your reaction to Decker is an example.<br>

KIRK: The Kolinahr is also the discipline you broke ...to join us. Will you, please, ...sit down!<br>
SPOCK: On Vulcan I began sensing a consciousness of a force more powerful than I have ever encountered. Thought patterns of exactingly perfect order. I believe they emanate from the intruder. I believe it may hold my answers.<br>

I am passing through a connecting tunnel. Apparently a kind of plasma-energy conduit. Possibly a field coil for gigantic imaging systems. Curious. I am seeing images of planets, moons, stars, whole galaxies all stored in here, recorded. It could be a record of V'Ger's entire journey. But who, or what, are we dealing with? The Epsilon Nine station, stored here with every detail. Captain, I am now quite convinced that all of this is V'Ger. That we are inside a living machine. Ilia.

KIRK: That should trigger Voyager's transmitter.<br>
SPOCK: Voyager is not transmitting its data, Captain.<br>
ILIA PROBE: The Creator must join with V'Ger.<br>
KIRK: Uhura! Repeat the final sequence.<br>
ILIA PROBE: The Creator must join with V'Ger.<br>
SPOCK: Voyager is not transmitting, Captain, because it did not receive the final sequence.<br>
McCOY: Jim, we're down to ten minutes.<br>
KIRK: Enterprise, stand by. The antenna leads are melted away.<br>
SPOCK: Yes Captain, just now. By V'Ger itself.<br>
KIRK: Why?<br>
SPOCK: To prevent reception.<br>
KIRK: Of course.<br>
DECKER: To bring the Creator here, to finish transmitting the code in person, ...to touch the Creator.<br>
McCOY: To capture God! V'Ger's going to be in for one hell of a disappointment.<br>
SPOCK: Perhaps not. ...Captain, ...V'Ger must evolve. Its knowledge has reached the limits of this universe and it must evolve. What it requires of its God, Doctor is the answer to its question, 'Is there nothing more?<br>
McCOY: What more is there than the universe, Spock?<br>
DECKER: Other, dimensions, higher levels of beings.<br>
SPOCK: The existence of which cannot be proved logically, therefore V'Ger is incapable of believing in them.<br>
KIRK: What V'Ger needs in order to evolve is a human quality. Our capacity to leap beyond logic.<br>
DECKER: And joining with its Creator might accomplish that.<br>
McCOY: You mean that this machine wants to physically join with a human? Is that possible?<br>
DECKER: Let' find out.<br>
KIRK: Decker!<br>
DECKER: I'm gonna key the sequence through the ground-test computer.<br>
McCOY: Decker! You don't know what that will do to you.<br>
DECKER: Yes, I do, Doctor.<br>
KIRK: Decker, don't!<br>
DECKER: Jim, I want this. As much as you wanted the Enterprise, I want this.<br>

SULU: Captain.<br>
KIRK: Spock! Did we just see the beginnings of a new lifeform?<br>
SPOCK: Yes, Captain, we witnessed a birth. Possibly a next step in our evolution.<br>
KIRK: I wonder.<br>
McCOY: Well, it's been a long time since I delivered a baby, and I hope we got this one off to a good start.<br>
KIRK: I hope so, too. I think we gave it the ability to create its own sense of purpose. Out of our own human weaknesses, and the drive that compels us to overcome them.<br>
McCOY: And a lot of foolish human emotions. Right, Mister Spock?<br>
SPOCK: Quite true, Doctor. Unfortunately it will have to deal with them as well.<br> 
UHURA: A communication from Starfleet. They're requesting damage and injury reports and complete vessel status.<br>
KIRK: Report two casualties. Lieutenant Ilia. Captain Decker.<br>
UHURA (OC): Aye sir.<br>
KIRK: Correction! They're not casualties. They are... List them as missing. Vessel status, fully operational.
<br>
UHURA (OC): Aye sir.<br>
KIRK: Mister Scott! Shall we give the Enterprise a proper shakedown?<br>
SCOTT: I would say it's time for that, sir, aye. We can have you back on Vulcan in for days, Mister Spock.<br>
SPOCK: Unnecessary, Mister Scott. My task on Vulcan is completed.<br>
KIRK: Mister Sulu, ahead, warp one.<br>
SULU (OC): Warp one, sir.<br>
DIFALCO (OC): Heading, sir?<br>
KIRK: Out there. Thataway!<br>

THE HUMAN ADVENTURE IS JUST BEGINNING.<BR>
