Captain's log, stardate 45494.2. We're investigating a series of
subspace signals that may indicate intelligent life in the Epsilon
Silar System. We are within sensor range.

DATA: The characteristic response to the Kriskov Gambit is to counter
with the el-Mitra Exchange, particularly since I have already taken
both your rooks. By missing that opportunity, you have left your king
vulnerable. <br>
TROI: We'll see. <br>
DATA: As you wish, Counsellor. Check. <br>
(Troi makes her move) <br>
DATA: Intriguing. You have devised a completely unanticipated response
to a classic attack. You will checkmate my king in seven moves. <br>
TROI: Data, chess isn't just a game of ploys and gambits. It's a game
of intuition. <br>
DATA: You are a challenging opponent, Counsellor. <br>
TROI: Thanks, but don't think a compliment's going to get you out of
our bet. You owe me one Samarian Sunset made in the traditional style,
as only you can make it, Data. <br>
DATA: I will honour our agreement.
