Lieutenant, Ensign. <br>
KIM: Hey, Seven. <br>
TORRES: Have some dinner. The potato salad isn't half bad. <br>
SEVEN: I do not require nutrition at this time. I would like to talk
with you. <br>
KIM: Okay. <br>
SEVEN: Ensign Kim, what is your place of origin? <br>
KIM: You mean, where am I from? Well, I was born in South Carolina, but
I grew up in <br>
SEVEN: Lieutenant Torres, explain why you became a member of the
Maquis. <br>
TORRES: It was through Chakotay. I met him. Well, actually, he saved my
life <br>
SEVEN: List the sports you play. <br>
KIM: I've dabbled in quite a few. Tennis, Pareses Squares, but my
favourite is volleyball. <br>
SEVEN: Specify the foods you find enjoyable. <br>
TORRES: Seven, what is this? <br>
SEVEN: Describe the nature of your sexual relationship with Lieutenant
Paris. <br>
TORRES: Okay, that's it. <br>
EMH: Computer, freeze programme. Would you care to explain what you're
doing? <br>
SEVEN: I'm doing exactly what you instructed me to do. <br>
EMH: I hardly think so. I created this programme to help you become
more comfortable in social situations, not to practice alienating
people. <br>
SEVEN: You made recommendations about how to carry on a conversation. <br>
EMH: That's true. <br>
SEVEN: You said it's helpful if people feel you're interested in them. <br>
EMH: Correct. <br>
SEVEN: And that drawing them out by asking them about themselves is one
way to demonstrate that interest. <br>
EMH: That doesn't mean subjecting them to an interrogation. You have to
let them answer, listen to what they're saying. Ask another question on the
same subject. Take your time. Shall we try again? <br>
SEVEN: I believe I am overdue for my weekly medical maintenance. We
should go. <br>
EMH: Seven, you've never volunteered for a check-up before. <br>
SEVEN: It is preferable to remaining here. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Voyager approaches a large pink and purple nebula.)<br>JANEWAY: What have we got here? <br>
KIM: Looks like a Mutara class nebula with a few trace constituents
that aren't in our database, but they're showing up in minute
quantities. <br>
TUVOK: The nebula is vast, Captain. It extends beyond the reach of our
sensors. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, then I guess we won't try to go around it. Tom, take us in
at one half impulse. <br>
PARIS: Yes, ma'am. <br>
KIM: I'm detecting a slight radioactive field. It's oh, oh.<br>

CHAKOTAY: Maybe you should go to Sickbay. <br>
KIM: Yeah, maybe so. <br>
PARIS: Captain! <br>(Then Tuvok is in pain as well. Kim is getting burns on his hands.) <br>KIM: Oh, god. <br>(The pain strikes Janeway and Chakotay.)<br>

EMH [OC]: Yes, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: We need help. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
I'm being inundated with calls. <br>

SEVEN: He's dead. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Astrometrics

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> SEVEN:
The nebula extends for at least one hundred ten light years. Possibly
more. <br>
JANEWAY: At the least, it would take us well over a month to get
through it, and more than a year to get around it. <br>
SEVEN: The crew was unable to tolerate the nebula for even a few
minutes. They certainly could not survive a month. <br>
JANEWAY: We've come fifteen thousand light years. We haven't been
stopped by temporal anomalies, warp core breaches, or hostile aliens.
And I am damned if I'm going to be stopped by a nebula. I'll be in
Sickbay. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
I've analysed a sample of the gases from the nebula. I think the damage
came from subnucleonic radiation. Even the briefest exposure is
devastating to organic tissue. <br>
JANEWAY: Can you give us any protection against the effects? <br>
EMH: Yes. Stasis chambers. Independent life support for each unit. <br>
JANEWAY: Are you suggesting that the entire crew be put in suspended
animation? <br>
EMH: Yes. I, of course, would stay online in order to monitor everyone.
<br>
JANEWAY: This is a drastic step, Doctor. Are there any other options?
Adjusting the shields? Inoculations? <br>
EMH: I assure you, I've considered all possibilities. This is the only
way. <br>
JANEWAY: There's more to getting through the nebula than monitoring the
crew. Who would regulate ship's systems? Make course adjustments? <br>
EMH: I think I've demonstrated that I have a command of the rudimentary
aspects of piloting. <br>
JANEWAY: Of course you have, and I know you could do it. But you'll
need back-up. We have no idea what effect the nebular radiation might
have on your holomatrix. What if you went offline? <br>
EMH: There was only one crewmember besides myself that seemed
unaffected by the nebula. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Cargo
Bay two]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: I want you to understand the seriousness of this
responsibility. The lives of the entire crew will be on your shoulders.
<br>
SEVEN: You doubt my ability to fulfil this task? <br>
JANEWAY: Ordinarily not at all, but this is an unusual situation. After
being in the Collective, it wasn't easy for you to adjust to a ship
with only a hundred and fifty people on it, was it, Seven? How would
you feel with only the Doctor for company? <br>
SEVEN: I will adapt. <br>
JANEWAY: Most humans don't react particularly well to long periods of
isolation. Borg Drones have even more difficulty. <br>
SEVEN: As you pointed out, I am neither Borg nor human. I can do this,
Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: All right. I'll work with the senior staff to draw up a list
of duties. But let me make it clear. The Doctor will be in command. You
will follow his instructions just as you would follow mine. <br>
SEVEN: Follow the orders of a hologram? <br>
JANEWAY: He's our Chief Medical Officer, and he is thoroughly grounded
in Starfleet protocols. You will report to him. <br>
SEVEN: I understand. </font></p>

room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
CHAKOTAY: The Doctor's preparing the stasis units now. They should be
ready by seventeen hundred hours. <br>
PARIS: And how long will this be for? <br>
JANEWAY: We don't know for certain. At least a month. Maybe longer, if
the nebula is larger than we estimate. <br>
TORRES: I've never been in long term stasis. Are there any side
effects? <br>
JANEWAY: The Doctor assures me it'll be just like taking a nap. We'll
go into the units, our cardiopulmonary systems will be slowed, neural
activity suspended, and we'll wake up feeling as though we'd had a good
night's sleep. <br>
KIM: There are things that can go wrong. At least, that's what I've
read. <br>
JANEWAY: We will be carefully monitored by Seven and the Doctor, who
will check our vital signs four times a day, and take care of any other
problems. <br>
PARIS: I assume that we've explored all the alternatives? <br>
JANEWAY: I think we're all feeling uneasy about this, and I'd be lying
if I said I don't have concerns myself. And I think it's about loss of
control. We always feel better if we think we're in charge of our own
circumstances. In stasis, we're giving up that control, and no
Starfleet officer likes to do that. But crews have been in stasis much
longer than a month. I think we can handle this. All right. You're free
until seventeen hundred hours. I'll make a ship-wide announcement when
the Doctor's ready. Dismissed. <br>(Chakotay remains.)<br>JANEWAY: Something else? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I want you to tell me that this isn't a mistake. <br>
JANEWAY: Your turn to get reassurance? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe. But my concern isn't about going into stasis. It's
about who you're leaving in charge. <br>
JANEWAY: You're worried about Seven. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe you need to step outside yourself for a minute. Look at
the fact that here's someone who's butted horns with you from the
moment she came on board. Who disregards authority and actively
disobeys orders when she doesn't agree with them. <br>
JANEWAY: And this is the person I'm giving responsibility for the lives
of this entire crew. I suppose you want me to tell you I'm not crazy? <br>
CHAKOTAY: In a nutshell. I know your bond with Seven is unique,
different from everyone else's. From the beginning, you've seen things
in her that no one else could. But maybe you could help me understand
some of those things. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't know if I can. It's just instinct. There's something
inside me that says she can be redeemed. In spite of her insolent
attitude, I honestly believe she wants to do well by us. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's good enough for me. <br>
JANEWAY: See you at seventeen hundred hours. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PARIS:
If I have to take a nap for a month, I really would rather do it in my
quarters. <br>
EMH: Everyone's being relocated here to deck fourteen so we can monitor
you more easily. Hop in. <br>
KIM: Come on, Tom. Sleepy time. <br>
PARIS: What if we had to get out in a hurry? <br>
JANEWAY: You can unlock the unit from inside, Tom. <br>
EMH: Do I detect a hint of claustrophobia, Lieutenant. <br>
PARIS: Why do they have to design these things like coffins? <br>
KIM: Should we replicate you a teddy bear? <br>
EMH: Sleep tight. <br>(Kim and Paris lie down, and the EMH closes the transparent lids over them.)<br>EMH: Have no worries, Captain. You'll go to sleep and the
next thing you know I'll be standing over you, telling you we're
through the nebula. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm leaving the ship in good hands. I have every confidence in
both of you. See you in a month. <br>(Janeway gets into her stasis chamber.)<br>

wandering. Leave it to Mister Paris to be just as much trouble now as
when he's awake. <br>

irritable and short-tempered with each passing day. <br>

little brush-up course in getting along with people. <br>

Try one, Commander. <br>

NEELIX: Join the party, Seven. It's no fun to stand there by yourself. <br>
SEVEN: I have no desire to have fun. <br>
NEELIX: No? <br>
SEVEN: I am attempting to recalibrate the warp field in order to resist
the nebula's radiation. I understand you have some knowledge of warp
field theory. Perhaps you could assist me. <br>
NEELIX: I'd be happy to give it a try. Let's see, the subspace field
matrix looks right. <br>
SEVEN: Captain.<br>JANEWAY: Excuse me. <br>SEVEN: Perhaps you could help as well. We're attempting to
find a stronger warp field calibration. <br>
JANEWAY: How interesting. Maybe if we vary the EM stress parameters,
the warp field dynamic would increase. <br>
NEELIX: Excellent idea, Captain. And if the warp coils were re-phased,
it would increase power to the nacelles. <br>
SEVEN: There is an additional problem. We must compensate for a
subspace induction drag on the engines. <br>
EMH: Pardon me, Captain, Mister Neelix. Computer, freeze programme.
You're completely missing the point of this exercise. You're supposed
to be mixing and mingling, not working on engineering problems. <br>
SEVEN: You ordered me to participate in this programme. You did not
specify topics of conversation. <br>
EMH: You're splitting hairs. You know very well what purpose this
programme is supposed to serve. <br>
SEVEN: I find that it serves no purpose whatsoever. <br>
EMH: Because you're being intentionally perverse. <br>
SEVEN: Holodecks are a pointless endeavour, fulfilling some human need
to fantasise. I have no such need. <br>
EMH: What you need is some editorial skill in your self-expression.
Between impulse and action there is a realm of good taste begging for
your acquaintance. <br>
SEVEN: I find your self-expression ponderous. <br>
EMH: And I can't put up with this for another month. <br>
SEVEN: We can arrange to avoid one another. <br>

me four times a day to keep me informed about the crew. <br>

TRAJIS: Borg? Never heard of them. Are you alone on this ship? <br>
SEVEN: No. The entire crew is here in stasis, and our Doctor is in
Sickbay. <br>
TRAJIS: I'm both pilot and crew on my ship. Fortunately, I happen to be
resistant to the effects of the nebula. <br>
SEVEN: What about your technology? The radiation is causing damage to
ours. <br>
TRAJIS: I've had to rebuild my engines twice already. If you've been in
the nebula for three weeks, you're doing well. <br>
SEVEN: I am hopeful our propulsion system will remain operational for
the next six days. <br>
TRAJIS: I'll admit I was surprised to find another ship headed toward
me. No one has ever managed to cross the nebula. <br>
SEVEN: If it weren't necessary, we wouldn't be attempting it. <br>
TRAJIS: I'm here by choice. I'm determined to be the first to get
through. I've tried five times before and failed, but this time I'm
sure I'll make it. I want to see what's on the other side. <br>
SEVEN: It is nothing remarkable. <br>
TRAJIS: But I'll be the first of my kind to see it. Tell me, how are
you handling the loneliness? <br>
SEVEN: What do you mean? <br>
TRAJIS: You know what I mean. No matter what you say, you're all alone
here. <br>
SEVEN: The microfusion chamber you requested. <br>
TRAJIS: I've heard that drones can't stand being alone. They're too
used to the Collective. <br>
SEVEN: How could you know that? <br>
TRAJIS: It's true, isn't it? <br>
SEVEN: You said you'd never heard of the Borg. <br>
TRAJIS: Don't be offended. I've got no grudge with them. <br>
SEVEN: You have what you asked for. Now leave. <br>
TRAJIS: I thought we could keep each other company for a while. Maybe
have something to eat. <br>
SEVEN: No. <br>
TRAJIS: And if I want to stay longer? <br>(Seven draws a phaser.)<br>
SEVEN: You will not be accommodated. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TRAJIS:
There's no need for this, you know. I mean you no harm. I think maybe
you're a little paranoid. That's what loneliness can do to you. You'd
be a lot better off to spend some time with me. We could get to
know each other. <br>
SEVEN: Quiet. <br>
PARIS [OC]: Seven, help me, Seven. <br>(Trajis has vanished. Seven runs and sees a shadow turning a corner.)<br>

TRAJIS [OC]:&nbsp;Seven of Nine. that's an unusual name. How did
you get it? Don't want to answer me? That's all right, I don't mind. I
know you're not yourself today. But you might be interested in what I'm
doing now. I know your sensors can't detect me. So if you want to know
where I am, you'll have to ask. Playing stubborn? That's a mistake. It
could lead to an unfortunate accident. Just to prove I'm willing to
give you a fair chance, I'll ask you. What would happen if the
structural integrity around the warp coils collapsed? You wouldn't have
much time to keep them from rupturing.<br>(Seven runs.) </font></p>

TRAJIS [OC]: Finally. I'm glad you're responding. It's going to be much
more interesting if we play this game together. <br>
SEVEN: Your location. <br>
TRAJIS [OC]: A long way from you. On the bridge. Command centre of your

TRAJIS [OC]: Of course. Do you think I'd leave now? <br>
SEVEN: I'm enjoying this game. What's next? <br>
TRAJIS [OC]: That's better. Well, let's just imagine that one of the
photon torpedoes was activated but not ejected. <br>
SEVEN: I would have to get to the torpedo bay quickly. <br>
TRAJIS [OC]: Even then you might be too late. But of course you
have to try. <br>
SEVEN: Let's play another game. Let's imagine that the oxygen on the bridge has been depleted. <br>

me. You're too weak. <br>
SEVEN: Don't come any closer. <br>
TRAJIS: You couldn't stand being alone, could you? You felt vulnerable,
afraid. Because you know what you are. <br>
SEVEN: Stop. <br>

that's impossible, don't you? You're Borg. That's what you were meant
to be. <br>(The warp core glow turns Borg green.)<br>TRAJIS: One of many. But your days of power are gone. You're alone now.
Weak. Pathetic. <br>

EMH: There was no one else in this room. <br>(Seven gives the rifle to the EMH.)<br>
SEVEN: You mean I imagined him? <br>
EMH: Yes. <br>
SEVEN: I heard Lieutenant Paris call for help. I saw him and the
others. Did I imagine them as well? <br>
EMH: I believe so. When I studied the gel pack, I discovered the
radiation was producing a degradation in the synaptic relays. I'm
guessing there's been a similar effect on your Borg implants. The
radiation could be altering the neurotransmitter levels in your sensory
nodes. That would explain why you're hearing voices, seeing images. <br>
SEVEN: They seemed real. <br>
EMH: Hallucinations usually are. That's what makes them so frightening.
<br>
SEVEN: Once, when I was a drone, I was separated from the Collective
for two hours. I experienced panic and apprehension. I am feeling that
way now. <br>
EMH: I'll do everything I can to help you. We'll get you to Sickbay. An
antipsychotic may help, at least until I determine just what neural
functions are being affected. <br>(A console goes bang!)<br>
SEVEN: What was that? <br>
