permission to depart upper pylon one in three minutes. <br>
KIRA: We have an incoming Bolian vessel at coordinates one zero one
mark three eight. Give the Bok'Nor a clear trajectory out of the
traffic pattern. <br>
DAX: Acknowledged. <br>
KIRA: Feel like getting together for dinner tonight? <br>
DAX: Can't. I'm having dinner with Captain Boday. <br>
KIRA: The Gallamite? You're going out on a date with him? <br>
DAX: Is something wrong with that? <br>
KIRA: No. Not at all. <br>
DAX: He happens to be brilliant. His brain is twice the size of yours
and mine. <br>
KIRA: I know. I've seen it. <br>
DAX: It's not his fault Gallamites have transparent skulls. <br>
KIRA: No, it's not. It's not exactly the view I want to have with
dinner. <br>
DAX: You know, Kira, sometimes I think you place too much emphasis on
how men look. <br>
KIRA: What's that supposed to mean? <br>
DAX: Nothing. <br>
KIRA: Look, when I kiss a man goodnight, I like to know where I'm
kissing him. <br>
DAX: I guess seven lifetimes gives me a somewhat broader perspective. <br>
KIRA: Since I have just one lifetime, I have to be a little more
particular about whom I go out with. <br>
DAX: I never said I wasn't particular. <br>
KIRA: I'm not the one who dates Ferengis. <br>
DAX: And what's that supposed to mean? <br>
KIRA: Nothing. <br>
DAX: Releasing docking clamps at upper pylon one. That's funny. I'm
picking up elevated. DS Nine to Bok'Nor. Shut down your engines!
Repeat, shut down your engines! <br>
(KaBOOM) <br>
KIRA: Report! <br>
DAX: Some kind of impulse overload. Checking. <br>
KIRA: Ops to all engineering personnel. Report to rescue stations. We
have an S I D in progress. <br>
DAX: There's nothing left of it. There's no one left to rescue. </font></p>

there. All materials commonly used in Cardassian ship construction. <br>
KIRA: Maybe it was a malfunction in the impulse generator. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'd like to be able to tell you that, Major, but it's too soon
to be sure. <br>
KIRA: I can't believe the Cardassians have waited this long for an
official explanation. <br>
SISKO [on monitor]: Anything, Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: No sign of an explosive device yet, sir. <br>
SISKO [on monitor]: I've got every Admiral within subspace range on my
back. Can I at least tell them that it looks like an accident? <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, I wouldn't do that yet. <br>
SISKO [on monitor]: When? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll let you know, sir. <br>
KIRA: Anything from the Cardassians, Commander? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Ops]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Not a word. <br>
ODO: All Bajoran outposts have been put on alert for retaliatory
strikes. The provisional government has made a statement disavowing any
responsibility. <br>
KIRA [on viewscreen]: Maybe it really was an accident. I mean, it is a
possibility. <br>
ODO: An accident involving a Cardassian ship in Bajoran space? If I
were a Cardassian, I wouldn't easily accept <br>
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: That's odd. <br>
SISKO: What? <br>
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: I'm picking up traces of a mercassium
compound. <br>
DAX: Mercassium? There shouldn't have been any mercassium on board that
ship. <br>
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: Well, there was. <br>
SISKO: Meaning? <br>
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: I'm not quite sure yet. <br>
ODO: Is mercassium some kind of explosive? <br>
SISKO: No, it's a synthetic composite used in shield generator
construction by the Federation. We don't share that technology with
anyone. <br>
DAX: Chief, I don't think you're going to find evidence of an explosive
device. <br>
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: Lieutenant, respectfully, these kinds of
things take time and I've got to <br>
DAX: I don't think you're going to find an explosive device because I'm
pretty sure it was an implosive proto-matter device designed to match
the impulse signature. Just before the explosion, I picked up a sudden
increase in their fusion rate. I'm trying to find any sign of
malfunction in the Bok'Nor's engines to explain it but there just isn't
one. This doesn't look like an accident. The fusion shock had to be
caused by something external to the impulse drive system. <br>
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: If a proto-matter device was attached to the
crossfeeds, that could have created the overload and we'd never see any
sign of it. <br>
SISKO: Can you prove that's what happened? <br>
O'BRIEN [on viewscreen]: Maybe. If we could get a high resolution
spectra of the impulse debris. But that's going to take some <br>
SISKO: Time. Yes, I know. Get it started. I'll tell the Admirals. Sisko
out. <br>
(Cal Hudson arrives on the turbolift.) <br>
HUDSON: Benjamin. <br>
SISKO: Cal. Thanks for coming on such short notice. <br>
HUDSON: I wish it didn't take a disaster like this to get us back
together. <br>
DAX: Hi, Calvin. <br>
SISKO: Jadzia Dax. <br>
HUDSON: Dax? My goodness. You look a lot better than the last time I
saw you. <br>
SISKO: Chief of Security Odo. Lieutenant Commander Calvin Hudson,
Starfleet's attach√©
to the Federation colonies in the new Demilitarised Zone. <br>
ODO: You must be concerned about the colonies' security at a time like
this. <br>
HUDSON: Well, we haven't noticed any unusual deployment from the
Cardassians along the border. <br>
ODO: Neither have we, and that's what's got me worried. <br>
SISKO: Let's go into my office. <br>
HUDSON: Lieutenant, I don't have time this trip, but you and I have a
few stories to catch up on. <br>
DAX: Next time. <br>
HUDSON: Next time.

woman ever has. More than my wife, even. <br>
SISKO: Tell me about it. <br>

SISKO: She's not Curzon. <br>
HUDSON: Now, you two aren't? I mean <br>

SISKO: Oh, no. She may not be Curzon, but she is Dax. <br>
HUDSON: Yes, that would be extremely strange. So, Ben, how is Jake? <br>
SISKO: As tall as me. <br>
HUDSON: No. <br>
SISKO: He throws inside to knock the old man off the plate. <br>
HUDSON: A little chin music, huh? <br>
SISKO: He's growing up too fast. <br>
HUDSON: It must have been difficult for you. At least I didn't have a
child to raise by myself. <br>
SISKO: Well, we kind of helped each other through it. When I heard
about Gretchen, I wanted to be there for you. There was just no way to
get back. <br>
HUDSON: I know that, Ben. You know, I was hoping when they sent me to
the colonies that you and I would have time for some R and R together. <br>
SISKO: Who's got R and R time? <br>
HUDSON: I know. You can't imagine how my life has changed since the
Federation abandoned these colonies. <br>
SISKO: Abandoned them? Doesn't your presence there <br>
HUDSON: My presence there is a joke. I am supposed to help these
colonies function under the terms of the new treaty. Now Ben, what the
hell does that mean? <br>
SISKO: I thought these colonists wanted to stay. That they refused to
evacuate. <br>
HUDSON: The treaty gave away their territory to the Cardassians,
territory that these people had invested their lives in. Now, Ben, if
you knew them as I do, you'd know why they can't leave. It's a bad
treaty. The Federation gave away too much. <br>
SISKO: Several Cardassian colonies wanted to stay on the Federation
side of the Zone too. It seemed like a reasonable compromise <br>
HUDSON: Well, yes, the Cardassians would love to have their colonies in
our territory. Because they knew we'd protect them. But they have no
intention of doing the same for ours. <br>
SISKO: A number of Admirals at Starfleet Command are worried the
destruction of the Bok'Nor might jeopardise the treaty. <br>
HUDSON: Oh, are they really? <br>
SISKO: As the two ranking officers along the Cardassian border, we've
been asked to assess the potential risk. <br>
HUDSON: There is no risk, Ben. None. I have been dealing with the
Cardassians most of my professional life, and believe me, they are very
pleased with what they got from the treaty. They are not about to risk
all they've gained by sending forces into the Zone. They're much too
slick for that. If I were you, I'd be very concerned with security
along the Bajoran border. <br>
SISKO: Are you surprised they haven't responded at all yet? <br>
HUDSON: Well, Ben, you and I both know they never let you see what you
expect to see. They'll respond.
