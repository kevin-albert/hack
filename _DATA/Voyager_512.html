NAOMI: Is it going to hurt? <br>
EMH: Of course not. A few photons never hurt anybody. <br>

holo-imager could be in the pursuit of medical knowledge. <br>

EMH: Your health is excellent. This is just another way to make sure
that it stays excellent. <br>
NAOMI: Does my mother have to do this? <br>
EMH: Your mother and everybody else on board. I made it part of the
annual
check-up. It's quite handy, really. By attuning the resonance spectrum
along the subspace band I can take an image of my patients all the way
down to the subatomic level. <br>

from the inside out. <br>

EMH: Here we go. (First Kim's skeleton appears, then his internal organs, blood vessels, muscles, skin and uniform.)<br>
KIM: Handsome fellow. <br>
EMH: There's some scar tissue along the base of your lower skull.
Computer, isolate the occipital plexus, magnification five hundred.
There. Scarring along the dura mater. <br>
KIM: From what? <br>
EMH: An operation. Computer, isolate the cranial meninges,
magnification one hundred. More scarring. No doubt about it. Somebody
performed neurosurgery. And that somebody was me.These microlinear
incisions are a dead giveaway. I developed that procedure myself. <br>
KIM: I don't understand. I don't remember having an operation. <br>

it.

EMH [OC]: The Doctor. <br>
JANEWAY: Come in. <br>
EMH: I've finished giving the crew their annual physicals, but as usual
the Captain was a no-show. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's get it over with. <br>
EMH: Specific complaints? <br>
JANEWAY: None. How's the crew? <br>
EMH: In good health, for the most part. I found a nascent alien
retrovirus bouncing between personnel on decks ten and eleven, but
managed to nip it in the bud. And there's been a little more wear and
tear on Seven of Nine's cranial infrastructure. I'm going to double her
maintenance routine. Cytometabolism is normal. Endocrine functions
functioning. <br>
JANEWAY: That's a relief. <br>
EMH: I'd like you to drop by Sickbay at your earliest convenience. I've
adjusted my holo-imager for deep body scans. You're the only member of
the crew who hasn't posed for me yet. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe next week. <br>
EMH: It's a fine instrument, really. I've already discovered something
of a mystery with it. Apparently, I performed a complex neurosurgery on
Harry Kim. According to the isotope decay around the scars, it was
eighteen months ago. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't remember that. <br>
EMH: Neither do I, and neither does the patient. I checked my medical
entries for that period. There's no mention of surgery. <br>
JANEWAY: Could your holo-imager have misinterpreted the scans? <br>
EMH: Possibly. The computer is double-checking the data now. I'd also
like to run a complete diagnostic on my own programme and have a look
at my memory files. <br>
JANEWAY: B'Elanna and Harry are both busy with the plasma relay
repairs. Let's make sure you're next up on the list. Thank you, Doctor.

EMH: A little mystery has cropped up. Evidence that I performed surgery
on Ensign Kim a year and a half ago, before you came aboard. The

SEVEN: You don't recall speaking to me in the Astrometrics lab one hour

SEVEN: A deletion in your short term memory buffer. <br>
EMH: Our chat in Astrometrics never got filed. That's why I can't
remember it. If I were given to paranoia, I'd say someone is trying to
keep me from finding out what happened eighteen months ago. My photo

didn't record an image for posterity. Let's have a walk down memory

EMH: No, they're real. The image buffer would have shown signs of
tampering. I have a different theory. I believe there was an attack on
Voyager by this species and all our memories of the event were erased.
This is the unknown crewman I told you about. Ensign Jetal. The
question is, who was she? An alien intruder posing as a Starfleet
Ensign? Of course, it's impossible to tell from a photograph, but one
thing is certain. We are in immediate danger. <br>
TUVOK: How so? <br>
EMH: Only a few hours ago, as I was beginning this investigation,
someone shut down my programme and eliminated all my memories of the

have been the only one who was injured during the attack. <br>

broke the sand and the referee gave the match to Kar-pek. <br>

Come in. Are you having a little trouble regenerating? <br>
SEVEN: My alcove is functioning properly. I am having trouble with the

JANEWAY: There's a time and a place for philosophical discussion. Two
in the morning in my quarters isn't one of them. But I'll tell you
what. Meet me in the mess hall tomorrow. <br>
SEVEN: Tomorrow will be too late. We'll have already rewritten the

JANEWAY: And violated his rights as an individual. <br>
SEVEN: Precisely. <br>
JANEWAY: If you've come to act as my conscience, you're a little late.
I considered these issues eighteen months ago, as I did again this
morning. I came to the same conclusion. <br>
SEVEN: Your conclusion is wrong. <br>
JANEWAY: Coffee, black. (she takes a sip.) Lukewarm. Now I've told that replicator a dozen
times about the temperature of my coffee. It just doesn't seem to want
to listen. Almost as if it's got a mind of its own. But it doesn't. A
replicator operates through a series of electronic pathways that allow
it to receive instructions and take appropriate action, and there you
go. A cup of coffee, a bowl of soup, a plasma conduit, whatever we tell
it to do. As difficult as it is to accept, the Doctor is more like that
replicator than he is like us. <br>
SEVEN: He would disagree. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sure he would, but I can't let that change my decision. I
learned that the hard way when his programme almost self-destructed. I
won't take that risk again. <br>
SEVEN: The risk isn't yours to take. <br>
JANEWAY: If one of my crew chose to put a phaser to his own head,
should I let him? <br>
SEVEN: It would depend on the situation. <br>
JANEWAY: It always depends on the situation, Seven, but we can debate
philosophy another time. <br>
SEVEN: When you separated me from the Collective, I was an unknown risk
to your crew, yet you kept me on board. You allowed me to evolve into
an individual. <br>
JANEWAY: You're a human being. He's a hologram. <br>
SEVEN: And you allowed that hologram to evolve as well, to exceed his
original programming. And yet now you choose to abandon him. <br>
JANEWAY: Objection noted. Good night. <br>
SEVEN: It is unsettling. You say that I am a human being and yet I am
also Borg. Part of me not unlike your replicator. Not unlike the
Doctor. Will you one day choose to abandon me as well? I have always
looked to you as my example, my guide to humanity. Perhaps I've been
mistaken. Good night.

systems. We've got to stabilise their synapses. Get me a choline
compound. <br>
PARIS: Which choline compound? <br>
EMH: It doesn't matter. Just make sure it's a pure base. Her spinal
cord's deteriorating. (He checks Kim.) Same rate of collapse. <br>
PARIS: Acetylcholine, twenty five microlitres. It's not helping. I'm
reading massive synaptic failure. <br>
EMH: This doesn't make any sense. <br>
PARIS: Paris to Engineering. Transfer all available power to Sickbay. <br>
TORRES [OC]: Acknowledged. <br>
EMH: Some kind of plasmic energy is arcing between their neural
membranes. That weapon, it was designed to do this. <br>
PARIS: To leave a residual charge in the victim's body? <br>
EMH: An energy pulse that remains in the neural membranes, working its
way up the spinal cord to the brain. They'll be dead in minutes if
we don't find a way to stop it. I've got to protect their brain
functions. <br>
PARIS: His neocortex is failing. <br>
EMH: A spinal shunt. I'll isolate the spinal cord from the brain stem
until I can repair the cellular damage. But I don't have time to
perform the procedure on both of them. <br>
PARIS: Then talk me through it. We'll do them together. <br>
EMH: It's too complex. <br>
PARIS: Then make a choice, before we lose them both! <br>(The EMH choses Kim.)<br>
EMH: Subdermal scalpel. Bio-electric field generator. <br>
PARIS: His vital signs are stabilising. It's working. <br>
EMH: Cellular regenerator. His neural membranes are re-establishing
themselves. Good. (The biobed behind them signals Jetal's death.) </font></p>

attack, how did it end? Were there more casualties? <br>
JANEWAY: We exchanged fire for another few minutes, then the aliens
withdrew. There was only one casualty. Ensign Jetal. <br>

loss of a patient with professional detachment.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
We are assembled here today to pay final respects to our honoured dead,
Ensign Ahni Jetal. Her intelligence and her charm have made our long
journey home seem not quite so long. As she continues on a journey of
her own, we will keep her in our hearts and in our memories.<br>(Tuvok fires Jetal's torpedo casing coffin into space.)

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH:
We're low on synthetic antigens, and I'm sorry to report many of the
medicinal plants you've collected over the past several months were
destroyed as well. <br>
NEELIX: I have some herbs in storage you might be able to use. <br>
EMH: Been holding out on me? <br>
NEELIX: No, I was keeping them around just in case. <br>
EMH: Good planning. <br>
NEELIX: As for the antigens, I'll have to start replicating them in
batches. Which do you want first? <br>
EMH: Decisions, decisions. How do you make a decision, Mister Neelix?
In general, I mean. <br>
NEELIX: I guess I weigh the alternatives and try to decide which is
best. <br>(The EMH picks up two fruit. One red, one yellow.)<br>
EMH: Which is best. How do you determine that? <br>
NEELIX: I never thought about it, really. <br>
EMH: Well, maybe you should. Think about it, I mean. <br>
NEELIX: I guess every situation is a little different. <br>
EMH: For me, it's rather simple. While I'm faced with a decision, my
programme calculates the variables, and I take action. For example,
what could be simpler than a triage situation in Sickbay? Two patients,
for example, both injured, for example, both in imminent danger of
dying. Calculate the variables. My programme needs to ascertain which
patient has the greater chance of survival, and that's the one I treat. <br>(He throws the red fruit across the room.)<br>EMH: Simple. But, what if they have an equal chance of survival? What then?
Hmm? Flip a coin? Pick a card? <br>
NEELIX: Doctor. <br>
EMH: Oh, I'm all right. I'm a hologram. I don't get injured, I don't
feel pain, I don't die. Unlike some people I could tell you about. For
example, two patients. Both injured, both in imminent danger of. Don't
touch me! I'm a hologram. Photonic energy. Don't waste your time. <br>
NEELIX: Neelix to Security. Send a team to the Mess hall, please. <br>
EMH: A whole team, Mister Neelix? Throwing a little party, are we? Why,
I attended a party just recently. A birthday party for a very nice
young woman. I made a decision there, too. Several of them, in fact.
When I came through the door, do I turn right or do I turn left? As I
recall, I decided on the latter. Then, what should I see before me but
the hors d'oeuvre tray, and another decision. Do I take a canapé or
refuse? Oh, that's an easy one. I'm a hologram. I don't eat. <br>(Tuvok and security arrive.)<br>
NEELIX: Something's wrong with him. <br>
EMH: Don't you know it's rude to refer to somebody in the third person.
You had a choice, Mister Neelix. Should I do something rude or not do
something rude? <br>
TUVOK: Doctor, we must return to Sickbay. <br>
EMH: Why should I? What if I don't want to return to Sickbay? What if I
decide not to return to Sickbay? No, I don't choose this. Leave me
alone! Let me go! Why did she have to die? Why did I kill her? Why did
I decide to kill her? Why? Somebody tell me why!

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
It was downhill from there. You developed a feedback loop between your
ethical and cognitive subroutines. You were having the same thoughts
over and over again. We couldn't stop it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
TORRES: Our only option was to erase your memories of those events. <br>
EMH: You were right. I didn't deserve to keep those memories, not after
what I did. <br>
JANEWAY: You were performing your duty. <br>
EMH: Two patients, which do I kill? <br>
JANEWAY: Doctor.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
EMH: Doctor? Hardly! A doctor retains his objectivity. I didn't do
that, did I? Two patients, equal chances of survival and I chose the
one I was closer to? I chose my friend? That's not in my programming!
That's not what I was designed to do! Go ahead! Reprogramme me! I'll lend
you a hand! Let's start with this very day, this hour, this second! <br>
JANEWAY: Computer, deactivate the EMH. <br>
TORRES: Here we go again. Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: It's as though there's a battle being fought inside him,
between his original programming and what he's become. Our solution was
to end that battle. What if we were wrong? <br>
TORRES: We've seen what happens to him. In fact, we've seen it twice. <br>
JANEWAY: Still, we allowed him to evolve, and at the first sign of
trouble? We gave him a soul, B'Elanna. Do we have the right to take it
away now? <br>
TORRES: We gave him personality subroutines. I'd hardly call that a
soul.

JANEWAY: I'm having trouble with the nature of individuality. <br>
SEVEN: You require a philosophical discussion? <br>
JANEWAY: There's a time and a place for it. This is one of them. After
I freed you from the Collective, you were transformed. It's been a
difficult process. Was it worth it? <br>
SEVEN: I had no choice. <br>
JANEWAY; That's not what I asked you. <br>

I? No.

EMH: The primordial atom burst, sending out its radiation, setting
everything in motion. One particle collides with another, gases expand,
planets contract, and before you know it we've got starships and
holodecks and chicken soup. In fact, you can't help but have starships
and holodecks and chicken soup, because it was all determined twenty
billion years ago! &nbsp;<br>(Tuvok enters during this outburst.)<br>
TUVOK: There is a certain logic to your logic. Progress? <br>

JANEWAY: Poetry, written on Earth a thousand years ago. La Vita Nuova. <br>
EMH: La Vita Nuova. The New Life? Ha! Tell that to Ensign Jetal.
Actually, I killed her countless times. <br>
JANEWAY: What do you mean? <br>
EMH: Causality, probability. For every action, there's an infinite
number of reactions and in each one of them, I killed her. Or did I?
Too many possibilities. Too many pathways for my programme to follow.
Impossible to choose. Still, I can't live with the knowledge of
what I've done. I can't. <br>(Janeway has fallen asleep.)<br>EMH: Captain? Captain? <br>
