CHAKOTAY: Beautiful, isn’t it? <br>
SEVEN: A sensor analysis would have provided the necessary information.
<br>
CHAKOTAY: Just admiring the view. <br>
SEVEN: The conference begins in less than an hour. <br>
CHAKOTAY: There’s always time for Warp Field Dynamics, but you don’t
see natural beauty like this every day. <br>(Whumph)<br>CHAKOTAY: What was that? <br>
SEVEN: Some kind of energy barrier directly below us. It spans
thousands of square kilometres. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Why didn’t our sensors detect it? <br>
SEVEN: Uncertain. It has an unusual tetrion signature. Species three
one two used a similar technology. There’s a power surge coming from
the barrier. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Shields at full. <br>
SEVEN: They’re creating some kind of feedback. We’ve lost impulse
engines. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Go to warp. <br>
SEVEN: The warp core is offline. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Warp engines don’t just shut down when you scrape an energy
barrier. <br>
SEVEN: It’s affecting all our systems. <br>
COMPUTER: Warning. Structural failure in thirty seconds. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We’ll have to beam to the surface. <br>
SEVEN: We can’t transport through the barrier. Transfer auxiliary power
to the weapons array. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What are you trying to do? <br>
SEVEN: If I can realign our phasers to the correct frequency, I may be
able to open a rift. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Big enough to get a shuttle through, I hope? <br>
COMPUTER: Warning. Structural failure in ten seconds, nine, eight. <br>
SEVEN: Phasers reconfigured.<br>(Chakotay
fires the phaser and flies the shuttlecraft through the resulting hole.
They lose the nacelles as they go through, and beam out as the
shuttlecraft tumbles to the ground.)

SEVEN: You have a hairline fracture. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We've got bigger problems. I’ll be fine. <br>
SEVEN: I’m detecting shuttle debris scattered over several square
kilometres. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Some of it might still be functional. <br>
SEVEN: If we can find the right components, we may be able to construct
a beacon. Send a distress signal. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Through the barrier? <br>
SEVEN: Maybe. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If we hurry we might still make that conference. Well, if we
have to be stranded somewhere, we couldn’t ask for a nicer place. <br>

SEVEN: I may have found a way of communicating. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Me too. I've learned to say thank you. <br>(He demonstrates. The girl is watching Seven.)<br>SEVEN: I was referring to communication with Voyager. It may be
possible to construct a beacon by connecting these components to the
shuttle's deflector. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Did you find it? <br>
SEVEN: I detected it six kilometres from here. I believe it's intact. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm not sure I'm up to that long a trip. <br>
SEVEN: I'll go. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I've started mapping the area. Here's the river we passed. This is where we beamed down. And we're here now. <br>
SEVEN: Then the deflector should be approximately here. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Six kilometres is a long way. Maybe one of them could guide
you. <br>
SEVEN: I'm still trying to limit our contact with these people. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The sooner you get to the deflector, the sooner we can get
out of here. They know the terrain. Maybe they can get you there
faster. <br>

goodbye. <br>

JANEWAY: That’s awfully low for something to be in orbit. <br>
TUVOK: It’s not in orbit. It’s resting on an energy barrier. <br>
KIM: We think the shuttle may have collided with it. <br>
JANEWAY: Why didn’t they see it? <br>
TUVOK: Standard scans didn’t reveal its presence. We were only able to
detect it with our Borg sensors. <br>
JANEWAY: If all you found was a wing, maybe the rest of the shuttle
made it through the barrier. <br>
TUVOK: Logic suggests that possibility. Unfortunately, the barrier's
deflecting all our scans. There’s no way to know if the shuttle or its

AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: It shields the territory of an indigenous
society, the Ventu. <br>

could scan for our people’s lifesigns. <br>
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: I’m afraid we can’t do that. <br>
JANEWAY: Why not? <br>

ago. They haven’t been back. The technology is a mystery to us. <br>
TUVOK: Why did these aliens build the barrier? <br>
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: To protect the Ventu. <br>
JANEWAY: From whom? <br>
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: Us. Our ancestors fought them, polluted
their habitat. I’m afraid we weren’t very enlightened back then. <br>
JANEWAY: Earth went through its dark periods too, Ambassador. Would you
have any objections if we tried to lower the barrier, just to scan for
our people? <br>

JANEWAY: If Seven were here, she might be able to figure out a way to
get through it. <br>

caused by feedback from the shuttle’s phasers. <br>
JANEWAY: Seven and Chakotay might have used them to penetrate the barrier
for some reason. <br>

approximately four point eight kilometres in that direction. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Can you transmit the signal from there? <br>
SEVEN: Not through the barrier, but I may be able to neutralise it by
generating a dampening field with our deflector. <br>

SEVEN: Some of them could help us. <br>

from the shuttle, using it to imitate us. I don’t want them helping. <br>
SEVEN: What’s the alternative? Staying here? Allowing them to find all
of the debris? If we neutralise the barrier, Voyager can transport us
and our technology off the surface. <br>

disrupt the barrier permanently? <br>

TUVOK: A torpedo shouldn’t create any. Theoretically. <br>

JANEWAY [OC]: Is there a problem? <br>
SEVEN: Someone’s been injured. She requires medical attention. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Do you need the Doctor? <br>

your curiosity, but you should be more careful. It’s time for me to
leave. <br>(Seven gestures goodbye, the girl replies where?)<br>SEVEN: Back to my home. <br>(The girl offers her the blanket.) <br>SEVEN: That’s very

Catalogue those foliates. <br>

BARUS: Oh. You must be from Voyager. <br>
SEVEN: Who are you? <br>
BARUS:: My name is Barus. I’m the expedition leader. <br>
SEVEN: What kind of expedition are you leading? <br>
BARUS: We’re conducting scans to evaluate the potential of this
habitat. <br>
SEVEN: Potential for what? <br>
BARUS: Anthropological research, resource development. We’ve been
waiting years for this. <br>
SEVEN: What about the people who live here? <br>
BARUS: We’ll help them, of course. <br>
SEVEN: How? <br>
BARUS: With medicine, infrastructure, education. Whoever lowered this
barrier did the Ventu a great favour. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CHAKOTAY:
That barrier has to go back up. <br>
SEVEN: Isn’t it possible the Ledosians will improve the lives of the
Ventu? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Improve them? How? <br>
SEVEN: They’re intelligent people. Exposure to education and technology
may give them better opportunities. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Can you honestly say that you know what’s better for them? <br>
SEVEN: No, I can’t. <br>
JANEWAY: Then what do you think we should do? <br>
SEVEN: I’m uncertain. <br>
JANEWAY: It’s not like you to be on the fence. <br>
SEVEN: When Commander Chakotay and I first encountered the Ventu, I
found them primitive, of little interest to me. But as I spent time
with them, I came to realise that they’re a resourceful, self-reliant
people. Their isolation may limit their potential, but if that
isolation ends, so will a unique way of life.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">AMBASSADOR
[on viewscreen]: We appreciate your help in opening this territory to
exploration, Captain. It’s an unprecedented opportunity. <br>
JANEWAY: A short-lived opportunity, I’m afraid. <br>
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: I don’t understand. <br>
JANEWAY: After I transport our deflector back to Voyager, the energy
barrier will go back up. <br>
TUVOK: Naturally, you’ll want to get your people out, so they won’t be
trapped inside as ours were. <br>
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: You have no right to limit our access to
our own territory. <br>
JANEWAY: I’m not trying to do that, but we have a strict policy about
leaving our technology in the hands of other cultures. It often has
damaging consequences. <br>
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: I don’t think you realise how important
this is. It’s not only the resources that interest us. The Ventu are
our evolutionary ancestors. Our living history. <br>
JANEWAY: I understand this is disappointing for you, but I’m afraid I
have no choice. <br>
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: In the spirit of cooperation, I hope
you'll reconsider. <br>
JANEWAY: We’re eager to resume course. Would an hour be enough time to
evacuate your people? <br>

We’ve transported all the remaining debris to the Cargo Bay. <br>
SEVEN: I have a lock on the deflector assembly. <br>
JANEWAY: What is it? <br>
TUVOK: There’s a Ledosian vessel on an intercept course. It’s charging
weapons. <br>
JANEWAY: Shields! <br>
TUVOK: Direct hit to the transporters. They’re offline. <br>
JANEWAY: Get a weapons lock and hail them. <br>
KIM: They’re hailing us. <br>
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: Captain Janeway. <br>
JANEWAY: What's going on? <br>
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: Our government has decided not to let you
restore the barrier. <br>
JANEWAY: And that justifies an unprovoked attack? <br>
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: We only targeted your transporters to avoid
harming your crew. I hope you’ll show the same restraint. <br>
JANEWAY: I don’t find weapons fire of any kind restrained. <br>
AMBASSADOR [on viewscreen]: If you want to avoid further conflict, I
suggest you leave. <br>(Transmission ends.)<br>

the opportunity to scan my deflector modifications. In time, they may
find a way to duplicate our technology and remove the barrier
themselves. <br>
