WORF: Commander, is it your intention to continue to grow your beard? <br>
LAFORGE: Actually, I'm not sure yet. Why, Worf? <br>
WORF: I am just asking. <br>
CRUSHER: Seven card stud, one-eyed jacks are wild. <br>
RIKER: Frankly, Geordi, I like the beard. <br>
LAFORGE: Thank you, Commander. <br>
CRUSHER: You know, I have always been a little suspicious of men with
beards. <br>
WORF: Why is that? <br>
CRUSHER: I don't know. It's as if they're trying to hide something. <br>
RIKER: Hide? Don't be ridiculous, Doctor. The beard is an ancient and
proud tradition. <br>
LAFORGE: Some of the most distinguished men in history have worn
beards, Doctor. <br>
CRUSHER: I know. But after the razor was invented I think beards became
mostly a fashion statement. <br>
WORF: I'm not concerned with fashion. To a Klingon, a beard is a symbol
of courage. <br>
RIKER: I think it's a sign of strength. <br>
CRUSHER: Sure, and of course, women can't grow beards. <br>
LAFORGE: Doctor, it sounds to me like you feel beards are nothing more
than an affectation. <br>
CRUSHER: I do. But there's nothing wrong with that. I mean, women wear
makeup and nail polish. I just think it's time you men admitted it. <br>
RIKER: My beard is not an affectation. <br>
CRUSHER: Oh? Well then you wouldn't mind shaving it off. <br>
RIKER: I could lose it in a minute. I've just gotten used to it. <br>
CRUSHER: Okay, then why don't we up the stakes a little? And if I win,
all off you shave your beards off. <br>
LAFORGE: Wait a minute, wait a minute. What if you lose? What are you
going to give up? <br>
CRUSHER: I'm open for suggestions. <br>
RIKER: Well, I've always wanted to see you as a brunette. <br>
CRUSHER: Oh, I did that once when I was thirteen. I couldn't change
back fast enough. <br>
RIKER: That makes me even more curious. <br>
CRUSHER: Fine. If one of you wins, I become a brunette. Are we on? <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, yeah, we'll take that bet. <br>

been fraught with problems, and is well behind schedule. Mister La

of blue energy going down to the surface) <br>
LAFORGE: Doctor Farallon. The original design called for the particle
fountain to lift five hundred kilograms per minute from the surface. So
far we haven't come close to that. <br>
FARALLON: (an alien lady) Well, that's why I want to increase the
stream density. That should boost the lift capacity by seventy two
percent. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, but you realise of course you're going to be overloading
the field generators in the process. <br>
FARALLON: Not if we distribute the overload evenly throughout the
system. <br>
LAFORGE: Doctor, forgive me, but maybe we should concentrate on
completing this phase of the project before we start talking about re
designing it. <br>
FARALLON: Commander, I know you're here to evaluate this project. <br>
LAFORGE: Starfleet is considering using a particle fountain on Carema
Three. They want to know how feasible it is. <br>
FARALLON: And will your opinion be the deciding factor? <br>
LAFORGE: No, not really. I'll make my report to Captain Picard. He'll
make the official recommendation to Starfleet. They'll decide. <br>
FARALLON: What's your feeling so far? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, it seems to me the question we should be asking is, is
this technology is more efficient than conventional mining techniques? <br>
FARALLON: Commander I know we've had problems here. It seems like
nothing's gone right. It's taking a lot longer than I thought to get
the particle stream to full strength. But I know it can work. This is
the direction that mining is going to take in the future, and it should
be implemented on Carema Three. <br>
LAFORGE: I know this can be potentially very exciting. <br>
FARALLON: All right, I want to show you something I've been working on.
Something that might help us complete this project more quickly. I've
used these on a limited basis <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: La Forge here. We have a malfunction in
one of the power grids. We're losing particle stream confinement. <br>
DATA [OC]: Do you require assistance? <br>
LAFORGE: Stand by. I'm sorry, Doctor, I think we're going to have to
shut it down. <br>
FARALLON: It took four months to get the particle flux up to this
level. If we shut down, it'll take another four months just to get it
back. <br>
LAFORGE: Look, e have less than five minutes before we lose
confinement. When that happens, the particle stream is going to flood
this entire station. We're going to have to shut it down then anyway. <br>
FARALLON: Then we'll just have to fix the power grid. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, bow do we do that? The defective grid is two hundred
metres down conduit A two.
We have to disassemble four bulkheads just to get to it. <br>
FARALLON: Well here's the perfect opportunity to show you what I had in
mind. <br>
(she picks up a device and puts it in the conduit opening) <br>
LAFORGE: What is this? <br>
FARALLON: This is an exocomp, the experiment I was telling you about. <br>
(she uses a PADD, the device lights up, materialises a tool at the
front and flies off down the conduit) <br>
FARALLON: If it doesn't work, we'll still have time to shut down the
fountain. <br>
DATA [OC]: Enterprise to La Forge. What is your situation? <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: Unchanged for the moment, but we're working on it.
Listen, if this doesn't work soon, we're going to have to shut this

KELSO: Aye, sir. <br>
(La Forge, Farallon and an exocomp are beamed aboard) <br>
DATA: Welcome to the Enterprise, Doctor. I am Lieutenant Commander
Data. <br>
FARALLON: Mister Data, I was hoping I'd have a chance to meet you. I've
done extensive studies of your positronic network. <br>
DATA: And I have studied your design for the particle fountain. I find
the concept to be highly innovative. <br>
FARALLON: Thank you. <br>
DATA: I am curious how you were able to repair the power grid so
quickly. <br>
FARALLON: This should make it clear, Commander. <br>
LAFORGE: Why don't we set up in Engineering. <br>
FARALLON: Is it true that your computational speed is limited only by
the physical separation of your positronic links? <br>
DATA: Actually, that is no longer the case. I have recently converted
my interlink sequencer to asynchronous operation, which removed the
performance constraint. <br>
LAFORGE: Doctor, this way please. <br>
FARALLON: I see. But how did you resolve the signal fragmentation? <br>
(as they head out into the corridor) <br>
DATA: The interlink sequencer is now bi-directional. It compensates for
the asynchronous mode distortion arising from the resonant field. <br>
FARALLON: Yes. That's fascinating. Does the sequencer require any
buffering system to eliminate interference?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FARALLON: We've been using devices like this on
Tyrus Seven for years. The basic unit is a common industrial servo
mechanism. A few years ago I started tinkering with one. This is the
result. <br>
LAFORGE: Boridium power converter. Axionic chip network. It's very
impressive. In terms of sheer computational speed, this little guy
might be able to compete with you, Data. <br>
FARALLON: Oh, the exocomps don't come close to Data's sophistication. <br>
DATA: Exocomps? <br>
FARALLON: That's what I call them. Let's say you had an anti-matter
flow converter that was fluctuating. How would you repair it? <br>
DATA: The correct procedure would be to adjust the converter. <br>
FARALLON: With what? <br>
DATA: A mode stabiliser. <br>
FARALLON: Okay. Let me input the problem into the exocomp. A
fluctuating anti-matter flow converter. Now, let's see what happens. <br>
(the little machine materialises a tool to use) <br>
LAFORGE: A mode stabilizer. Very nice. <br>
DATA: You have incorporated a micro-replication system into the device
in order to fashion tools. <br>
FARALLON: It's more than that. I designed the exocomps to be problem
solvers. Whenever they perform a task they've never done before, the
micro-replicator creates new circuit pathways within the unit's memory.
<br>
DATA: So in a sense, they are learning. <br>
FARALLON: Exactly. The more situations they encounter, the more circuit
pathways they build. They become better tools as they work. <br>
LAFORGE: It's impressive technology, that's for sure. Once it's out of
the experimental stage, there'll be plenty of applications. <br>
FARALLON: Commander, I'm hoping the experimental stage is over. When
are we supposed to brief Captain Picard on the status of the particle
fountain? <br>
LAFORGE: At sixteen hundred hours. <br>
FARALLON: Good. I'll have a proposal to make.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FARALLON: Captain, I know you're supposed to give
your evaluation to Starfleet today. I'd like you to postpone that
report another forty eight hours. <br>
PICARD: The Enterprise is scheduled to leave the Tyran system tomorrow.
If I'm to change that plan, I'll need a very good reason. <br>
FARALLON: I realise that, sir. If you're going to make a recommendation
to Starfleet about using the particle fountain on Carema, it seems only
fair that you should see it operating at full strength. <br>
PICARD: Agreed. <br>
FARALLON: I think I can complete the project and boost the efficiency
of the particle stream if I use exocomps, the new devices I've
constructed. <br>
PICARD: I understand one of these devices successfully repaired a
faulty power grid. <br>
FARALLON: Yes, sir. I've been testing them on a limited basis, but I
think they're ready to be used on a larger scale. <br>
PICARD: Mister La Forge, what are your thoughts? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, I guess the only risk is in falling even further behind.
<br>
FARALLON: I'm willing to take that risk. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data? <br>
DATA: Exocomps are highly sophisticated devices, sir. If they perform
up to expectation, their potential to advance this project is
considerable. <br>
PICARD: I'm inclined to agree. I don't think that forty eight hours is
too much time to risk particularly when the gains areso substantial.
You may proceed, Doctor. <br>

with me. <br>

FARALLON: Well, Mister Data, what is your analysis so far? <br>
DATA: I have successfully completed fourteen separate tasks with this
exocomp in the past hour. I estimate it would take two people nine
hours to complete the same tasks. I would characterise the unit's
performance as excellent. <br>

been completely unresponsive ever since. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, let's see what our computer has to say. <br>
DATA: Geordi, the interface circuitry which links the exocomp to the

LAFORGE: That's strange. is there any evidence of secondary power
surges? <br>
DATA: No. <br>
LAFORGE: But what's going on there? Data, increase the magnification of
section gamma four. <br>
DATA: Interesting. The number of new circuit pathways has increased by
six hundred thirty two percent. <br>
FARALLON: Oh, no. <br>
LAFORGE: What is it? <br>
FARALLON: Sometimes an exocomp starts forming large numbers of new
pathways totally at random. Eventually, it reaches a point where it
shuts down. Just like this one. <br>
DATA: Doctor, the new pathways do not appear to be interfering with the
original circuitry. <br>
FARALLON: Once the exocomp is this badly corrupted, it's useless. You
have to erase the unit and start all over again, and there's no time
for that now. <br>
LAFORGE: That leaves you with only two. It's going to slow you down. <br>

problems. Why did that plasma conduit explode? <br>

explosion, it may have been attempting to save itself from destruction.
<br>
FARALLON: Do you have any basis for that conclusion? <br>
DATA: Yes. When you attempted to override the exocomp and send it back
into the tunnel, it responded by deliberately burning out its control
interface. <br>
CRUSHER: Deliberately? <br>
DATA: The computer diagnostic showed that the exocomp disabled its own
interface. <br>
FARALLON: That could have been nothing more than a malfunction. <br>
DATA: However, two hours later, when it was aboard the Enterprise and
no longer in danger, it repaired itself. I believe the exocomp was
protecting itself. And if that is true, it has demonstrated an
awareness of its environment, and an ability to adapt to that
environment. <br>
FARALLON: You're anthropomorphising these units. Like any mechanical
devices, they occasionally malfunction. One time, I saw an exocomp
enter a reaction chamber for no apparent reason and vaporise itself. Is
that supposed to make me think it was depressed and suicidal? <br>
TROI: Doctor, why is it so difficult for you to accept the fact that
the exocomp could be alive? After all, you're talking to a living
machine right now. <br>
FARALLON: And I have nothing but the utmost respect and admiration for
Doctor Soong's accomplishment. But his intention was to create an
artificial life form. I created the exocomps to be tools. And there is
a big difference between Data and a tool. <br>
DATA: Doctor, there is a big difference between you and a virus, but
both are alive. <br>
PICARD: If the possibility exists, no matter how slight, that these
exocomps are lifeforms, then we must examine that possibility. <br>
DATA: Thank you, sir. And until we have a definitive answer, I believe
it would be inappropriate to exploit the exocomps as labourers. <br>
FARALLON: Captain, that's absurd. <br>
CRUSHER: If they are intelligent life forms, we have no right to force
them to work for us. <br>
FARALLON: That's like me telling you not to use your tricorder. <br>
CRUSHER: Tricorders aren't alive. <br>
FARALLON: Neither are exocomps. <br>
PICARD: Clearly these are difficult issues to resolve. We have to
proceed very carefully. So the first task is to test Mister Data's
hypothesis. <br>
LAFORGE: Data, you're claiming that this exocomp may be alive because
it demonstrated survival instincts, right? <br>
DATA: Yes. <br>
LAFORGE: Then why don't we just threaten its survival again and see
what happens? <br>
PICARD: Make it so. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(the exocomp is sitting just inside a Jefferies
tube) <br>
LAFORGE: Doctor, we're pretty much ready here. You can begin
programming it. What we've done, Captain, is to recreate a situation
similar to the one the exocomp encountered in the plasma conduit. <br>
DATA: We have created a small conduit breach in this tube. The exocomp
would normally require several minutes to complete a repair of this
type. Once it enters the tube, it will find that a plasma cascade
failure is in progress. <br>
PICARD: I assume this is a simulation. <br>
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. We're running a transient overload signal that will
simulate a failure in exactly one minute. <br>
FARALLON: If it does possess a survival instinct, as Mister Data
claims, it will exit the tube before the minute is up in order to save
itself. <br>
PICARD: Very well. Proceed. <br>
LAFORGE: Okay. Beginning test programme now. One minute. <br>
(the exocomp heads off) <br>
LAFORGE: Fifty seconds. (it gets to work) Thirty seconds. (it stops and
hesitates, then continues) Ten seconds. Five, four, three, two, one.
That's it. If this had been for real, that conduit would've exploded
with the exocomp inside. Go ahead, Doctor, bring it back in. <br>
FARALLON: Well, Captain, I think we've spent more than enough time
answering this question. I hope the outcome wasn't too much of a
disappointment for you, Mister Data. It certainly came as no surprise
to me. <br>
DATA: Thank you for your help, Doctor. <br>
FARALLON: You're welcome. <br>
PICARD: Well, I consider this time well spent. <br>
DATA: As do I, sir. Thank you. <br>
(later, Data is repeating the experiment) <br>
COMPUTER: Thirty seconds. Twenty seconds. <br>
CRUSHER: Commander Riker said you'd still be down here. He also said
the exocomp failed the test. <br>
DATA: That is true. <br>
COMPUTER: Time expired. Test complete. <br>
DATA: I have completed thirty four additional tests and the results
have been the same in each of them. Perhaps I was wrong in suspecting
the exocomp was alive. <br>
CRUSHER: This was really important to you, wasn't it? <br>
DATA: You said earlier that I am unique. If so, then I am alone in the
universe. When I began investigating the exocomps, I realised I might
be encountering a progenitor of myself. Suddenly the possibility exists
that I was no longer alone. For that reason, I. The exocomp has
returned. <br>
CRUSHER: Wasn't it's supposed to do that? <br>
DATA: In the previous thirty four trials, I brought it back once the
simulated failure occurred. This time we were talking, and I neglected
to do that. <br>
CRUSHER: I distracted you. I'm sorry. <br>
DATA: Do not apologise, Doctor. I believe we have discovered something
significant. <br>
CRUSHER: What? <br>
DATA: The exocomp has replicated a different tool. That is not the
molecular fuser it had when it entered the Jefferies tube. Doctor, the
exocomp not only completed the repairs, it also deactivated the
overload signal. <br>
CRUSHER: I thought this was just a simulation. <br>
DATA: It was, and the exocomp must have realised that. It saw that
there was no real danger and completed the repairs. <br>
CRUSHER: And then replicated the correct tool to eliminate the false
overload signal. <br>
DATA: I see no other possible explanation. <br>
CRUSHER: The exocomp didn't fail the test, it saw right through it.

of minutes. <br>

can't risk the Captain and Geordi on the basis of your belief. Prepare

themselves to be destroyed. They have a sense of survival, and they
will shut down before they will comply with the order. <br>
