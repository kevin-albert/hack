Captain's log, Stardate 41209.2. We are running at warp seven to
rendezvous with the science vessel SS Tsiolkovsky, which has been
routinely monitoring the collapse of a red super giant star into a
white dwarf. What has brought us here is a series of strange messages
indicating something has gone wrong aboard the research vessel.

we have says he's not. <br>

chance that whatever did it is loose on my ship? <br>
CRUSHER: If you mean a disease, sir, I'd say there's no chance of it.
We used full decontamination, we examined every team member very
carefully, <br>
PICARD: The entire crew somehow managed to kill themselves, Doctor. If
it's not a disease, what else could have made them do that? <br>
CRUSHER: The obvious alternatives would be in areas of insanity and
severe emotional upset. Troi, do you feel anything unusual in the
lieutenant? <br>
PICARD: Security just told me that he was longing for normal eyesight.
That's a sudden yearning for that. <br>
TROI: Since his records show no previous mention of that, the fact that
it's happened now could be important. But all I sense from him is
confusion. If I didn't know better, I'd say he was intoxicated. <br>
CRUSHER: Our tests would have shown that. Also any other signs of
drugs, hallucinogens or other contaminants.

RIKER: Captain, the ship's engines are cut off from the bridge. The
Assistant Chief Engineer pulled out the isolinear optical chips from
command. All engines are offline. Wesley has hooked some kind of
tractor beam to ship's power and he has it aimed at the door. We can't
get past to get at the computer. </font></p>

somehow it's different. Maybe it's mutated. But I've got to isolate
it in order to analyse it, <br>

it belongs. At once. <br>
WESLEY [on viewscreen]: I'm sorry, sir. Why don't you just tell me what
you want done and I'll do it. <br>
PICARD: Because ship captains control their own vessels, young man! <br>
WESLEY [on viewscreen]: But, sir, you don't do it yourself. You give
the orders, but someone else does it. What's wrong with giving me the
orders to do it? <br>
WORF: Captain, getting unusual readings now from the dwarf star. <br>
PICARD: Stand by a moment on that. Wesley. Wes. Are you aware that
you're acting strangely, that a kind of infection was brought over from
the Tsiolkovsky which acts like intoxication? <br>
WESLEY [on viewscreen]: Are you saying that's why I feel so so hot? So
strange? <br>
PICARD: That's a very adult bit of reasoning, Wes, <br>
WESLEY [on viewscreen]: So you mean I'm drunk! I feel strange, but also
good. <br>
PICARD: Because, because you've lost the capacity for self-judgment.
Now, alcohol does this, Wesley. But this contaminant we've brought back
from the Tsiolkovsky does it even more so. <br>
WESLEY [on viewscreen]: What would you do if you got your ship back? <br>
PICARD: Oh, it's very important I do, Wesley, because I must
immediately lock a tractor beam onto the Tsiolkovsky, then tow it out
of, <br>
WESLEY [on viewscreen]: Tractor beams are my specialty, Skipper! I'll
contact you when that's done. Wesley out! <br>
