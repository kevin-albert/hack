trust and friendship of other worlds.<br>
KIM: Friendship One. I had to memorise that recording in third grade. <br>
PARIS: Me, too. I even built a model of the probe. <br>
JANEWAY: Then this should look familiar. It was launched in 2067. <br>
PARIS: Just four years after Zefram Cochrane tested his first warp
engine. <br>
NEELIX: What was it designed to do? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Reach out to other species. Pave the way for all the manned
missions that would follow. <br>
KIM: They packed it with information, translation matrices, scientific
and cultural databases <br>
TORRES: Computer chip designs, instructions for building transceivers.
It's practically a how-to manual. <br>
SEVEN: If the Borg had intercepted this probe, humanity would have been
assimilated centuries ago.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Our ancestors had no idea what was out here. <br>
NEELIX: This must have been before your Prime Directive?<br>
TUVOK: It was before Starfleet existed. <br>
JANEWAY: In any case, we lost contact with the probe one hundred and
thirty years ago but, its last known coordinates <br>
TORRES: Let me guess. Were in the neighbourhood. <br>
JANEWAY: Starfleet's mapped out a search grid. It'll take us a little
off course, but if the probe is still intact and we're lucky enough to
find it, we'll be retrieving a little piece of history. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 54775.4. We've been searching for five days without any
sign of the probe, but we're not about to disappoint Starfleet on our

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM:
Nothing in grid two nine five. <br>
TUVOK: Mister Paris? <br>
PARIS: Moving on. <br>
KIM: We should try skipping ahead a little to grid three one zero. I
stayed up all night re-extrapolating the probe's trajectory. I've
compensated for solar winds, ionic interference and a few local
anomalies Starfleet wouldn't know about. <br>
TUVOK: Alter course to grid three one zero. <br>
PARIS: Trying to impress the Starfleet brass? <br>
KIM: Just doing my job. <br>(Later -)<br>KIM: I'm
detecting a titanium signature that matches the probe's parameters. <br>

KIM: A planet two light years away. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
The readings are coming from the northern subcontinent. <br>
JANEWAY: Can you localise them? <br>
SEVEN: There are high levels of antimatter radiation in the atmosphere,
scattering the probe's signature. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Any lifesigns? <br>
SEVEN: None. <br>
JANEWAY: Assemble an away team and take the Flyer down for a closer
look. </font></p>

You seem to be in a good mood, Doctor. <br>
EMH: Just excited to be doing my part for our first official mission,
Mister Carey. <br>(Neelix and Chakotay are also there.)<br>
PARIS: An inoculation a day keeps the radiation away. I took a look at
those atmospheric readings. Thermal eddies, gravimetric sheer. You're
going to need your best pilot. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Are you volunteering? <br>
PARIS: If the Doc can spare me. <br>
EMH: I'll muddle through. (Torres enters.)<br>EMH: If you're here for your foetal resonance scan,
you're a day early. <br>
TORRES: I'm here for my inoculation. <br>
PARIS: You are not going on this mission. <br>
TORRES: Chakotay said he needed an engineer. <br>
PARIS: He's already got one. <br>
TORRES: Now he's got two. <br>
PARIS: Will you excuse us?<br>
NEELIX: Any bets on this one? <br>
CHAKOTAY: My money's on B'Elanna. <br>
TORRES: It's been months since I've been on an away mission. <br>
PARIS: Then try the holodeck. The Flyer is full. <br>
TORRES: You can make room. Neelix doesn't have to go. <br>
PARIS: He's not six months pregnant. <br>
TORRES: Being pregnant doesn't make me an invalid. <br>
PARIS: No, it doesn't.&nbsp;But there's a toxic atmosphere down there and you're
breathing for two. <br>
TORRES: All right, you win. But if we have another baby, you carry it,
and I'll go on the away missions. <br>
PARIS: It's a deal. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
Sorry for the bumpy ride. We'll be clearing the stratosphere in about a
minute. <br>
NEELIX: I had a cousin who used to transport disulfides from a gas
giant. He claimed to love the turbulence. Of course, disulfides are
known to cause delusions. <br>
PARIS: Hang on. <br>(Below the clouds, buildings and roads are visible.)<br>
CAREY: I thought it was uninhabited. <br>
KIM: There's nothing alive down there now. Radiation levels are at six
thousand isorems.<br>
CAREY: I've localised the signature to a three kilometre radius. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Transfer the coordinates to the helm. When we find the
probe, we'll beam it to the cargo hold. <br>
KIM: That may not be easy with all this radiation. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We'd better bring transport enhancers. Set us down, Tom. <br>
PARIS: Yes, sir. <br>
NEELIX: Gently, please.<br>(Someone in a haz-mat suit watches them land.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Everyone is
wearing environment suits as they walk through the driving snow and
crunch through surface ice. They have split up into two groups.) <br>
PARIS: I should have brought a holo-camera so I could show B'Elanna
she's not missing anything. Can you believe she actually wanted to come
with us? <br>
CAREY: When my wife was pregnant, she didn't want to be coddled, either.
<br>
PARIS: And she's not half Klingon. Maybe it's us. Something about
fatherhood seems to regress the male psyche a few thousand years.
<br>(His tricorder beeps. He turns and picks up small round object.) <br>
NEELIX: Tom, be careful. <br>(Paris presses a button, and Four Seasons plays.)<br>
PARIS: It's a toy, like a music box. <br>
CAREY: Vivaldi. I'm getting something. Ninety metres this way. <br>
PARIS: Souvenir. <br>(Paris turns off the music and gives it to Neelix, who puts it in his satchel. They walk on.)<br>KIM:
Commander, I'm detecting an antimatter signature ahead. <br>(They look down on large round structures set into the ground. Each has a hatch which slides open.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Looks like missile silos. <br>
PARIS: Paris to Chakotay. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Go ahead.<br>PARIS:
We've got a reading that could be the probe. It's inside a cave. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Keep us posted. <br>(Chakotay and Kim step onto a silo hatch. Through the slit they can see the big missile sitting underneath them.)<br>CHAKOTAY:
The warhead is still active. <br>
KIM: It wouldn't have taken many of these to trigger a nuclear winter.<br>(And there are silos as far as the eye can see.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Cave]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">NEELIX:
People must have taken shelter here. <br>
CAREY: That makes sense. The magnesite in these caves would have
provided partial shielding from the radiation. <br>
PARIS: Over here. <br>
CAREY: What'd you find? <br>
PARIS: Some kind of control room, or laboratory. <br>
CAREY: Laboratory? <br>
PARIS: Lots of diagnostic equipment. Looks like it was salvaged from a
junk heap. <br>
NEELIX: Or scavenged from the ruins. <br>
CAREY: Particle scanners, circuit analysers. Most of it's still
functional. They were working on something. (He pushes a box aside to brush the dust of a piece of painted metal. Friendship.)<br>
PARIS: This is what we came for. <br>
CAREY: Whoever lived here must have been studying it. <br>
NEELIX: The data core's still intact. <br>

I've analysed his garment. It's lined with magnesite. <br>
JANEWAY: A makeshift environmental suit. <br>
EMH: Unfortunately, the protection it offers is limited. His tissues
are saturated with antimatter radiation. It explains why we couldn't
detect his lifesigns. They're virtually indistinguishable from the
environment. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Now that we know that, maybe we can adjust our sensors to
detect them. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's wake him. <br>(The EMH complies.)<br>JANEWAY: What were you doing aboard our shuttle? <br>
OTRIN: Trying to undo the damage you caused. <br>
JANEWAY: If you're referring to what's happened on your planet, we had
nothing to do with it. <br>
OTRIN: Your people sent the probe, didn't they? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Our ancestors sent it three hundred years ago to make contact
with other species. <br>
OTRIN: They did a little more than that. Am I your prisoner? <br>
EMH: No. You're suffering from prolonged radiation exposure. I can
treat you. <br>
OTRIN: You can? <br>
EMH: I believe I can. <br>
OTRIN: In exchange for what? <br>
EMH: Nothing. <br>
OTRIN: I have a wife, friends. <br>
JANEWAY: We might be able to help them, too. But not while our crewmen
are being held hostage. You said you were trying to undo the damage we
caused. What did you mean by that? <br>
OTRIN: I was aboard your shuttle looking for technology that might help
us neutralise the radiation. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We saw missiles on the surface. Was the destruction caused by
war? <br>
OTRIN: Those missiles were built for defence. They were never launched.
<br>
JANEWAY: Then what accounts for the devastation? <br>
OTRIN: A containment failure in our power grid. Once the antimatter was
released, it destroyed everything. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry, but I still don't see how we're responsible. <br>
OTRIN: Before the probe, my people never conceived of anything like
antimatter. We offer this information freely with the hope that one day
we will stand on your soil and extend our hands in friendship. I'm sure
you recognise those words. <br>
JANEWAY: The recording from the probe. <br>
OTRIN: Your people sent us technology that they knew would destroy us. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't understand. <br>
OTRIN: We didn't either at first. But we had decades to think about it,
and now it seems so obvious. You send us new technology, encourage us
to use it, and then you wait for us to obliterate ourselves. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Why would we do that? <br>
OTRIN: Because it's easier than invading us. <br>
JANEWAY: Do you really believe we'd contaminate a world we intended to
conquer? <br>
OTRIN: I'm a scientist. I believe what I see. And today I saw your
people standing on our soil just as you promised, and they were wearing
equipment that protected them from the radiation because they knew
exactly what to expect. If you were in my position, what would you
believe? </font></p>

weapon called a Metreon Cascade. Hundreds of thousands of people were
killed, including my family. <br>
VERIN: How did you survive? <br>
NEELIX: I was on a neighbouring planet when the weapon was detonated. I
went back with a rescue team, but there was no one left. <br>
VERIN: I'm sorry about what happened to your family, but don't compare
your life to mine.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
The nearest suitable planet is simply too far away so, I'd like to
propose </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Cave]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY
[OC]: An alternative. <br>
VERIN: There is no alternative. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Please, hear me out. We have one of your people aboard, a
Mister Otrin. He has some interesting ideas about counteracting the
radiation. <br>
VERIN: Otrin has too many ideas. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
I think his theories have merit. What he's lacked until now is the
means to carry them out. If you release the hostages, we can work
together. There's a good chance we could undo some of the damage to
your environment. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Cave]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">VERIN:
This isn't a negotiation. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: You don't seem to understand. It would take years to
evacuate the entire planet. <br>
VERIN: So instead you once again offer us the benefits of your
technology. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>

What I'm offering you is a realistic alternative. </font></p>

If I release the hostages, what's to prevent you from leaving </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">VERIN
[OC]: Or attacking us? <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">VERIN:
You haven't given me any reason to. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Then why don't we start with a small step. You return one of the
hostages and I'll send you a supply of food and medicine. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">VERIN:
You. What's your name? <br>
CAREY: Joe Carey. <br>
VERIN: Set up your transport enhancers. <br>(Carey takes the three rods from Verin and activates them.)<br>VERIN: I'm sorry, Mister Carey. <br>
CAREY: Sorry? <br>
VERIN: Your crewman's ready, Captain. </font></p>
