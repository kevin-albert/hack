<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> ICHEB:
Though it was a blatant violation of the Prime Directive, Kirk saved
the Pelosians from extinction, just as he had the Baezians and the
Chenari many years earlier. Finally, in the year 2270, Kirk completed
his historic five year mission and one of the greatest chapters in
Starfleet history came to a close. A new chapter began when Kirk
regained command of the Enterprise. <br>
JANEWAY: How many more chapters are there? <br>
ICHEB: Thirty four. <br>
JANEWAY: This was supposed to be a twenty minute presentation. <br>
ICHEB: I was trying to be thorough. I could shorten the report. <br>
JANEWAY: That won't be necessary. You obviously know the subject
matter. Congratulations, Cadet. You have just passed Early Starfleet
History. <br>
ICHEB: Thank you, Captain. <br>(Icheb leaves. A young man in Starfleet command uniform is behind Janeway, played by John de Lancie's real son, Keegan.) <br>
&nbsp;I would have failed him. Kirk may have been a lowly human, but at
least he had pizzazz. That report made him sound about as exciting as a
Vulcan funeral dirge. <br>
JANEWAY: Janeway to Security. <br>
&nbsp;Don't bother. I trapped your crew in a temporal loop. They keep
experiencing the last thirty seconds over and over. Almost as
monotonous as drone boy's essay. <br>
JANEWAY: Who are you? <br>(Daddy is sitting behind her desk.)<br>
Q: I know he's grown since you last saw him, Kathy, but don't tell me
you can't see the family resemblance. This is my son, Q. I'm a little
hurt you didn't recognise Junior. You are his godmother, after all. <br>
JANEWAY: The last time I saw him, he was an infant. <br>
JUNIOR: Four years ago, in human time. You called me adorable. <br>
JANEWAY: You remember? <br>
JUNIOR: I may have looked like an infant, but I was still a Q. Maybe you
should have picked a better godparent. <br>
Q: I wonder if it's too late to ask Jean-Luc? <br>
JANEWAY: What do you want, Q? <br>
Q: Well, Junior's taking a little vacation from the Continuum. I
recommended he spent it with you. <br>
JANEWAY: Why? <br>
Q: Oh, he's always been fascinated by the old man's stories about
humanity. I thought it was time he had some first hand experience. <br>
JANEWAY: I am flattered that you would entrust me with your first born,
but I really don't have time. <br>
Q: He's as quiet as a Zizznian church mouse. You'll forget he's even
here. <br>(Q disappears.) <br>
JANEWAY: Well, if you're going to stay, we'll need to lay down a few
ground rules. <br>
JUNIOR: I make my own rules. <br>(Junior disappears.) </font></p>

I'm not detecting either Q.<br>
JANEWAY: I want to be alerted if they resurface. Keep running scans. <br>
JUNIOR: Scan, scan, scan. That's all you people ever do. I've been through
every deck on this ship, and do you know what I've seen? Bipeds pushing
buttons. Bipeds replacing relays. Bipeds running diagnostics. When are
you going to do something interesting? <br>
JANEWAY: Say hello to Q, everyone. <br>
JUNIOR: We could fly into fluidic space and fight species 8472. Or we could
detonate a few Omega molecules. What do you say? <br>
JANEWAY: No. <br>
JUNIOR: Twenty minutes observing humanity, I'm already bored. I guess I'm
just going to have to amuse myself. <br>(Junior disappears.) <br>

to breach. <br>
JUNIOR: Relax. It's a party. <br>
JANEWAY: This party is over. Get your guests off my ship. <br>
JUNIOR: I like you, Aunt Kathy. You've got gumption. But what you don't
have is unlimited control of space, matter and time. Which means I give

I could assemble a security team and attempt to take Engineering by

CHAKOTAY: We all know that wouldn't do any good. <br>
TORRES: Besides, I'll bet that's exactly the kind of reaction he's
hoping for. <br>
JANEWAY: He's doing everything he can to get under our skin. <br>
TUVOK: If we deny him the satisfaction of a response, he may become

personality. <br>
JANEWAY: Charming. <br>(Janeway takes the mug of coffee from Neelix.)<br>
NEELIX: I've been giving some thought to the Q situation. Maybe
ignoring him isn't the best solution. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm open to suggestions. <br>
NEELIX: He may be omnipotent, but he's still a young man in need of
guidance. Perhaps if someone were to approach him as a friend. <br>
JANEWAY: You think he needs a mentor. <br>
NEELIX: Exactly. <br>
JANEWAY: Are you volunteering? <br>

NEELIX: Well, no. <br>

said I should pay attention to how you humans react under pressure. <br>
(There are three attacking Borg Cubes on the viewscreen.) <br>
JUNIOR: Is this enough pressure? <br>
CHAKOTAY: We're venting plasma. <br>
JANEWAY: Reroute power to aft shields and return fire. <br>

when - flash! The Borg are gone and Q is there, looking furious.) <br>
JUNIOR: We were just getting to the good part! <br>
Q: If the Continuum's told you once, they've told you a thousand times.
Don't provoke the Borg! Now, I want you to give Aunt Kathy your word
you won't do it again. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, he won't do it again because he's leaving. Now. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> Q: He
isn't so bad once you get to know him. He's just misunderstood. <br>
JANEWAY: He tried to kill my crew. <br>
Q: No one was hurt, I repaired the damage to your ship. I even gave
your pet Talaxian his vocal cords back. Everything's exactly as it was.
<br>
JANEWAY: And how long do you think it will take your son to come up
with another way to amuse himself? If you knew he was dangerous, why
did you send him here? Ah, is this another lesson for humanity? <br>
Q: It's supposed to be a lesson for him. Think back to my last visit. I
made you the offer of a lifetime. <br>
JANEWAY: Asking me to mate with you was hardly the offer of a lifetime.
<br>
Q: If you hadn't turned me down, I wouldn't have been forced to mate
with that other Q. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, get to the point. <br>
Q: My point is, Junior was suppose to inspire peace and compassion. But
instead of order, he's brought chaos. He's been starting wars among
innocent species, tampering with primordial gene pools, punching holes
in the fabric of space time. <br>
JANEWAY: Where's his mother been during all this? <br>
Q: She's been so humiliated by his antics she's disowned him. She's
blamed me for everything. I've managed to undo most of the damage, but
that wasn't good enough for the Continuum. They're hounding me to
straighten the boy out. That's why I brought him here. In hopes that
your vaunted Starfleet ideals would rub off on him. Obviously, that
hasn't happened. <br>
JANEWAY: You can't just dump your child on someone and hope he learns
something. <br>
Q: I can't? <br>
JANEWAY: He needs to be parented. <br>
Q: And how exactly am I supposed to do that? Q is the first child born
in the Continuum, which makes me the first parent. I don't even know
where to begin. <br>
JANEWAY: You could start by spending time with him. <br>
Q: Urgh. <br>
JANEWAY: Parenthood is more than just cleaning up your child's messes.
You need to set an example. It's the only way he'll learn. <br>
Q: Of course. Once he begins to know me better, he'll idolise me. Then
he'll do anything I say. Kathy <br>(He kisses her.) <br>Q: You're a genius.

take it back. You're not a genius. I should have known better than to
take the advice of a human. <br>
JANEWAY: Q! <br>
Q: Your brilliant plan didn't work. I smothered the boy with attention,
spent every waking moment with him. But things only got worse. <br>
JANEWAY: You've been gone for less than ten minutes. <br>
Q: On your temporal plane, maybe. But in Q time we've spent years
together. Now he's embarrassed to be seen with me, and it's all your
fault. <br>
JANEWAY: My fault? <br>
Q: Tell me how you plan to rectify the situation. <br>
JANEWAY: What happened after you left Voyager? <br>
Q: Q got away from me and rearranged to tectonic plates on Bozel Prime.
<br>
JANEWAY: Did you punish him? <br>
Q: Well, I tried to get him to apologise to all sixteen billion
Bozelians, but he got angry and stopped talking to me. <br>
JANEWAY: So you gave in to him. <br>
Q: I told him he could shift as many continents as he liked as long as
no one got hurt. <br>
JANEWAY: You're not going to do your son any favours by indulging him.
You need to make him understand that there are consequences to his
actions. <br>
Q: Consequences? Hmm. Kathy, I take it back. You are a genius. <br>(He leans
forward for a kiss, and gets offered the sole of her foot. It gets a kiss.) </font></p>

JUNIOR: What was that for! <br>
Q: What's wrong? You didn't enjoy life as an Oprelian amoeba? <br>
JUNIOR: No. I was shapeless and slimy. The only thing to eat was paramecia.
<br>
Q: Sounds unpleasant. I'm sure you'll do whatever you can to avoid
returning to that Petrie dish. <br>
JUNIOR: What are you talking about? <br>
Q: The Continuum and I have come to an agreement about your future.
Either you become an upstanding citizen of the cosmos, or you'll be
sentenced to eternity as a amoeba. How's that for consequences? <br>
JUNIOR: You'd turn your own son into a microscopic lifeform? <br>
Q: You have one week to change your ways. I suggest you make the most
of it. <br>
JUNIOR: Fine, I'll see you in seven days. <br>(Junior snaps his fingers, but nothing happens. He keeps trying.) <br>
Q: We've temporarily relieved you of your powers, to ensure that you're
on your best behaviour with the captain. <br>
JUNIOR: You're leaving me here? <br>
JANEWAY: I though we agreed that you were going to take a more active
role. <br>
Q: I'd like to, Kathy. But we both know that you're a million times the
parent I am. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm not a parent. <br>
Q: Maybe not in the biological sense, but you're certainly a mommy to
this crew. Just look how quickly you house-broke that Borg drone. <br>
JANEWAY: It's taken years for Seven to become an individual. You're
asking me to change your son in one week?<br>
Q: I'm sure you'll think of something. <br>
JUNIOR: What if she doesn't? <br>
Q: Then it's single-cellular city for you, my boy. <br>(Q throws him the dish and disappears.) <br>
JUNIOR: I'm getting off this ship. <br>(Junior throws the dish to the deck and steps on it before leaving.)<br>

to be the saviour of the Q Continuum. Tell me, how do you save a race
that's already omnipotent? <br>

that you make a sincere effort, but you weren't even willing to try. <br>

machinery, but these aren't ordinary circumstances. <br>(Icheb gives up the helm to Junior, and immediately an alarm sounds.)
<br>JUNIOR: Did I do something wrong? <br>
PARIS: Just a little ion imbalance in the impulse drive. Nothing to
worry about. <br>
JUNIOR: Well, it's very distracting. Can't you fix it? <br>
PARIS: I could, but we'd have to go back to Voyager and run
diagnostics. If you two don't mind cutting your lesson a little short? <br>
JUNIOR: That won't be necessary. In fact I barely hear it any more. Do you
hear it? <br>
ICHEB: Hear what? </font></p>

JANEWAY: I'll catch the next one. <br>(Janeway closes the door on him and walks on.) <br>
Q: Oh, you can't get away from me that easily. <br>
JANEWAY: It's only been five days. Why are you back? <br>
Q: Oh, I thought I'd just pop in and check on Junior. I'm not an
entirely uninvolved father, you know. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, he got off to a pretty shaky start, but he's made some
progress since then. <br>
Q: Really? <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Junior is reading his essay.)<br>JUNIOR: The
Continuum has been perceived in a variety of ways. A dreary desert
road, a blood-soaked battle ground. But with the help of Voyager's crew
I've begun to perceive it in another context. A home. I look forward to
the day when I return there and make that perception a reality. <br>
JANEWAY: Well? What did you think? <br>
Q: Oh, it's very nice. <br>
JANEWAY: Nice? <br>
Q: Yes. I especially liked the part about the Continuum. <br>
JANEWAY: The entire essay was about the Continuum. <br>
Q: Yes, and it's very nice. <br>
JUNIOR: I'm late for my temporal mechanics lesson. <br>(Junior slams the PADD down on the desk and leaves.) <br>
JANEWAY: Q. <br>
Q: Well, if there's nothing else, I'll be on my way. <br>
JANEWAY: He worked so hard on that paper, the least you could have done
was tell him you were proud of him. <br>
Q: But I'm not. <br>JANEWAY: Oh. <br>Q: And frankly, it's a little hard to be impressed with any
of the boy's accomplishments. He's been here for five days and what
have you taught him? How to scribble essays and play with holograms?
What's next, basket weaving? <br>
JANEWAY: Whether you're willing to admit it or not, your son has made
progress here. He has the potential to be a better Q than you will ever
be. <br>
Q: Potential isn't going to be enough for the Continuum. <br>
JANEWAY: Then what will be enough? <br>
Q: The boy needs to demonstrate nothing less than exemplary Q-ness. <br>
JANEWAY: And what exactly is Q-ness? <br>
Q: Oh, it's impossible for your miniscule mind to comprehend. But I
know Q-ness when I see it. And this <br>(Q picks up the PADD.) <br>Q: Is not it. </font></p>

JANEWAY: I thought you might be upset by Q's reaction to your essay. <br>
JUNIOR: He's impossible to please. I don't care what he thinks. <br>
JANEWAY: We have two days left. Let's make the most of them. <br>
JUNIOR: Aunt Kathy, do you think the Continuum will be any more impressed
with me than Q was? That's what I thought. <br>
JANEWAY: If the Continuum decides they won't take you back, I'll ask
them to let you stay here. <br>
JUNIOR: I don't think they care where an amoeba spends eternity. <br>
JANEWAY: That's not what I meant. I'll ask them to let you remain
human. <br>

ICHEB: What can I do for you, Q-ball? <br>
JUNIOR: I need your help. Remember that ion imbalance Lieutenant Paris
mentioned during our lesson? We're going to repair it for him. <br>
ICHEB: Did you get permission? <br>
JUNIOR: That would ruin the surprise. <br>
ICHEB: Surprise? <br>
JUNIOR: The captain's been encouraging me to take more initiative. I want
to show her I can do things for others without being asked. <br>
ICHEB: I'll help you, on one condition. <br>
JUNIOR: Name it. <br>
ICHEB: You won't refer to me as Itchy in front of the senior

I've realigned the last pair of power couplings. You can start the

JUNIOR: Understood. <br>
ICHEB: I'm not detecting any ion fluctuations. We did it. You can power
down the engine now. Q, what are you doing? <br>
JUNIOR: You're going to love this. I once learned how to open a spatial
flexure using nothing more than a deflector array. <br>
ICHEB: Flexure? <br>
JUNIOR: It's like a tunnel through space. I'm going to open one to the
Clevari system. Wait till you see the females. They're spectacular, <br>
ICHEB: We need the captain's permission to leave Voyager. <br>
JUNIOR: Do you think she'd give it to us? <br>
ICHEB: No. <br>
JUNIOR: Then there's no point in asking. <br>
ICHEB: You've been doing so well. Why break the rules now? <br>
JUNIOR: I'm bored. <br>
ICHEB: Icheb to Security. <br>
JUNIOR: They can't hear you. I've dampened all outgoing communications.

JUNIOR: I'm getting out of here before my father can put me back in that Petrie dish. <br>
ICHEB: The Q are omnipotent. They'll find you. <br>
JUNIOR: I may not have my powers anymore, but I know plenty of cosmic nooks
and crannies we can hide in. Voyager's locked onto us with a tractor
beam. They're so predictable. </font></p>

Fektar to a grappling contest? <br>
ICHEB: What I want is to return to Voyager. <br>
JUNIOR: Forget that dreary ship, with it's rules and regulations. We can do
anything we want here. <br>
ICHEB: Go back to Voyager, apologise to the captain. She'll help you. <br>
JUNIOR: It's too late. She said one more violation and I'd be thrown off
her ship. I'm pretty sure this qualifies. <br>
ICHEB: What's wrong? <br>
JUNIOR: There's a vessel approaching. <br>
ALIEN [on viewscreen]: You're trespassing in Chokuzan space. <br>
JUNIOR: We were just leaving. <br>
ALIEN [on viewscreen]: Our laws require that you be incarcerated
pending an investigation. <br>
JUNIOR: How long will that take? <br>
ALIEN [on viewscreen]: Disengage your engines and prepare to be
boarded. <br>
ICHEB: We should do as he says. <br>
JUNIOR: Why? Just because he has a bigger ship? <br>
ICHEB: Because Captain Janeway has taught us to respect the laws of
other cultures. <br>
JUNIOR: I should have known better than to bring you along. <br>(Junior shoots at the Chokuzan ship and flies off.)<br>
ICHEB: You're going to get us killed! <br>
JUNIOR: Did you expect me to surrender? He might have locked us up for
years. <br>
ICHEB: You don't know that. <br>(Whumph!)<br>
JUNIOR: There's no time for debate. I need you at tactical. <br>(He lowers the
forcefield.) <br>
ICHEB: Shields are down to thirty percent. Sixteen percent. <br>
JUNIOR: I'm opening another flexure. We'll go to the Zozak system. The
girls there aren't as attractive but we have to make some compromises.

JUNIOR: Icheb stole a shuttle from Voyager. I tried to stop him but he
kidnapped me. And he started a fight with another ship. <br>

don't face the consequences of your actions. If your little playmate
has to die to teach you a lesson, so be it. <br>(Q disappears.) <br>
JUNIOR: I know you can hear me, Q. Come back! Q! <br>
JANEWAY: You're wasting your time. <br>
JUNIOR: He's the only one who can save Icheb. <br>
JANEWAY: No, he isn't. You're going back to that ship you attacked.
You're going to apologise for what you did, and you're going to plead
with him for the information we need to save Icheb. <br>
JUNIOR: Look at what they did to him. If I go back they'll do the same to
me. <br>
EMH: What do you care? By this time tomorrow you'll be an amoeba. <br>
JUNIOR: Well, I'd rather be an amoeba than a corpse. <br>
JANEWAY: That would be easier, wouldn't it. No expectations to live up
to, no one to disappoint. <br>
JUNIOR: I'm a failure as a Q and a human. If I'm a single celled organism,
at least I can't hurt anybody. <br>
JANEWAY: Why did you come back here? <br>
JUNIOR: To escape the Chokuzan. <br>
JANEWAY: You could have used your technology to take you anywhere, but
you came back here, to us. Why? <br>
JUNIOR: I probably hit the wrong control. Icheb is the only friend I've
ever had. I brought him back here because I thought you could save him.
Obviously I was mistaken. <br>
JANEWAY: The only mistake you made was running away. You have a chance
to do the right thing now. Don't waste it. </font></p>

for what happened. I'll do anything you ask. Just help my friend. <br>
JANEWAY: My crew and I will repair any damage he did to your ship. <br>

actions of their children. <br>
JUNIOR: I attacked your ship. I should be punished for it, not her. <br>
ALIEN [on viewscreen]: You don't even know what the punishment is. It
might be torture, or even execution. <br>
JUNIOR: I don't care, if it means saving my friend. <br>
ALIEN [on viewscreen]: Well done, Junior. I'm proud of you. <br>(The alien snaps his fingers and flash! It's Q on the screen) <br>Q [on screen]: Surprise! <br>(Another flash and he's on the Flyer, laughing.)
<br>Q: I wish you could see the look on your faces. Oh, wait. You can. <br>(He gives
them mirrors.) <br>
JUNIOR: We don't have time for your games. We need to find the real people
I attacked. <br>
Q: You just did. I was the Chokuzan you fired on. <br>
JANEWAY: What kind of horrible joke <br>
Q: Not a joke, a test. I knew the pathetic little exercises you had him
performing would not impress the Continuum. So, when he escaped your
clutches I devised a real test. It was touch and go there for a moment,
but you passed with flying colours. <br>
JANEWAY: What about Icheb? <br>
Q: Your Doctor will discover he's made a miraculous recovery. Now then,

We're ready, your Honour.&nbsp;<br>

that Q has not made sufficient progress to warrant the reinstatement of
his powers. <br>
Q: Objection. What about my test? <br>
JUDGE: What about it? <br>
Q: Q was willing to sacrifice himself to save his friend. Surely that
counts for something? <br>

JUNIOR: Do you have a moment? A few days ago you offered to let me remain
on Voyager. I know I've made a few mistakes since then, and you
probably don't want me around. But, if it's all right with you, I'd like
to continue my training. <br>
JANEWAY: But you have nothing left to prove to the Continuum. <br>

JANEWAY: What about your father? <br>
JUNIOR: You don't honestly believe we'll see him again, do you? He
obviously doesn't want me around. Why else would he have left me here? Twice. <br>
Q: The question you should be asking is why I keep coming back. Now,
I'm sorry I left so abruptly, but the Continuum's verdict demanded an
immediate appeal. I told them I refused to belong to any Continuum that
wouldn't accept my son as a member. We're a package deal. <br>
JUNIOR: You left the Continuum for me? <br>
Q: Oh, don't be ridiculous. I'm the only one holding that place
together. And when they realised they might lose me, they crumbled like
a Gelbian sand sculpture. <br>

seen. <br>
JUNIOR: We've tried that already. <br>
Q: Things'll be different this time. I promise. Now run along. I'll
meet you on Golos Prime (wink) after I've had a few moments alone with the captain. <br>
JUNIOR: I'll see you soon, Aunt Kathy. <br>
JANEWAY: I certainly hope so. <br>(Junior disappears.) <br>JANEWAY: So, the Continuum
crumbled like a Gelbian sand sculpture? <br>
Q: Yes. Some of them even got on their knees and begged me to stay. It
was pathetic. If you must know, I had to agree to a few minor
conditions. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh? Such as? <br>
Q: Eternal custody of the boy. Wherever the little brat goes, I go with
him. <br>
JANEWAY: I hope he won't spoil too much of your fun. <br>
Q: Oh, before I leave. <br>(Q gives her a PADD.) <br>Q: I did a little homework for
you. Consider it a thank you for everything you did for Junior. <br>
JANEWAY: Not that I don't appreciate it, but this will only take a few
years off our journey. Why not send us all the way? <br>
Q: What sort of an example would I be setting for my son if I did all
the work for you? </font> </p>
