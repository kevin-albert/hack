(a huge explosion spreading out through space)<br>
<p> Stardate 9521.6, Captain's log, U.S.S. Excelsior. Hikaru Sulu commanding. After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel, cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in the Beta Quadrant. We're heading home under full impulse power. I am pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.<br>
<p>

<p>
SULU: According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.<br>
(the ship begins to shudder and Sulu's teacup rattles off his table and breaks on the floor)<br>
VALTANE: I have an energy wave from two hundred and forty degrees mark six port.<br>
SULU: Visual! My ...God. ...Shields!<br>
(an energy wave hits the ship throwing the crew about)<br>
LOJUR (OC): Captain, she's not answering her helm.<br>
SULU: Starboard thrusters. Turn her into the wave!<br>
LOJUR: Aye.<br>
SULU: Quarter impulse power! ...Damage report.<br>
EXCELSIOR ENGINEER: Checking all systems, Captain.<br>
SULU: Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.<br>
VALTANE: Negative, sir. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three two three, mark seven five. Location. It's Praxis, sir. It's a Klingon moon.<br>
SULU: Praxis is their key energy production facility. ...Send to Klingon High Command. 'This is Excelsior, a Federation starship. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do you require assistance?'<br>
RAND: Aye sir.<br>
SULU: Mister Valtane, any more data?<br>
VALTANE: Yes sir. I have confirmed the location of Praxis, sir, but...<br>
SULU: What is it?<br>
VALTANE: I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.<br>
SULU: On screen! ...Magnify!<br>
COMPUTER VOICE: Computer enhancement.<br>
SULU: Praxis?<br>
VALTANE: What's left of it, sir.<br>
RAND: Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.<br>
SULU: Let's have it.<br>
KERLA (on viewscreen): This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command. There has been an incident on Praxis. However everything is under control. We have no need for assistance. Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone. This transmission ends now.<br>
SULU: An incident?<br>
RAND: Do we report this, sir?<br>
SULU: Are you kidding?<br>

<b>[Starfleet briefing room]</b>
<p>
KIRK: What are we doing here?<br>
McCOY: Maybe they're throwing us a retirement party.<br>
SCOTT: That suits me. I've just bought a boat.<br>
UHURA: This had better be good. I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.<br>
CHEKOV: Isn't this just for top brass?<br>
KIRK: If we're all here, where's Sulu?<br>
McCoy: Captain Sulu. ...On assignment.<br>
KIRK: Where's Spock?<br>
AIDE-DE-CAMP: This briefing is classified. Ladies and Gentlemen, the C-in-C.<br>
C in C: As you were. I'll break this information down succinctly. The Klingon Empire has roughly fifty years of life left. ...For full details, I am turning this briefing over to Federation Special Envoy.<br>
SPOCK: Good morning. Two months ago a Federation starship monitored an explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis. We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions. The moon's decimation means a deadly pollution of their ozone. They will have depleted their supply of oxygen in approximately fifty Earth years. Due to their enormous military budget, the Klingon economy does not have the resources to combat this catastrophe. Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council. He proposes to commence negotiations at once.<br>
CARTWRIGHT: Negotiations for what?<br>
SPOCK: The dismantling of our space stations and starbases along the Neutral Zone, an end to almost seventy years of unremitting hostility with the Klingons, which the Klingons can no longer afford.<br>
MILITARY AIDE: Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?<br>
C in C: I'm sure that our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected, Captain, but...<br>
CARTWRIGHT: I must protest. To offer the Klingons a safe haven within Federation space is suicide. Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy. And if we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species with a foothold on our territory. The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees. Then we'll be in a far better position to dictate terms.<br>
KIRK: Sir!<br>
C in C: Captain Kirk?<br>
KIRK: The Klingons have never been trustworthy. I'm forced to agree with Admiral Cartwright. This is a terrifying idea.<br>
SPOCK: It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his Empire that it is better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.<br>
C in C: You, Captain Kirk, you are to be our first olive branch.<br>
SPOCK: We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon vessel that is bringing Chancellor Gorkon to Earth, and to escort him safely through Federation space.<br>
KIRK: Me?<br>
C in C: Well, there are Klingons who feel the same way about the peace treaty as yourself and Admiral Cartwright. But they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.<br>
SPOCK: I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.<br>
KIRK: You ...have personally ...vouched?<br>
C in C: You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain.<br>
KIRK: But a full Ambassador would be better equipped...<br>
C in C: If there's no further business ...I wish you and your crew Godspeed. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. ...I remind you this meeting is classified.<br>
CARTWRIGHT: I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.<br>
McCOY: I wouldn't!<br>
KIRK: We volunteered?<br>
SPOCK: There's an old Vulcan proverb. 'Only Nixon could go to China.'<br>
KIRK: How could you vouch for me? That's ...arrogant presumption.<br>
SPOCK: My father requested that I open negotia...<br>
KIRK: I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this. They're animals!<br>
SPOCK: Jim, there is an historic opportunity here.<br>
KIRK: Don't believe them! Don't trust them!<br>
SPOCK: They're dying.<br>
KIRK: Let them die! ...Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months? We've done our bit for King and Country. ...You should have trusted me.<br>

SHUTTLECRAFT VOICE: Control, this is SD one zero three approaching Spacedock.<br>
SPACEDOCK VOICE: SD one zero three, you are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to NCC one seven zero one alpha. Over.<br>

VALERIS: Captain on the bridge.<br>
KIRK: As you were. ...Lieutenant?<br>
VALERIS: Valeris, sir. We were told that you needed a helmsman so I volunteered.<br>
SPOCK: Lieutenant, It is agreeable to see you again. The Lieutenant was the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of the class at the Academy.<br>
KIRK: You must be very proud.<br>
VALERIS: I don't believe so, sir.<br>
McCOY: She's a Vulcan all right.<br>
KIRK: Let's get this over with. Departure stations. ...Scotty?<br>
SCOTT (OC): Aye sir?<br>
KIRK: Did you find the engine room?<br>
SCOTT (OC): Right where I left it, sir.<br>
KIRK: Standby. Uhura, get me the dock master.<br>
UHURA: Control tower, reading, sir.<br>
KIRK: Control, this is Enterprise ...requesting permission to depart.<br>
SPACEDOCK VOICE: This is control. Enterprise, Permission to depart granted. ...Thirty seconds for port gates.<br>
VALERIS: Clear all moorings.<br>
KIRK: Awaiting port gates from this mark.<br>
SPACEDOCK VOICE: All lines cleared.<br>
VALERIS: Aft thrusters.<br>
KIRK: Thank you. Lieutenant, one-quarter impulse power.<br>
VALERIS: Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in Spacedock?<br>
SPOCK: Hm. Hm.<br>
McCOY (OC): Jim?<br>
KIRK: You heard the order, Lieutenant.<br>
VALERIS: Aye sir.<br>
<p>
Captain's log, stardate 9522.6. I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.<br>
<p>
<p>
<b>[Kirk's quarters]</b>
<p>
Captain's log. (continued) I can never forgive them for the death of my boy. To me our mission to escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit ...is problematic, at best. Spock says this could be an historic occasion, and I'd like to believe him. But how on earth can history get past people like me?<br>
VALERIS: Hm! ...Sir.<br>
KIRK: You could have knocked.<br>
VALERIS: We are almost at the rendezvous, sir. I thought that you would like to know.<br>
KIRK: Right.<br>
VALERIS: Permission to speak freely, sir? ...It is an honour to serve with you.<br>
KIRK: You piloted well out of Spacedock, Lieutenant.<br>
VALERIS: I always wanted to try that.<br>
<p>
<b>[Spock's quarters]</b>
<p>
SPOCK: You've done well, Valeris. As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction. And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.<br>
VALERIS: I do not understand this representation.<br>
(referring to a painting on the wall)<br>
SPOCK: It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology. 'The Expulsion from Paradise.'<br>
VALERIS: Why keep it in your quarters?<br>
SPOCK: To be a reminder to me that all things end.<br>
VALERIS: It is of endings that I wish to speak. Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognise ...that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?<br>
SPOCK: History is replete with turning points, Lieutenant. You must have faith.<br>
VALERIS: Faith?<br>
SPOCK: That the universe will unfold as it should.<br>
VALERIS: But is this logical? Surely we must...<br>
SPOCK: Logic? ...Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Valeris, not the end. ...This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew. Nature abhors a vacuum. I intend you to replace me.<br>
VALERIS: I could only succeed you, sir.<br>
UHURA (on intercom): Now hear this. All officers to the bridge. Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow. All officers to the bridge.<br>

GORKON (on viewscreen): This is Kronos One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.<br>
KIRK: Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting on Earth.<br>
GORKON (on viewscreen): Thank you, Captain.<br>
KIRK: Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?<br>
GORKON (on viewscreen): We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.<br>
KIRK: We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at nineteen thirty hours.<br>
GORKON (on viewscreen): I shall look forward to that.<br>
KIRK: I hope you're happy.<br>
VALERIS: Captain, there is a supply of Romulan ale aboard. It might make the evening pass more ...smoothly?<br>
KIRK: Officer thinking, Lieutenant.<br>
CHEKOV: Guess who is coming to dinner?<br>

GORKON: Captain Kirk.<br>
KIRK: May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.<br>
GORKON: Captain, face to face at last. ...You have my thanks.<br>
SPOCK: Chancellor.<br>
GORKON: Gentlemen, this is my daughter Azetbur, ...my military advisor Brigadier Kerla, ...and this is General Chang my chief of staff.<br>
CHANG: I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.<br>
KIRK: I'm not sure how to take that.<br>
KERLA: Sincere admiration, Kirk,...<br>
CHANG: ...from one warrior to another.<br>
KIRK: Right. ...This way. I think you might enjoy a brief tour.<br>

GORKON: I offer a toast. ...The undiscovered country, ...the future.<br>
ALL: The undiscovered country.<br>
SPOCK: Hamlet, act three, scene one.<br>
GORKON: You have not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon.<br>
CHANG: (in Klingonese) 'To be or not to be.'<br>
KERLA: Captain Kirk, I thought Romulan ale was illegal.<br>
KIRK: One of the advantages of being a thousand light years from Federation headquarters.<br>
McCOY: To you, Chancellor Gorkon, one of the architects of our future.<br>
ALL: Chancellor!<br>
SCOTT: Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.<br>
CHANG: Tell me, Captain Kirk, would you be willing to give up Starfleet?<br>
SPOCK: I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.<br>
CHANG: Ah.<br>
KIRK: Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always been...<br>
CHANG: Come now, Captain, there's no need to mince words. In space, all warriors are cold warriors.<br>
UHURA: Er. General, are you fond of ...Shakes ....peare?<br>
CHEKOV: We do believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.<br>
AZETBUR: Inalien... If only you could hear yourselves? 'Human rights.' Why the very name is racist. The Federation is no more than a 'homo sapiens' only club.<br>
CHANG: Present company excepted, of course.<br>
KERLA: In any case, we know where this is leading. The annihilation of our culture.<br>
McCOY: That's not true!<br>
KERLA: No!<br>
McCOY: No!<br>
CHANG: 'To be, or not to be!', that is the question which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. ...We need breathing room.<br>
KIRK: Earth, Hitler, nineteen thirty-eight.<br>
CHANG: I beg your pardon?<br>
GORKON: Well, ...I see we have a long way to go.<br>

Hm, Captain. 'Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?'<br>

SCOTT: Thank God.<br>
UHURA: Did you see the way they ate?<br>
CHEKOV: Terrible table manners.<br>
SPOCK: I doubt that our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.<br>
KIRK: I'm going to sleep it off. Please let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.<br>
McCOY: I'm going to find a pot of black coffee.<br>

Captain's log. The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon and company to dinner last night. Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post. Note to the galley. Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.<br>

<b>[Enterprise-A bridge]</b>

SPOCK: Ah, Captain.<br>
KIRK: What is it?<br>
SPOCK: I find this curious.<br>
KIRK: Spock, I'm really tired.<br>

CHEKOV: Only the size of my head!<br>

McCOY (on viewscreen): For twenty-seven years I have been ship's Surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise. In three months I stand down.<br>

COLONEL WORF: Objection! My client's political views are not on trial.<br>
CHANG: On the contrary, Captain Kirk's views and motives are, indeed, at the very heart of the matter. This officer's record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled, career-minded opportunist with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him.<br>
KLINGON JUDGE: Continue.<br>
CHANG: Indeed the record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral and that Admiral Kirk was broken for taking matters into his own hands in defiance of regulations and the law. Do you deny you were demoted for these charges, Captain? Don't wait for the translation. Answer me now!<br>
KIRK: I cannot deny it.<br>

MARTIA: Must have been your lifelong ambition.<br>
KIRK: Isn't it about time you became something else?<br>
MARTIA: I like it here.<br>
KLINGON COMMANDANT (OC): Well, well, well...<br>

MARTIA: Kill him! He's the one!<br>
KIRK: Not me, you idiot. Him!<br>
(the Klingon Commandant vaporises the Martia Kirk with his disruptor)<br>
KLINGON COMMANDANT: No witnesses!<br>
KIRK: Killed while trying to escape.<br>
McCOY: Damned clever if you ask me.<br>
KIRK: It's a classic.<br>
KLINGON COMMANDANT: That's what he wanted.<br>
KIRK: Who? Who wants us killed?<br>
KLINGON COMMANDANT: Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you? His name is...<br>

KLINGON COMMANDANT (on viewscreen): (in Klingonese) They were beamed aboard a Federation starship! I could trace...<br>
CHANG: (in Klingonese) Escaped. ...Escaped.<br>
KLINGON GENERAL #2: (in Klingonese) Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.<br>
CHANG: (in Klingonese) Are you sure? Will you take that chance?<br>
KLINGON GENERAL #2: (in Klingonese) Helmsman, make a course to intercept Enterprise!<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise-A corridor]</b>
<p>
SPOCK: The Klingons have a new weapon. A Bird-of-Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.<br>
KIRK: So, that's it.<br>
SPOCK: Not entirely. I have reason to believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this vessel.<br>
KIRK: I have a problem about that. Has the peace conference begun?<br>
CHEKOV: Who knows? The location is a secret.<br>
KIRK: There's always something.<br>
SCOTT: Captain! Mister Spock, I've found the missing uniforms with the Klingon blood on them!<br>
(as they round a corner they find two crewmen lying dead)<br>
SCOTT: But the uniforms belong to these two men! Burke ...and Samno!<br>
McCOY: Not any more. Phaser on stun at close range.<br>
KIRK: First rule of assassination. Kill the assassins.<br>
SCOTT: Now we're back to square one.<br>
KIRK: Can I talk to you?<br>
McCOY: I wonder why they weren't vaporised?<br>
SCOTT: It would set off the alarm.<br>

SPOCK: It's possible.<br>

KIRK: I'd just as soon you didn't.<br>
McCOY: The operation is over.<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise-A bridge]</b>
<p>
VALERIS: I did not fire. You cannot prove anything.<br>
KIRK: Yes I can. At my trial my personal log was used against me. ...How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?<br>
VALERIS: You knew? ...I tried to tell you but you would not listen.<br>
SPOCK: Neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you, about having faith.<br>
VALERIS: You have betrayed the Federation. ...All of you.<br>
McCOY: And what do you think you've been doing?<br>
VALERIS: Saving Starfleet. Klingons cannot be trusted. Sir, ...you said so yourself. They killed your son. Did you not wish Gorkon dead? 'Let them die.' you said. Did I misinterpret you? ...And you were right. They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor. How trustworthy can they be?<br>
McCOY: Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.<br>
KIRK: Who is 'us?'<br>
VALERIS: Everyone who stands to lose from peace.<br>
KIRK: Names, Lieutenant.<br>
VALERIS: My comrades will make sure all your ship-to-ship transmissions are Jammed.<br>
KIRK: Names, Lieutenant.<br>
VALERIS: I do not remember.<br>

KIRK (OC): Where is the peace conference? ...Where is the peace conference?<br>
VALERIS: Ah! ...Ah! ...Ah! ...Aarrgh!<br>
SPOCK: She does not know.<br>
SCOTT: Then we're dead.<br>
SPOCK: I've been dead before. Contact Excelsior. ...She'll have the co-ordinates.<br>
UHURA (OC): I've already got it, sir.<br>
SULU (on viewscreen): Standing by, Captain Kirk.<br>
KIRK: Sulu! You realise that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.<br>
SULU (on viewscreen): I'm sorry, Captain, your message is breaking up.<br>
KIRK: Bless you, Sulu. Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.<br>
SULU (on viewscreen): The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending exact coordinates on a coded frequency.<br>
KIRK: I'm afraid we gonna more than that. There's a Bird-of-Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while cloaked.<br>
SULU (on viewscreen): Surely not.<br>
KIRK: Hold on. ...How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant!<br>
VALERIS: Just the prototype.<br>
KIRK: Do you hear that?<br>
SULU (on viewscreen): I'm getting underway now. We're now in Alpha Quadrant. The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.<br>
KIRK: When does this conference start?<br>
SULU (on viewscreen): According to my information, today.<br>
KIRK: Thank you, Captain Sulu.<br>
SULU (on viewscreen): Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.<br>
<p>
<b>[Spock's quarters]</b>
<p>
KIRK: Spock?<br>
SPOCK: I prefer it dark.<br>
KIRK: Dining on ashes?<br>
SPOCK: You were right. It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation. You and the Doctor might have been killed.<br>
KIRK: The night is young. You said it yourself. It was logical. Peace is worth a few personal risks. ...You're a great one for logic. I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread. We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between us. ...I couldn't get past the death of my son.<br>
SPOCK: I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.<br>
KIRK: Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.<br>
SPOCK: Is it possible ...that we two, you and I, have grown so old and so inflexible ...that we have outlived our usefulness? ...Would that constitute a joke?<br>
KIRK: Don't crucify yourself. It wasn't your fault.<br>
SPOCK: I was responsible.<br>
KIRK: For no actions but your own<br>
SPOCK: That is not what you said at your trial.<br>
KIRK: That was as Captain of a ship. Human beings...<br>
SPOCK: But Captain, we both know that I am not human.<br>
KIRK: Do you want to know something? ...Everybody's human.<br>
SPOCK: I find that remark ...insulting.<br>
KIRK: Come on, I need you.<br>

KIRK (OC): She's out here, somewhere.<br>
CHEKOV (OC): But if she's cloaked...<br>
KIRK: ...then all we have is a neutron radiation surge, and by the time we're close enough to record it we're ashes.<br>
SPOCK (OC): two oh nine, ...two oh six, ...two oh three...<br>

SPOCK: Gas. ...Gas, Captain. Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other vessel. We call it 'plasma' but whatever the Klingon designation is, it is merely ionised gas.<br>
