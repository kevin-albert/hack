was nothing I could do for Jadzia. <br>
(The Pah wraith leaving Dukat and the wormhole collapsing in on
itself.) <br>
WEYOUN: Federation soldiers have landed on Cardassian soil and now
you're telling me the wormhole is gone and with it any chance of
getting reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant. <br>
SISKO: The station's all yours, Major. Let's go home, Jake. <br>
MARTOK: I need a first officer for a dangerous mission. <br>
WORF: How dangerous? <br>
MARTOK: Dangerous enough to assure Jadzia a place in Sto-vo-kor. <br>
SISKO: I had a vision from the Prophets. I was on Tyree, in the desert,
and I uncovered a face. The face of a woman. <br>
SISKO: You had a wife before Mum? <br>
JOSEPH: Sarah was your mother. <br>
KIRA: You're to begin an immediate evacuation. <br>
CRETAK: I'm afraid that's impossible. <br>
KIRA: Either you remove those weapons, or we will. <br>
EZRI: Hello, Benjamin. <br>
SISKO: Do I know you? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Dax? I can't believe it. <br>
EZRI: I can hardly believe it myself. But I'm Dax. I mean, I'm not
Jadzia Dax. I'm Ezri Dax. But I have all of Jadzia's memories. Not to
mention Lela's, Tobin's, Emony's, Audrid's, Joran's, Curzon's. Am I
forgetting anyone? <br>
SISKO: Torias. <br>
EZRI: Right. You're probably asking yourself who is this person? How
did she get the symbiont? Do I even want another Dax in my life? Does
she always talk this much? These are all very good questions and I wish
I had good answers for you. <br>
SISKO: The answers can wait. Right now, I'm just glad to see you. <br>
EZRI: Really? That is so nice of you to say. I'm not usually this
emotional. It must be the Emony in me. At least I think it's Emony Hi,
Jake. <br>
JAKE: Hi. <br>
EZRI: You seem taller. Or am I shorter? You know, none of this was my
idea. I never wanted to be joined. <br>
JAKE: Then how did you get the symbiont? <br>
EZRI: It was an accident. <br>
JOSEPH: Some accident. <br>
EZRI: I was on the Destiny when they brought the Dax symbiont aboard to
be taken back to Trill. Halfway through the trip, the symbiont took a
turn for the worse and needed to be placed in a host immediately. <br>
SISKO: And you were the only Trill on board. <br>
EZRI: I laid down on that operating table one person and I woke up a
completely different person. Well, I should say eight different people.
I was not prepared for this at all. I mean, you're supposed to get
years of training and preparation before you get joined, and all I got
was a fifteen minute lecture from the ship's surgeon and he wasn't even
a Trill. <br>
SISKO: I'm starting to see the problem. Please. <br>
(Ezri sits.) <br>
EZRI: You don't how much better I feel just being here with you, Ben. <br>
SISKO: What about the Symbiosis Institute? Weren't they able to do
anything for you? <br>
EZRI: I did meet with the Evaluation Board several times. <br>
SISKO: And? <br>
EZRI: They gave me some books to read, some counselling, but once a
host and symbiont are joined, there's really not very much they can do.
My parents, my friends, my crewmates, it's like they don't even know me
anymore. Which is understandable since I hardly even know myself.
That's why I took a leave of absence to come here. I knew that if there
is anyone who can help me through this, it would be you. <br>
SISKO: I'll do all I can, but the truth is, we're leaving for Tyree. <br>
EZRI: Fine. I'll come with you. <br>
JAKE: You don't even know why we're going. <br>
EZRI: It doesn't matter. When do we leave? <br>
SISKO: Today. <br>
EZRI: Great. It'll be just like old times. Except different.

O'BRIEN: What's he doing here? <br>
QUARK: Same thing you are. I'm volunteering for this mission. <br>
MARTOK: Why? You're a bartender, not a warrior. <br>
QUARK: True, but I loved Jadzia as much as anyone in this room. With
maybe one or two exceptions. And I am willing to pledge my life to see
that she gets into Sto-vo-kor. <br>
MARTOK: Perhaps there is some Klingon in you after all. <br>
QUARK: I wouldn't go that far. So why all the cutlery? <br>
MARTOK: We shed our blood to prove we are not frightened of death. <br>

<br>
EZRI: This is so embarrassing. <br>
SISKO: Don't worry, it's not your fault. <br>
EZRI: I'm a trained Starfleet officer. I've no business getting space
sick. But ever since I was given the symbiont, warp speed does make me
a little queasy. <br>
JAKE: A little queasy? <br>
JOSEPH: The main thing is the control panel's all cleaned up, so if one
of you would like to get back into the pilot's seat, it would sure make
me feel better. Not that I don't trust the computer. <br>
JAKE: You just prefer the human touch. <br>
JOSEPH: Do you need to lie down? <br>
EZRI: No, I'm fine, really. <br>
JOSEPH: Well, it's time for my nap. <br>
(Joseph leaves.) <br>
JAKE: You're sure you're okay? <br>
EZRI: But I just wish I could stop thinking about Torias. <br>
JAKE: Torias Dax? He was one of the previous hosts, wasn't he? <br>
EZRI: He died in a shuttle accident. I still remember the last few
seconds before the crash. Maybe I don't belong in Starfleet anymore.
Aren't you glad you brought me along? <br>
(Ezri goes to the replicator, and Jake follows.) <br>
JAKE: Actually, I am. My dad seems a lot happier ever since you showed
up. <br>
EZRI: One iced raktajino. I know you've been worried about your father,
Jake, but he's going to be all right. <br>
JAKE: What makes you so sure? <br>
EZRI: Because I've known him a long time. Besides, it's my job to know
these things. I'm a ship's counsellor. Well, actually, an assistant
ship's counsellor. <br>
JAKE: You're a therapist? <br>
EZRI: Is it that surprising? <br>
JAKE: A little. <br>
EZRI: You know, I wasn't always this confused. Before I was joined I
was considered to be a very promising young officer. That is horrible.
I hate raktajino. <br>
JAKE: Then why'd you order it? <br>
EZRI: Because Curzon liked it. <br>
JAKE: So did Jadzia. <br>
EZRI: Well, I don't. I have to learn to control some of these urges.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSS: I want you to know, Colonel, that I'm as
outraged as you are. The Romulans have no business placing weapons on
Derna. <br>
KIRA: I'm glad we're in agreement. What are we going to do about it? <br>
ROSS: The Federation has already sent a formal protest to the Romulan
Senate condemning their actions. <br>
KIRA: Well that's a start. What happens next? <br>
ROSS: They've already sent a protest of our protest. Politics. <br>
KIRA: You still haven't answered my question. <br>
ROSS: I don't know, Colonel. Eventually, the Romulans will remove the
weapons. <br>
KIRA: When? Are we talking about days, weeks, months? <br>
ROSS: I don't know but it will happen. <br>
KIRA: Now you sound like a politician, Admiral. <br>
ROSS: Maybe so. But facts are facts, Colonel. And there's no way the
Bajorans can drive the Romulans off Derna, not without help anyway, and
the Federation isn't going to provide that help. Not now. Is that
clear? <br>
KIRA: We're just not as important to the war effort as the Romulans. <br>
ROSS: That's a harsh way to put it. <br>
KIRA: The truth often is. <br>
ROSS: Colonel, I would like to help you, but my hands are tied. <br>
KIRA: Well, luckily, mine aren't. <br>
ROSS: Meaning what? <br>
KIRA: Our scans show that the weapons aren't fully operational yet.
They're still missing launch sequencers. I'm going to make sure that
those sequencers never reach Derna. <br>
ROSS: How? <br>
KIRA: I'm going to set up a blockade. <br>
ROSS: If you do that, Colonel, you'll have a fight on your hands. A
fight you can't win.

You are not here to help Jadzia get into Sto-vo-kor. You are here
because you wish to convince yourselves that you were worthy of her.
But the truth is, none of you could ever hope to be worthy of her or
even understand the kind of woman she was. It is you who should be

O'BRIEN: That's why you didn't want us on this mission with you. You
wanted to get her into Sto-vo-kor without our help. <br>
WORF: I wanted it to be my gift to her. <br>
QUARK: Go on. <br>
WORF: There is nothing more to say. Except that I am pleased you're
here. <br>
O'BRIEN: I have never heard Worf apologise to anyone. <br>
QUARK: I don't know about you, but I was hoping for something a little
more intriguing. <br>
BASHIR: Such as? <br>
QUARK: You know, like Jadzia used to call my name out when she slept,
or wanted to name her first child after me. <br>
MARTOK: Chief. The Monac shipyard. <br>

BENNY: Oh, it is to me. If I don't finish my story, if Captain Sisko
doesn't open the Orb box, then he cannot contact the Prophets. <br>
WYKOFF: It doesn't matter, Benny. The Prophets don't exist either.
They're all figments of your imagination. Get rid of them. It's the
