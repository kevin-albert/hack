<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GARAK: What a waste of a morning. That Galipotan
freighter that was scheduled to be here at oh seven hundred still
hasn't arrived. Oh well, that's the price of doing business with a
culture that refuses to even acknowledge the concept of time. Though I
must say, they make magnificent sweaters. I hope I'm not boring you,
Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: Oh, not at all. No, I was just up late last night. <br>
GARAK: Entertaining one of your lady friends? <br>
BASHIR: Unfortunately, no. I was reading the last few chapters of The
Never-Ending Sacrifice. <br>
GARAK: Isn't it superb? Without a doubt the finest Cardassian novel
ever written. <br>
BASHIR: I'll take your word for it. <br>
GARAK: So you didn't enjoy it? <br>
BASHIR: Well, I thought it was interesting. Maybe a little dull in
parts.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The place is packed out and people are queuing.) <br>
GARAK: Oh, wonderful. At this rate, we'll be done eating lunch just in
time for dinner. <br>
BASHIR: There's always Quark's. <br>
GARAK: True, but I'm really not in the mood for noisy, crowded and
vulgar today. <br>
BASHIR: Then I suppose the Klingon restaurant is out of the question. <br>
GARAK: I can't believe that I'm having lunch with a man who thinks The
Never-Ending Sacrifice is dull. <br>
BASHIR: I just thought the story got a little redundant after a while.
I mean the author's supposed to be chronicling seven generations of a
single family, but he tells the same story over and over again. All of
his characters lead selfless lives of duty to the state, grow old and
die. Then the next generation comes along and does it all over again. <br>
GARAK: But that's exactly the point, Doctor. The repetitive epic is the
most elegant form of Cardassian literature, and The Never-Ending
Sacrifice is it's greatest achievement. <br>
BASHIR: None of his characters ever really come alive, and there's more
to life than duty to the state. <br>
GARAK: A Federation viewpoint if ever I heard one. This is ridiculous.
Can't you just move to the front of the line? Tell them it's a medical
emergency or something. <br>
BASHIR: We'll be there in a minute. Look, maybe if you lent me another
book by a different writer. <br>
GARAK: It would only be a waste of time. When it comes to art, you're
obviously a prisoner of Federation dogma and human prejudice. <br>
BASHIR: I'm sorry you feel that way. I was just trying <br>
(Garak winces and holds his head in pain) <br>
BASHIR: Are you all right? <br>
GARAK: I'm fine. <br>
BASHIR: You don't look fine. Your skin is clammy and your pupils are
contracted. <br>
GARAK: I assure you, I'm in perfect health. Now, you were asking about
other Cardassian books. Something maybe a little more accessible <br>
(more pain) <br>
BASHIR: Perfect health. Then Cardassian standards must be a little
lower than mine. Come on. <br>
GARAK: Doctor, what do you think you're doing? <br>
BASHIR: I'm taking you to the Infirmary. <br>
GARAK: That won't be necessary. <br>
BASHIR: Maybe not, but humour me. <br>
GARAK: Frankly, Doctor, I'm a little tired of humouring you. There's
nothing wrong with me that a little peace and privacy wouldn't cure.
Now if you'll excuse me, I seem to have lost my appetite. <br>
KIRA: What was that all about? <br>
BASHIR: I have no idea.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Julian is scanning a spiky cone poking out of moss
with spikes.) <br>
DAX: Can you tell what's wrong with it? <br>
BASHIR: In my expert medical opinion, I'd say It's sick. <br>
DAX: I know that, but why is it sick? <br>
BASHIR: I'm a doctor, not a botanist. Did you ask Professor O'Brien? <br>
DAX: Keiko's at a hydroponics conference on Rigel Four. She won't be
back for a week. <br>
BASHIR: And none of your past hosts have had any experience with
plants? <br>
DAX: Daxes have never been much on gardening. Tobin was the only one
who ever tried his hand at it, but he had even less luck with plants
than he did with women. <br>
BASHIR: Do you even know where it's from? <br>
DAX: I picked it up on Ledonia Three. <br>
BASHIR: May I? <br>
DAX: Be my guest. <br>
(He uses the computer console to download his scans) <br>
BASHIR: That explains it. Ledonian soil contains a benevolent
mycorrhizal fungus that helps the native plants retain water. But the
fungus in this potting soil's almost completely died out. If we can
salvage what's left and cultivate a new batch in the lab, that should
do the trick. <br>
DAX: Keiko would be proud of you. <br>
BASHIR: It's all there on the screen. I only wish my humanoid patients
were as easy to treat. <br>
DAX: Did Chief O'Brien dislocate his shoulder again? <br>
BASHIR: It's Garak. At lunch today, he seemed as though he was going to
have some kind of seizure. He was having trouble
breathing and he appeared to be in a great deal of pain. When I tried
to get him to come to the Infirmary, he outright refused. <br>
DAX: Maybe he just doesn't like going to see the doctor. <br>
BASHIR: That's not it. It's that damn Cardassian evasiveness of his. I
mean, making me guess about his past is one thing, but when it comes to
his health? I don't know. Why can't he just tell me what's going on? <br>
DAX: It sounds like you're taking this personally. <br>
BASHIR: I suppose I am. It's just that Garak and I have been having
lunch together once a week for more than a year now. You'd think he'd
come to trust me a little. <br>
DAX: Why should he? It's not like you two are really friends. <br>
BASHIR: No, of course not. I suppose when it comes right down to it, I
don't trust him either. I mean, for all I know, the man is a Cardassian
spy. <br>
DAX: Exactly. <br>
BASHIR: Exactly. If he doesn't want my help, that's his prerogative.

GARAK: Too long. <br>
QUARK: And in all that time, have I ever let you down? <br>
GARAK: I have never done business with you until now. <br>
QUARK: Which is why this deal is so important to me. I want our

BASHIR: You and Garak going into business? I couldn't help overhearing
your conversation. <br>
QUARK: Oh, that. I'm helping Garak get a new sizing scanner for his
shop. <br>
BASHIR: A sizing scanner? <br>
QUARK: Not just any sizing scanner. The best. Straight from Merak Two.
Calibrated to be accurate down to the micrometer. And, I might add, at
a very reasonable price. <br>
BASHIR: Really? I thought Garak sounded a bit upset. <br>
QUARK: Upset? Garak? I hadn't noticed. Now, is there anything I can do
for you? A little Saurian brandy to go, or maybe a late night session

BASHIR: Yes. I was hoping you could give me a hand. I've been trying to
access the old Cardassian medical files but I haven't been having much
luck. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm not surprised. The Cardassians did a general systems sweep
before they pulled out. The medical files would have been deleted along
with everything else. <br>
BASHIR: Is there any way to recover them? <br>
O'BRIEN: Maybe. These subroutines don't look anywhere near as bad as
the engineering files did. I might be able to reconstruct the data by
microscanning the purge trace. <br>
BASHIR: How long will that take? <br>
O'BRIEN: Two, maybe three weeks. <br>

your liquor
is severely overstating the case. <br>

QUARK: He came in complaining about a headache. The next thing I knew
he drank up half my stock of kanar. <br>

BASHIR: Apparently. <br>
ODO: What's it for? <br>
BASHIR: Well, I was hoping you could tell me. After working for the
Cardassians for five years, I'd guess you know them as well as anyone. <br>
ODO: Maybe so, but I never bothered to look inside their skulls. <br>
BASHIR: No, I don't suppose you did. <br>
ODO: Do you think this is the cause of Garak's condition? <br>
BASHIR: It's possible. Whatever this thing is, it's situated in his
postcentral gyrus and has filaments that connect it to his entire
central nervous system. <br>
ODO: Maybe it's some kind of punishment device. A parting gift from the
Cardassian government. <br>
BASHIR: I thought of that, but based on the amount of scarring in the
surrounding tissue, this implant's been in there for years. And as far
as I can tell, Garak's only been in pain for the past few days. <br>
ODO: Interesting. I wish I had an answer for you, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: Well, I was hoping you could help me get one. I think Quark
knows what this thing is. <br>
ODO: Now what makes you say that? <br>
BASHIR: I overheard them talking the other night. Garak was negotiating
to buy some merchandise from Quark. He seemed pretty desperate. I tried
to ask Quark what it was about, but <br>
ODO: No need to explain, Doctor. The direct approach seldom works with
people like him. This could answer some of my own questions. Quark has
sent several coded messages to Cardassia Prime in the past few days. <br>
BASHIR: Really? <br>
ODO: I routinely monitor all of Quark's subspace communications. <br>
BASHIR: Is that legal? <br>
ODO: It's in the best interests of station security. Doctor, do you
want to know what Quark knows or not? <br>

makes his clandestine calls after the bar closes. <br>

GARAK: My dear Doctor, I have no intention of putting myself on display
for the amusement of the Bajoran inhabitants of this station. <br>

carrying around inside your head. <br>

BASHIR: It's some kind of punishment device, isn't it? <br>
GARAK: Punishment device? I suppose in a way that's what it's become. <br>
BASHIR: If it wasn't put there to punish you, then what's it for?
Garak, I need to know what we're up against. If you tell me what it was
meant for, maybe I could find some way to remove it. <br>
GARAK: It's hopeless, Doctor. Believe me, it can't be removed. <br>
BASHIR: How do you know? <br>
GARAK: That's the whole point. If it could be easily removed, it would
be useless. You see, on Cardassia I was entrusted with certain
information. Information that needed to be kept safe regardless of the
situation. My implant was given to me by Enabran Tain himself, the head
of the Obsidian Order. If I was ever tortured, it was designed to
stimulate the pleasure centres of my brain to trigger the production of
vast amounts of natural endorphins. I do hope you appreciate the irony,
Doctor. The sole purpose of the implant was to make me immune to pain. <br>
BASHIR: What caused it to malfunction? <br>
GARAK: It was never meant for continuous use. <br>
BASHIR: Continuous use? What do you mean? <br>
GARAK: Living on this station is torture for me, Doctor. The
temperature is always too cold, the lights always too bright. Every
Bajoran on the station looks at me with loathing and contempt. So one
day I decided I couldn't live with it anymore, and I took the pain
away. <br>
BASHIR: You activated the implant. <br>
GARAK: I created a device which allowed me to trigger the implant
whenever I wanted. At first, I only used it a few minutes a day, but I
began relying on it more and more until finally I just turned it on and
never shut it off. <br>
BASHIR: How long has it been on? <br>
GARAK: Two years. <br>
BASHIR: And now the implant is breaking down. <br>
GARAK: That's correct. <br>
BASHIR: Then why not just shut the damn thing off? <br>
GARAK: It's too late, now. My body has become completely dependent on
the higher endorphin levels generated by the implant. <br>
BASHIR: So, that's it then. You're going to just give up and let them
win. <br>
GARAK: Them, Doctor? <br>
BASHIR: The Central Command, the Obsidian Order, whoever it is who
exiled you here. You're just going to roll over and die, let them
destroy you, give up any hope of ever seeing Cardassia again. <br>
GARAK: Doctor, did anyone ever tell you that you are an infuriating
pest? <br>
BASHIR: Chief O'Brien all the time, and I don't pay any attention to
him either. <br>
GARAK: Has it ever occurred to you that I might be getting exactly what
I deserve? <br>
BASHIR: No one deserves this. <br>
GARAK: Oh, please, Doctor. I'm suffering enough without having to
listen to your smug Federation sympathy. Do you think because we have
lunch together once a week, you know me? You couldn't even begin to
fathom what I'm capable of. <br>
BASHIR: I'm a doctor. You're my patient. That's all I need to know. <br>
GARAK: Wrong again. You need to know who you're trying to save. During
the occupation, I was a Gul in the Cardassian Mechanised Infantry. We
were stationed just outside the Bajoran Capital. Shortly before the
withdrawal, a handful of Bajoran prisoners escaped from my custody. My
aide, a man named Elim, tracked them to a Cardassian shuttle about to
depart for Terok Nor. Elim got aboard, but the captain refused to let
him search the ship, because he claimed he was under strict orders from
Gul Dukat to depart immediately. So I had the shuttle destroyed,
killing the escapees, Elim, and ninety seven Cardassian civilians. <br>
BASHIR: You can't be serious. <br>
GARAK: I followed my orders. None of those prisoners escaped off of
Bajor alive. Unfortunately as it turned out, one of the passengers on
the shuttle was the daughter of a prominent military official. I was
stripped of my rank and commission, and exiled from Cardassia. So now
you know, Doctor. I hope I haven't shattered too many of your
illusions. <br>
BASHIR: Listen to me, Garak. Right now I'm not concerned with what you
did in the past. I'm simply not going to walk out of here and let you
die. We need to turn that implant off and whatever withdrawal symptoms
or side effects you may experience, I promise I'll help you through
them. I need to know where that triggering device is. Where is it? <br>
GARAK: The desk, second drawer. <br>
(Later, Garak is on a bed with the device on his head and a medic
present.) <br>
BASHIR: That'll be all for now. If you need to reach me, I'll be here
for at least the next twenty six hours. <br>
(The medic leaves) <br>
BASHIR: Computer I'm reading an ongoing erosion of tissue in the
patient's lymphatic system. Explain. <br>
COMPUTER: Unable to determine a cause due to insufficient data on
Cardassian physiology. <br>
BASHIR: All right. Continue to monitor the status of the patient's
cranial implant. Inform me if it shows any sign of reactivation. <br>
(doorbell) <br>
BASHIR: Yes? <br>
ODO: Doctor, I was hoping I could ask Garak some questions. <br>
BASHIR: He's asleep. He has been ever since I turned off his implant.
Come on, we can talk outside. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: Doctor, I need to talk to him as soon as
possible. I have four cases left in my homicide files which I'm almost
certain were committed by the Obsidian Order. If Garak was a member he
may be able to shed some light on them. <br>
BASHIR: I'm afraid your questions will have to wait. <br>
ODO: How long? <br>
BASHIR: I don't know yet. Constable, Garak's body has undergone a
severe shock. I don't know when he'll recover. I'm not even sure if
he'll recover. <br>
ODO: In that case I want to talk to him now. Wake him up. <br>
BASHIR: I'll do no such thing. <br>
ODO: Doctor, these are murder cases and Garak may be a suspect. <br>
BASHIR: That may be so, but he's still my patient and I won't have him
disturbed. So until further notice, his quarters are off limits to
everyone except emergency medical personnel. So, if you'll excuse me, I
have a patient to attend to.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(time passes in a series of fades. Bashir gets a
drink from the replicator, Garak is restless, Bashir sleeps in the
chair. Garak wakes up, crying.) <br>
BASHIR: Garak? <br>
GARAK: Leave me alone. <br>
BASHIR: I don't think that would be a good idea right now. Your blood
chemistry is severely imbalanced. You need to rest. <br>
GARAK: Don't touch me. <br>
BASHIR: Just calm down. <br>
GARAK: I don't want to be calm, Doctor. I've been calm long enough.
Look at this place. It's pathetic. To think that this is what my life
has been reduced to. This sterile shell, this prison. <br>
(Garak smashes a flower vase) <br>
BASHIR: Take it easy, Garak. Look, you're obviously experiencing some
side effects from the deactivation of the implant. <br>
GARAK: Ridiculous. I feel more clear-headed than I have in the past two
years. Two years. What a waste these past two years have been. <br>
(Garak overturns a table) <br>
GARAK: There was a time, Doctor, oh there was a time when I was a
power. The protégé
of Enabran Tain himself. Do you have any idea what that means? <br>
BASHIR: I'm afraid I don't. <br>
GARAK: No, you don't, do you. You don't know much of anything. Tain was
the Obsidian Order. Not even the Central Command dared challenge him.
And I was his right hand. My future was limitless until I threw it
away. <br>
BASHIR: You mean when you had that shuttle shot down to stop those
prisoners from escaping? <br>
GARAK: Stop them? I only wish that I had stopped them. <br>
BASHIR: You didn't? <br>
GARAK: No, Doctor, my disgrace was worse than that. Unimaginably worse.
<br>
BASHIR: What could you have possibly done worse than that? <br>
GARAK: I let them go. It was the eve of the Cardassian withdrawal. Elim
and I were interrogating five Bajorans. They were children, Doctor.
None of them were older than fourteen years old. They knew nothing.
They lived in bombed-out rooms, scrounged for food on the streets. They
were filthy and they stank. The room was freezing cold, the air was
like ice, and suddenly the whole exercise seemed utterly meaningless.
All I wanted was a hot bath and a good meal. So I let them go. I gave
them whatever latinum I had in my pockets, and opened the door, and
flung them back into the street. Elim couldn't believe his eyes. He
looked at me as if I were insane. <br>
BASHIR: You took pity on those children. There's nothing wrong with
that. <br>
GARAK: No! I was a fool! I should've finished the interrogation and
turned them over to the troops for execution. But because I was chilly
and my stomach was growling, I failed in my duty and destroyed
everything I had worked for. <br>
BASHIR: And so they exiled you. <br>
GARAK: That's right. And left me to live out my days with nothing to
look forward to but having lunch with you. <br>
BASHIR: I'm sorry you feel that way. I thought you enjoyed my company. <br>
GARAK: I did. And that's the worst part. I can't believe that I
actually enjoyed eating mediocre food and staring into at your smug,
sanctimonious face. I hate this place and I hate you. <br>
BASHIR: Okay, Garak, that's your prerogative. Now I really think you
should lie down. <br>
GARAK: Get away from me. <br>
BASHIR: Garak. <br>
(Garak comes at him in fury and they break furniture.) <br>
BASHIR: Garak, stop this. I don't want to hurt you. <br>
(Garak is about to strangle Bashir when he has a fit) <br>
BASHIR: Bashir to Infirmary. I need an emergency medical team in
Garak's quarters now.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: Administer another twenty cc's of
hyperzine. <br>
JABARA: (Bajoran nurse) He's not responding. <br>
BASHIR: Give it a second. Begin cardiostimulation. <br>
JABARA: His heartbeat is stabilising. <br>
BASHIR: But his lymphatic system is critical. I don't understand it. I
shut down the implant. It can't be affecting his blood chemistry
anymore, yet toxins are still accumulating in his lymphatic tissues.
Computer, display analyses of all biochemical samples taken from the
patient in the past thirty-nine hours. Display them by chemical
composition. Isolate and display sample number seventeen. Bring up
sample twenty three. Sample twenty seven. Sample thirty two. Sample
thirty five. Sample forty. Stop. Bring back sample thirty five.
Superimpose the molecular structure of this leukocyte with an analogous
sample from yesterday. That's it. The molecular structure of Garak's
leukocytes has been altered. That must be what's causing the
accumulation of toxins in his system. <br>
JABARA: Can we synthesise Cardassian leukocytes? <br>
BASHIR: Probably, but that could take weeks and we don't have that much
time. We have three or fours days at most. <br>
JABARA: If we turn the implant back on, we might be able to keep him
alive for another week or two. <br>
GARAK: No. <br>
BASHIR: What? <br>
GARAK: I won't allow it. I never want that thing turned on again. <br>
BASHIR: I understand how you feel, but I'm not sure what else I can do
for you. <br>
GARAK: You've done enough, Doctor. More than I deserve. There's
something you have to know. <br>
BASHIR: What's that? <br>
GARAK: The truth. <br>
BASHIR: I've about given up on learning the truth from you, Garak. <br>
GARAK: Don't give up on me now, Doctor. Patience has its rewards. Now
listen carefully. Elim wasn't my aide. He was my friend. We grew up
together. We were closer than brothers. For some reason, Enabran Tain
took a liking to us. Before long, we were both powerful men in the
Obsidian Order. They called us the Sons of Tain. Even the Guls feared
us. And then there was a scandal. Someone in the Order was accused of
letting some Bajoran prisoners escape. There were constant rumours of
who was going to be implicated. Fingers were being pointed at me. By
then Tain had retired to the Arawath Colony. He couldn't protect me, so
I panicked. I did everything in my power to make sure that Elim was
accused instead of me. I altered records, planted evidence, only to
discover that he'd beaten me to it. <br>
BASHIR: He betrayed you first? <br>
GARAK: Elim destroyed me. Before I knew what was going on, I was
sentenced to exile. And the irony is, I deserved it. Oh, not for the
reasons they claimed, but because of what I had tried to do to Elim, my
best friend. <br>
BASHIR: Why are you telling me this, Garak? <br>
GARAK: So that you can forgive me. Why else? I need to know that
someone forgives me. <br>
BASHIR: I forgive you for whatever it is you did. <br>
GARAK: Thank you, Doctor. That's most kind. <br>
BASHIR: See that he rests comfortably. I'll be back within fifty two
hours. <br>
JABARA: Where are you going? <br>
BASHIR: To find the man responsible for this.

TAIN: Doctor Bashir. Welcome. Please make yourself at home. <br>
(After the break) <br>
TAIN: Well, Doctor, you've come all this way to see me. Aren't you
going to say something? <br>
BASHIR: How did you know my name? <br>
TAIN: Information's my business. <br>
BASHIR: You're Enabran Tain. <br>
TAIN: And you're Doctor Julian Subatoi Bashir. I hope you weren't
greeted too rudely upon entering Cardassian space. <br>
BASHIR: Not nearly as rudely as I expected. <br>
TAIN: Good. I alerted them that you'd be coming. The military hates
surprises. Still, what you did was very brave. I'm impressed. Can I get
you something to drink? Tarkalean tea perhaps? <br>
BASHIR: I always drink Tarkalean tea. <br>
TAIN: A good host knows the needs of his guests. One Tarkalean tea,
extra sweet, and a glass of kanar. So, Lieutenant, how's Garak? Has his
condition improved at all? <br>
BASHIR: That Cardassian Quark was talking to, Boheeka, I suppose he
really did have a reason to fear the Obsidian Order. <br>
TAIN: Everyone has reason to fear the Order. <br>
BASHIR: I don't understand it. Garak told me you were retired. <br>
TAIN: Oh, I am. Have been for years. But I try to keep informed on
current events. I bet you could tell me all kinds of things I'd like to
know, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: I'm sure I could. I'll tell you anything you want to know about
medicine, biology or tennis. Do you want to hear my opinion on the
latest nillimite alloy rackets? <br>
TAIN: I don't think that will be necessary. <br>
BASHIR: Have it your way. <br>
TAIN: Are all the Starfleet Lieutenants as brash as you are? <br>
BASHIR: I couldn't say, though I doubt it. <br>
TAIN: So do I. Tell me, Doctor, how sick is Garak? <br>
BASHIR: He's dying. <br>
TAIN: And you're trying to save him. <br>
BASHIR: That's right. <br>
TAIN: Strange. I thought you were his friend. <br>
BASHIR: I suppose I am. <br>
TAIN: Then you should let him die. After all, for Garak, a life in
exile is no life at all. <br>
BASHIR: Say what you will, my job is to keep him alive, and I need your
help. <br>
TAIN: My help? What can I do? <br>
BASHIR: The molecular structure of Garak's leukocytes has been
disrupted. I need to synthesise replacements in order to stabilise his
condition. Unfortunately, my knowledge of Cardassian biochemistry is
severely limited. <br>
TAIN: And you think I have access to that kind of information? <br>
BASHIR: Information is your business. Besides, you're the one who
ordered him to put that implant put in his head, aren't you? <br>
TAIN: I never had to order Garak to do anything. That's what made him
special. So, you're saying if you don't get the information, Garak
dies? <br>
BASHIR: That's it. <br>
TAIN: Well, we can't allow that can we? I'll see to it that the
necessary data is transferred to your station's computers. <br>
BASHIR: Thank you. <br>
TAIN: Don't thank me. I'm not doing Garak any favours. He doesn't
deserve a quick death. On the contrary, I want him to live a long,
miserable life. I want him to grow old on that station, surrounded by
people who hate him, knowing that he'll never come home again. <br>
BASHIR: What a lovely sentiment. <br>
TAIN: And it's from the heart, I assure you. And now, Doctor, I really
think you should be going. <br>
BASHIR: One last thing. <br>
TAIN: Make it brief. <br>
BASHIR: Garak mentioned an old friend of his the other day, a member of
the Obsidian Order. I was wondering what happened to him. <br>
TAIN: Did he give you the name of this friend? <br>
BASHIR: He said it was Elim. <br>
TAIN: (chuckling) Elim? <br>
BASHIR: Mind letting me in on the joke? <br>
TAIN: I can see that Garak hasn't changed a bit. Never tells the truth
when a lie will do. That man has a rare gift for obfuscation. Doctor,
Elim is Garak's first name. Now run along home. And please, tell Garak
that I miss him. <br>
BASHIR: I'll be sure to give him the message. Computer, one to beam up.
Energise.

So, how's the I'danian spice pudding today? <br>
BASHIR: How's the spice pudding? Is that all you have to say for
yourself? How can you just sit there and pretend that the last ten days
never happened? <br>
GARAK: I for one, Doctor, am perfectly satisfied with the way things
turned out. And I see no need to dwell on what was doubtlessly a
difficult time for both of us. By the way, I just had the most
interesting conversation with Constable Odo. It seems he's under the
impression that I was a member of the Obsidian Order. <br>

GARAK: That he was mistaken, of course. <br>
BASHIR: And he believed you? <br>

future. I told him to be my guest, I have nothing to hide. Here. I've
brought you something. <br>

GARAK: Meditations on a Crimson Shadow by Preloc. <br>
BASHIR: More Cardassian literature. <br>
GARAK: I think you'll find this one more to your tastes. It takes place
in the future during a time when Cardassia and the Klingon Empire are
at war. <br>
BASHIR: Who wins? <br>
GARAK: Who do you think? <br>
BASHIR: Never mind, don't tell me. I don't want you to spoil the
ending. You know, I still have a lot of questions to ask you about your
past. <br>
GARAK: I've given you all the answers I'm capable of. <br>
BASHIR: You gave me answers, all right, but they were all different.
What I want to know is of all the stories you told me, which ones were
true and which ones weren't? <br>
GARAK: My dear Doctor, they're all true. <br>
BASHIR: Even the lies? <br>
