BASHIR: Easy there, Chief. You have a mild case of radiation poisoning.
I've given you some hyronalin, which should counteract the affects. But
I think he should be restricted to light duty for the next few days. <br>
SISKO: Agreed. <br>
KIRA: Commander, the transport's arrived and they're requesting

their freighter was damaged and they need a complete overhaul before
they can continue back to the Klingon Empire. <br>

you some asinolyathin for the pain. <br>
O'BRIEN: What about the vision I had? <br>
BASHIR: Well, mild hallucinations are also a fairly common side-effect
of radiation poisoning. <br>
O'BRIEN: It was anything but mild. I really felt I was standing on the
Promenade watching myself talking to Quark. <br>
BASHIR: What was the conversation about? <br>
O'BRIEN: He was complaining about some Klingons. He said they'd damaged
two of his holosuites. <br>
BASHIR: Well, you do have one problem. If all you can hallucinate about

to the Alpha Quadrant in the last century. We need more information on
its military capabilities. How many ships do they have? Where are they
deployed? What are their plans for the future? Are they planning an
attack? <br>
SISKO: We don't know any of that yet. <br>
KARINA: You have one of the Founders of the Dominion on this very
station. He should be able to tell us everything we need to know about
their intentions. <br>
KIRA: Odo is not one of the Founders. <br>
KARINA: Your own reports indicate that a group of changelings are the
real source of power behind the Dominion. <br>
KIRA: Yes. <br>
RUWON: And Odo is a changeling. <br>
KIRA: But he's not one of the Founder. <br>
RUWON: I fail to see the distinction. <br>
KIRA: Odo made a conscious choice to stay here with us. He has no
loyalties to the Dominion and he has no information about their plans. <br>
RUWON: We find that hard to believe. <br>
SISKO: It's the truth, whether you choose to believe it or not. <br>
RUWON: Commander, we allowed you to place one of our cloaking devices
on the Defiant in exchange for information regarding the Dominion. Now
you have the cloaking device and we have very little. <br>
KARINA: We shouldn't have to remind you of the importance both our
governments place on continuing to carry out this agreement. It's the
first treaty between Romulus and the Federation in many years. <br>
SISKO: I'm aware of that and I'm willing to cooperate with you in any
way I can. <br>
RUWON: Very well then. We want to see every piece of information
Starfleet has on the Dominion, no matter how insignificant. <br>
KARINA: That includes any classified reports you may have made to
Starfleet Command. <br>
SISKO: I'll have to clear that with Starfleet. <br>

find evidence of a minor temporal disturbance in Quark's and another
one later on the Promenade. Both disturbances happened at about the
same time as the Chief's experiences. <br>
SISKO: So it would seem that you did travel into the future and then
returned to the same moment that you left. <br>
O'BRIEN: Have you any idea what might have caused this time shift? <br>
DAX: Not yet. I want to go over the medical scans Julian took of you
earlier. That dose of ionising radiation you received might have
something to do with it. <br>

minute damage to his cerebrospinal nerve cells which might have been
caused by the time shifting. <br>
O'BRIEN: Can you repair it? <br>
BASHIR: Yes, but the effect is cumulative. If you keep time shifting,
there may come a point where the damage becomes irreparable.
Eventually, it might even kill you. <br>
SISKO: Don't worry, Chief. Dax is using every scanner on the station to
hunt for any temporal abnormalities. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, if anyone can find the cause of the time shifts, it's
Dax. <br>

on the Defiant when it was captured by the Founders. They're also still
not happy with the sensor information collected by the Defiant, so they
want unrestricted access to the Defiant. And they also want complete
access to all our personal logs. <br>
SISKO: Personal logs are out of the question, but they can have limited
access to the Defiant. I'll let them debrief us as well. I know they're
pushing us, Major, but consider their position. There have never been
any Romulan ships in the Gamma Quadrant, so they've never encountered
the Dominion. So they're completely dependent on us for information. <br>
KIRA: Well then maybe they should send their own ships through the
wormhole and find out for themselves. <br>
SISKO: The Romulans generally prefer to sit back and pull the strings
from a distance if they can. <br>
KIRA: This is one puppet who doesn't like her strings pulled. <br>
SISKO: I know. But like Ruwon said, they've lived up to their part of
the bargain. We have to do everything we can to live up to ours. <br>
KIRA: All right. I'll draw up a schedule of interviews and I'll tell
everyone to cooperate. <br>

heard, and I resent the implication! <br>
RUWON: You seem very agitated for someone who's proclaiming her
innocence. <br>
KARINA: Indeed, your emotional state would seem to indicate that our
theory is correct and you did abandon the Defiant prematurely when it
was attacked by the Jem'Hadar. <br>
KIRA: When the Defiant was attacked, Odo and I were trapped below
decks. There was a hand-to-hand fight in the corridor. I was wounded
and I lost consciousness. When I came to, Odo had already put me aboard
the shuttle and we had escaped. I did not abandon the ship prematurely.
<br>
RUWON: Why didn't Odo try to help the rest of the Defiant's crew? <br>
KIRA: well I'm sure he wanted to. But there was no way to get to the
Bridge and <br>
KARINA: Why were you in Odo's Quarters when the ship was attacked? <br>
KIRA: We were talking. <br>
KARINA: About what? <br>
KIRA: It's personal. <br>
RUWON: Do you often have personal talks with the changeling? <br>
KIRA: What business is that of yours? <br>
RUWON: We're trying to determine the nature of your relationship. <br>
KARINA: You are the only member of the Defiant's crew who was not taken
prisoner. Why? Did the Founders believe Odo would react badly if you
were harmed? Did they think you held some kind of attraction to him? <br>
RUWON: Has Odo ever shown some kind of physical interest in you, Major?
<br>
KIRA: That's it. You rip the cloaking device out of the Defiant right
now. I am not answering any more questions. And I suggest you avoid
asking Odo those questions or you just might find yourselves on the
other side of that bulkhead floating home.

telling us about the fight, you've changed the future. Security's here

going to be a fight. <br>
O'BRIEN: I know, I know. But I've seen it and I can't shake the feeling

you to about five hours into the future, we could also assume that the
incident you saw in this corridor moved you to about five hours into
the future. <br>
ODO: That means someone will place a device in this panel in the next
few hours. <br>
SISKO: All of these quarters are vacant at the moment. There are no
vital power conduits in this area, no crucial defence systems. Why

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAX: I've been scanning the area around the station
out to a radius of two kilometres, and I didn't find anything at first.
Then I started to
scan some of the lower subspace bandwidths. I found traces of low-level
tetryon emissions. <br>
O'BRIEN: I've never seen an emission pattern like that outside of a
neutron star. <br>
DAX: Or a quantum singularity. And singularities are known to send out
waves of temporal displacement. <br>
O'BRIEN: But if there is a singularity nearby why can't we find it? It
should also be affecting the gravimetric field signatures. <br>
DAX: I don't know. Maybe it's buried so far down in the subspace layers
that we can't detect it. <br>
SISKO: Assuming for the moment that a singularity is responsible, how
do we combat its effects on the Chief? <br>
BASHIR: The temporal displacement caused by a quantum singularity most
commonly affects delta series radioisotopes, which is exactly what the
Chief absorbed during the conduit breach. <br>
SISKO: So you're saying that it could be pulling O'Brien's body like a
magnet? <br>
BASHIR: Exactly. I think I may know a way to neutralise the remaining
radioisotopes in your body. <br>
DAX: Without the radiation, the temporal displacement might stop. <br>
BASHIR: It's going to take time. He may experience one or two more time
shifts before I can complete the process. <br>
O'BRIEN: When can we start? <br>
BASHIR: Right away. <br>
(O'Brien and Bashir leave.) <br>
SISKO: Keep trying to pinpoint the singularity. If it is out there, we
need to locate it and find a way to get rid of it. <br>
DAX: Right. <br>
KIRA: I wanted to let you know I moved the Romulans to different
quarters. <br>
SISKO: Oh? <br>
KIRA: It's the replicators again. I assigned a maintenance crew, but in
the meantime I moved the entire Romulan delegation to section forty
seven, level two in the Habitat ring. <br>
SISKO: Section forty seven? <br>
KIRA: Yes. Is something wrong? <br>
SISKO: The wall panel where O'Brien saw himself being killed is right
outside those quarters. Which means either the Romulans are going to
put a device in the bulkhead themselves or someone else will, possibly
to be used against the Romulans. <br>
KIRA: Should I move them to other quarters? <br>
SISKO: No. That'll warn whoever's responsible. But inform Odo of the
change in quarters. He already has that corridor under surveillance.

SISKO: Were you able to see who it was? <br>
ODO: No. We've been monitoring the corridor constantly for the past
three hours. No one's come anywhere near the panel. However, sensors
did detect a low energy transporter beam a short time ago. They beamed
the device directly into the wall. <br>
SISKO: That's a delicate piece of transporter work. <br>
ODO: Yes, it is. We haven't been able to trace the beam to its point of
origin, but since there aren't any ships nearby, I believe it
originated on the station. <br>

surveillance of the Romulans, my leading suspects would be the
Klingons. <br>

about watching myself being killed, feeling my own neck for a pulse
that wasn't there. <br>
BASHIR: Well, it could've been worse. It could've been me. <br>
QUARK: (bringing drinks) Here you are, gentlemen. And how is DS Nine's
most famous fortune teller? <br>
O'BRIEN: Don't call me that. I haven't told anyone's fortune. <br>
QUARK: Just a figure of speech. On the other hand, if you should find
yourself in the future again and you find yourself passing by the dabo
table, would it really hurt to take a look at the numbers coming up on
the wheel? I could make it worth your while. <br>
O'BRIEN: Let's get out of here. <br>
QUARK: Just a thought. <br>

BASHIR: Chief! Oh, am I glad to see you. <br>
O'BRIEN: What the hell happened to me, Julian? <br>
BASHIR: It was the radiation. I didn't realise it had damaged the
basilar arteries in your brain stem until it was too late. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well why not? <br>
BASHIR: It didn't show up on any of the diagnostics. I couldn't tell
what had happened until I was doing the autopsy. <br>
O'BRIEN: Autopsy? <br>
BASHIR: Yes. I just finished doing it a few moments ago. Do you want me
to show you the results? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, no, that's all right. <br>
BASHIR: Now look. When you go back to the past, ask me to perform a
basilar arterial scan. Now since you're going five hours back into the
past, I should have enough time to find the damage and repair it before
this happens. <br>
O'BRIEN: Right. How could you just let me die? <br>
BASHIR: I didn't just let you die. I did everything I could to keep you
alive for over an hour, but your body just gave up. <br>
O'BRIEN: Gave up? <br>
BASHIR: I'm sorry, Chief, but there comes a point when the human body

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: We finally were able to localise the
transporter beam and trace it back to this location. <br>
SISKO: These quarters have been vacant for weeks. <br>
ODO: Somehow, they overrode the security lock on the door to gain
access. <br>
SISKO: So what did they do? Bring in a portable transporter and beam
the surveillance equipment into the bulkhead? <br>
ODO: That was my first thought. But then I realised that a portable
transporter is a rather large and bulky piece of equipment to be
carrying around the halls. <br>
SISKO: That's true. <br>
ODO: So, then I began thinking about the replicator. <br>
SISKO: Ah. They realigned the matter-energy conversion matrix. <br>
ODO: Turning it into a small transporter. A very sophisticated, very
professional job. <br>
SISKO: So now we know how they did it, the next question is who? <br>
ODO: I think I have an answer to that as well. This device is
manufactured on Davlos Three, a planet on the Klingon border. In fact,
Davlos does over ninety percent of its trade with the Klingon Empire. <br>
SISKO: That's still very little evidence to make an arrest. <br>
ODO: Yes, it is. But then I contacted a friend at Starfleet
Intelligence who used to be assigned to the Federation Embassy on the
Klingon Homeworld. He put me in contact with a former Klingon operative
who's out of favour with the current administration. This former
operative sent me a series of reports <br>
SISKO: Odo, cut to the chase. <br>
ODO: The three Klingons now on the station are part of a covert strike
force that reports directly to the Klingon High Council. <br>
SISKO: Why didn't you just say so? <br>
ODO: Sometimes I have to remind you just how good I am. <br>
SISKO: So Gowron sent our three friends here and they're conducting
surveillance on the Romulan delegation. Why? Are they here to kill
them? <br>
ODO: Possibly. It's also possible that this is just a routine
intelligence-gathering operation. The high-energy laser that killed
O'Brien is simply a booby trap to prevent someone from tampering with
the device. It's not meant for assassination. <br>
SISKO: Well in either case I think we have enough evidence to at least
hold the Klingons for questioning, don't you? <br>
ODO: Absolutely. And I think I can question them until the Romulan
delegation leaves the station. <br>
SISKO: Just be careful. <br>
ODO: Commander, there is no careful way to question a Klingon.

ODO: We take a very dim view of spies and saboteurs on this station. <br>
MORKA: Now you slander us. When my family finds out what you have done,
they will come here and kill you! <br>
ODO: I doubt that very much. The only people who will be coming here
are your friends in Klingon Intelligence. And from what I understand,
they don't like being embarrassed by operatives who fail in their
missions. However, should you suddenly feel like cooperating, I may be
persuaded to let you go without contacting your friends in

have to wait a couple more hours before I give him the last treatment
but after that there should be no more time shifting. <br>
SISKO: What about the quantum singularity? <br>
DAX: We've been able to track it by using its tetryon emissions as a
guide. It seems to be orbiting Deep Space Nine in a roughly elliptical
fashion. <br>
O'BRIEN: At certain points in its orbit, the singularity radiates
temporal energy at a specific wavelength. That seems to be what
triggers my
time shifts. <br>

way? <br>

in bed, and the whole station was rocked by an explosion. Before I
could get to Ops, the evacuation alarm sounded and the comm. systems
were down. I got as many people as I could in here. I don't know what
happened to the others. When you go back, you have to find out what
happened and stop it. <br>

O'BRIEN: We've got a new problem, sir. <br>
(after the adverts) <br>
SISKO: Did you see anything from the runabout that would indicate how
the station was destroyed? <br>
O'BRIEN: There were a series of explosions that rippled across the
Habitat ring, but it all happened so fast I couldn't get a clear sense
of exactly what was going on. <br>
KIRA: Could you tell if you were looking at internal explosions, which
might indicate some kind of sabotage or accident, or external
explosions which might indicate we were under attack? <br>
O'BRIEN: No. No, I'm not sure. <br>
DAX: Do you remember seeing any other ships nearby? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, but I had a very limited view of the area. <br>
KIRA: At this point we can't rule anything out. <br>
SISKO: Agreed. Make preparations to evacuate the station, but do it
quietly. If the destruction of the station is the result of an attack
or sabotage, we don't want to alarm our enemy and make him trigger
events we're trying to avoid. Begin a complete systems check of
everything on the station that could potentially cause this kind of
explosion. <br>
DAX: Right. <br>
O'BRIEN: Commander, there might be another way to find out what's going
on. If I could travel into the future again, this time just before the
destruction of DS Nine, I might be able to find out what's going to
happen and then return to the present in time for us to prevent it from
happening. If you could flood my body with high concentrations of delta
series radioisotopes, it might trigger a
time shift into the future. <br>
BASHIR: Possibly, but those isotopes are toxic. It could cause
permanent damage to your nervous system. It might even kill you. <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh. Well, if the future happens the way I saw it happen, a lot
of people are going to get killed when the station explodes. It's a
risk I'm willing to take. <br>
SISKO: Even if you're able to initiate a time jump, each time you
travelled into the future, you've always gone five hours. How do you
propose to shorten the length of the jump? <br>
O'BRIEN: There might be a link between the temporal frequency of the
singularity and the length of the
time shift. <br>
BASHIR: We might be able to calibrate the decay constant of the isotope
that we inject you with to match the frequency of the singularity. And
with a few minor adjustments we can control how far you jump into the
future. <br>
O'BRIEN: Exactly. <br>
SISKO: All right. But if you can't do it within two hours, I'm going to
begin to evacuate the station. <br>

BASHIR: Now, when you activate this device it'll inject you with a two
rad dose of delta isotopes. Now, if our calculations are right, that
should put you about three hours into the future. <br>
O'BRIEN: What's the margin of error? <br>
BASHIR: Plus or minus a half hour I'd say, but that's the best we could
do. Now, it's already set for the return trip, so all you have to do is
activate it again to return to the present. <br>
O'BRIEN: Right. <br>

so you had to destroy the station too. That way, there'd be no
