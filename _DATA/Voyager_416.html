<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Janeway,
as a Klingon warrior, is fighting other warriors.)<br>
JANEWAY: P'tahk! Prepare to meet your ancestors! <br>
(But the other warriors keep pushing her back until one manages to
thrust the point of his bat'leth into her chest, knocking her down on
her back.)<br>
JANEWAY: This battle is yours today,
but the House of Mo'kai will never yield. <br>
(She grabs a mace from a fallen Klingon and resumes the fight. She is
interrupted by an Hirogen in Klingon armour.)<br>
KARR: Doh-cha scree! Move away, coward. I want to make this kill. <br>
JANEWAY: You should have killed me when my back was turned. <br>
KARR: I want to see the fear in your eyes. <br>
JANEWAY: Look closely and you'll see your own destruction. <br>
KARR: You are resilient prey. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm no one's prey. <br>
(She raises the mace and he stabs her in the stomach.) <br>
KARR: You are mine, now and after death. Sickbay, this is Holodeck
two. Janeway requires medical assistance. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Voyager
is surrounded by Hirogen vessels. Janeway now looks human on the
biobed. An Hirogen is working in Sickbay.)<br>
MEDIC: She'll survive. <br>
KARR: What about her neural interface? <br>
(The medic scans a Y shaped scar below Janeway's jawline.)<br>
MEDIC: Stable. <br>
KARR: Are you sure? There were times when she seemed aware of who she
is. <br>
MEDIC: Impossible. I was monitoring the crew during the entire
simulation. She believes she's whoever we programme her to be. Shall I
return her
to the Klingon simulation? <br>
KARR: No. Bring her to Holodeck one. I've found another programme I
want to try. A conflict that took place on her own planet. It should
prove stimulating. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(A
French café during World War 2. Mademoiselle de Neuf is singing It
Can't Be Wrong to piano accompaniment.)<br>
SEVEN:
Wrong, would it be wrong to kiss? Seeing I feel like this, would it be
wrong to try? Wrong, would it be wrong to stay, here in your arms this
way, under this starry sky? If it is wrong (Tuvok is the bartender in a
white jacket, and the owner wears a white three piece man's suit à la
Marlene Dietrich as she greets her Nazi and French customers. She moves
amongst the tables.)<br>
JANEWAY: Welcome to Le Coeur de Lion. I'm Katrine. The first round is
with my compliments, on one condition. You leave the war outside. More
escargot for table nine. Jacques, no lady tonight? Oh, we'll have to
see
what we can do about that. <br>
(She sits at a table.)<br>
JANEWAY: Forgive my neglecting you. Now, where were
we? Ah, yes, my latest adventure in Paris. <br>
(She looks over to the bar and sees Tuvok nod towards the entrance. Two
Hirogen Nazi officers are entering.)<br>
JANEWAY: I'm afraid I'll have to neglect
you again. Excuse me. <br>
(She goes to the bar.)<br>
TUVOK: That's him. <br>
JANEWAY: Our new Kommandant? <br>
TUVOK: British intelligence believes he's been sent here to oversee the
occupation of the city. <br>
JANEWAY: What's his history? <br>
TUVOK: He served with Rommel in North Africa and Schmidt in Poland. He
is a formidable military strategist, notorious for his cruelty. <br>
JANEWAY: Ah. Let's make him feel at home. Send him a bottle of Chateau
LaTour. My compliments. <br>
TUVOK: The '29? <br>
JANEWAY: I hate to waste good wine. Give him the '36. <br>
TUVOK: As you wish. <br>
SEVEN:&nbsp;And I have waited so long. It must be right. It can't be
wrong. <br>
(The song finishes, and she gets a round of applause.)<br>
SEVEN: Merci. Be generous to Claude this evening. Without him, my voice
is empty. Good evening. <br>TURANJ: Sing. <br>
SEVEN: Tonight's performance is over. Return tomorrow. <br>
TURANJ: Now. <br>
SEVEN: Remove your hand. <br>
TURANJ: Obey me, or I will hunt you down and your bones
will adorn the bulkhead of my ship. <br>
KARR: Sit down and play the game. In this setting, we have no ships.
We are an ancient race of soldiers intent upon conquering this world.
Play the game. <br>
JANEWAY: Now, now, what's this? Mademoiselle LeNeuf will be happy to
sing another song. Just give her a few minutes to freshen up. <br>
SEVEN: It's late. <br>
JANEWAY: Freshen up. <br>
SEVEN: Very well. <br>
JANEWAY: Kommandant Karr. <br>
KARR: You know me. <br>
JANEWAY: Your reputation precedes you. I'm Katrine. Le Coeur de Lion is
my establishment. The first round is with my compliments, on one
condition. You leave the war outside. <br>
KARR: I wish to speak with her. Alone. <br>
(The nearby French patrons and the SS officer leave them.)<br>
JANEWAY: Charming gentleman. <br>
KARR: He is disoriented. Your world is unfamiliar to him. <br>
JANEWAY: He'll be comfortable soon enough. The arms of France are open
to all. <br>
KARR: I've heard otherwise. <br>
(They sit at a table.)<br>
JANEWAY: What do you mean? <br>
KARR: I understand there is opposition to our presence here among
your citizens. <br>
JANEWAY: The Resistance? In Paris perhaps. But this is a small city,
defenceless. We've learned to be a little more diplomatic. When this
war is over we want to remain on good terms with the victor. <br>
KARR: Whoever that may be. <br>
JANEWAY: Whoever that may be. <br>
(A waiter brings the wine and glasses.)<br>
KARR: Your city may be defenceless, but it's crucial to the war. Any
ground assault into Germany must pass through this province. The
Resistance will come here. <br>
JANEWAY: If they do, I'll tell them what I tell everyone. Leave the war
outside. <br>
(The Hirogen Alpha tries the wine.)<br>
KARR: Excellent. <br>(An Hirogen SS officer comes to the table.)<br>
TURANJ: Kommandant, I've been informed there's a problem in
the Engineering section. The warp plasma network has become unstable. <br>
JANEWAY: What's he talking about? <br>
KARR: It need not concern you. To the hunt. <br>
JANEWAY: The hunt? <br>
KARR: For the Resistance. I shall take great pleasure in tracking them
down and making the kill. <br>
(He kisses her hand and leaves.)<br>
JANEWAY: Au revoir. <br>
(Later, Seven is counting the takings.)<br>
JANEWAY: How'd we do? <br>
SEVEN: Insufficient for a Saturday night. Twelve hundred forty seven
francs and eighty one Reichmarks. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, it should be enough to buy an oscillator to extend the
range of our radio. First thing tomorrow morning I want you to take a
little trip to the countryside. There's a Monsieur Groleau who has a
cottage just past the third bridge. He's got a wine cellar full of
vacuum tubes. Tell him we need a high frequency oscillator. Offer him
three hundred francs but don't go any higher than five hundred. <br>
SEVEN: We have more pressing needs. <br>
JANEWAY: Such as? <br>
SEVEN: Explosives. We need a launcher that can fire armour piercing
grenades. <br>
JANEWAY: Planning on blowing up a German tank? <br>
SEVEN: If necessary. <br>
JANEWAY: We're not trying to build an army here. <br>
SEVEN: Then&nbsp;maybe it's time we did. Three more German battalions have
occupied the city and a Panzer division is holding position eleven
kilometres away. When the Americans arrive and the fighting begins, I
don't intend to be standing next to a piano singing Moonlight Becomes
You. <br>
JANEWAY: The Americans won't even be able to approach this city without
our help. And if they can't liberate Sainte Claire the assault into
Germany could fail. We need to be gathering information about German
troop movements and relaying it to Allied Command. <br>
SEVEN: I'm tired of lighting the Nazi's cigarettes and laughing at
their jokes. We should be helping the Allies by assassinating these
pigs. <br>
JANEWAY: The moment we start shooting we expose ourselves. Right now,
no one suspects us. And I am not about to risk our entire operation
because you've suddenly developed a nervous trigger finger. <br>
SEVEN: That is your opinion, Madame. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm the leader of the movement here and right now my opinion
is the only one that counts, so get the oscillator. I think we're all
feeling the strain. It's been a hard four years. But believe me, the
Third Reich is feeling it too. We just have to hang on a little while
longer. Word from the Americans is going to come any day. <br>
SEVEN: Perhaps. <br>
(Seven leaves.)<br>
TUVOK: Again? <br>
JANEWAY: Again. Why is she so adamant? What she's proposing would put
us all at risk. <br>
TUVOK: Maybe that's her intention. <br>
JANEWAY: If you have suspicions, my old friend, let's hear them. <br>
TUVOK: From the beginning, she's been argumentative, and on more than a
few occasions she's disobeyed your direct orders. <br>
JANEWAY: She's headstrong. Typical of the underground. <br>
TUVOK: Nevertheless, her behaviour has threatened our identities. <br>
JANEWAY: She's the only munitions expert we have, and she can carry a
tune. We need her. Let's keep our eye on her. Have her followed for the
next few days. If she is a Nazi infiltrator, we'll have to eliminate
her. </font></p>

cycles down the road with baguettes and bottles of wine in his
panniers.)<br>
NEELIX:
Bonjour, madame. <br>
WOMAN [OC]: Bonjour.<br>
(Neelix snatches an apple as he passes a stall.)<br>
NEELIX: Put it on my account. Guten Tag. <br>
TURANJ: You! Halt! <br>
(Neelix obeys.)<br>
TURANJ: Get off your vehicle. What are you
transporting? <br>
NEELIX: Nothing but the very essentials of life. <br>
(The Hirogen grabs a baguette and breaks it in two. Then he opens a
bottle and pours the contents out.)<br>
TURANJ: Proceed to your destination. <br>
NEELIX: That I will. That I most certainly will. <br>
TURANJ: If the choice were mine, you would already be dead.

fog across the Channel. Temperatures are expected to range from a low
of forty

(Torres is writing all this down when static breaks it up.)<br>
TORRES: Damn, I'm missing it. <br>
(Meanwhile, Tuvok turns around a painting of a naked lady to look at a
map fastened to the back.)<br>
TUVOK: Our most recent intelligence shows two German divisions here and
here. <br>
JANEWAY: How recent is this intelligence? <br>
TUVOK: Forty eight hours. <br>
JANEWAY: Old news. <br>
RADIO: I'm Reginald Smith and you're listening to the British Radio
Network. This report will repeat in <br>
TORRES: Forty five seconds. <br>
RADIO: Forty five seconds. <br>
TORRES: Here's to English precision. <br>
(Someone knocks on the door. Janeway picks up a handgun.)<br>
JANEWAY: We're closed. <br>
NEELIX [OC]: Morning delivery. <br>
(She lets him in.)<br>
JANEWAY: You're late. What happened? <br>
NEELIX: Oh, just a tête-à-tête with a member of the Master Race. <br>
JANEWAY: That's the second time this week. Sounds like they're
increasing their patrols. <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps it's time we chose another courier. Our baker is
arousing suspicion. <br>
NEELIX: There's no need to worry. I change my route every day, and I've
become quite friendly with most of the Gestapo. They just love my
strudel. (Neelix carefully peels the label from the now empty bottle of
Quart de Chaume.)<br>
RADIO: A kind thank you to Jazzy McNulty and his Band. Now, the weather
for today, September the twenty second, nineteen forty four. In London
skies are grey, with a strong chance of afternoon rain. Temperatures
will range from a low of fifty two degrees to a high of seventy one.
The northern coast reports heavy rain and strong winds,&nbsp;ocean
swells
reaching four feet. Devonshire, Hertfordshire and Summershire all
report rain. It's currently fifty nine degrees in Dover with low fog
across the Channel. Temperatures are expected to range from a low of
forty five degrees to a high of sixty three. I am Reginald Smith and
you are listening <br>
(Torres turns off the radio.)<br>
TORRES: Got it. Let's see the code key. <br>
JANEWAY: Every fifth letter, every third vowel. Use the Sunday
decryption sequence. A, H, C. Straight from Allied High Command. <br>
NEELIX: It must be important. <br>
TUVOK: All messages regarding the war are important. It's only a matter
of degree. <br>
NEELIX: I suppose you're right, but do you have to be so logical about
everything? <br>
TUVOK: In any covert battle, logic is a potent weapon. You might try it
sometime. <br>
JANEWAY: American Fourth Infantry to invade Sainte Claire Tuesday dawn.
<br>
NEELIX: That's two days from now. <br>
JANEWAY: Require assistance. Disable enemy communications. End message.
<br>
TUVOK: The German radio transmitter is housed at their headquarters. <br>
NEELIX: That building is surrounded by guards. We can't just waltz in
there and plant a bomb. <br>
TORRES: Maybe I can help. <br>
JANEWAY: How? <br>
TORRES: I'm upset. I need to see my special friend. Even if it means
bothering him at the office. <br>
TUVOK: A reconnaissance mission. <br>
TORRES: I'll try to locate the radio, see where the guards are posted,
examine the locks. Gather enough information to get us inside. <br>
JANEWAY: It's too dangerous. If you're caught, you'll be tortured for
information. <br>
TORRES: You don't know my friend. He would never do anything to harm
his own child. <br>
