50460.3. We've been investigating an inversion nebula for several days.
This phenomenon has never been seen in the Alpha Quadrant, and is
proving something of a mystery to us here. </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
According to Federation astro-theorists, inversion nebulae are so
unstable they're supposed to burn out within a few years, but this one
appears to be centuries old. <br>
PARIS: Maybe the theorists were wrong. After all, they never had a
chance to look at the real thing. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Not entirely wrong. These plasma strands we're approaching
look ready to ignite. <br>
JANEWAY: Tom, back us off two thousand kilometres. That'll give us a
safety margin. <br>
PARIS: Aye, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Harry, set the sensors for full spectrum scans, continuous
sweep. If that nebula does flare up, I don't want to miss a beat.
Mister Kim, I need your attention on the sensors. <br>
KIM: Sorry, Captain. Full spectrum scans. I'm on it. <br>
JANEWAY: Astro-theory never predicted this would be so lovely. Beauty
and mystery, a tantalising combination. <br>
PARIS: No argument here. Right, Tuvok? <br>
TUVOK: I am fully capable of appreciating this phenomenon without the
extraneous sentimentality humans find so necessary. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Being moved by an emotion isn't always extraneous. Sometimes
it's the whole point. </font></p>

quarters]</b> </font></p>

is carefully inserting short metal rods into a complex globular
construct. The doorbell rings.) <br>
TUVOK: Enter. Mister Kim. Can I help you? <br>
KIM: Er. That's kal-toh, isn't it? Vulcan chess? <br>
TUVOK: Kal-toh is to chess as chess is to tic-tac-toe. <br>
KIM: I should have known. <br>
TUVOK: What is on your mind, Ensign? <br>
KIM: Tuvok, I need your help. I want to eliminate emotions, like
Vulcans do. <br>
TUVOK: Mister Kim, it is a lifelong process. <br>
KIM: I realise that. And I also know that Vulcans use certain
techniques. <br>
TUVOK: The t'san s'at, the intellectual deconstruction of emotional
patterns. <br>
KIM: I'm willing to learn. <br>
TUVOK: May I ask why? <br>
KIM: I have feelings I don't want to have. <br>
TUVOK: That would seem to be self-evident. And what is the nature of
those feelings? <br>
KIM: I'm in love, and I don't want to be. <br>
TUVOK: I see. And who is the object of your affections? <br>
KIM: Her name is Marayna. <br>
TUVOK: I am not aware of anyone on the ship with that name. <br>
KIM: She's not a member of the crew. She's a character on the holodeck.
<br>
TUVOK: You're in love with a computer subroutine? <br>
KIM: That's the problem. <br>
(Tuvok places his final rod, and the construct transforms into an
elegant polygon.) <br>
TUVOK: Interesting. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TUVOK:
To see through an emotional complex is to rob it of its power. The
first step is to identify the complex in which you have been caught. <br>
KIM: I told you. I'm in love. <br>
TUVOK: There are many different kinds of love, Ensign. You must learn
to differentiate. For example, you told me that you met this individual
only days ago. Yet you feel overwhelmed. <br>
KIM: I can't get her out of my mind. Not for a second. <br>
TUVOK: Have you been able to sleep? <br>
KIM: No. <br>
TUVOK: Have you eaten? <br>
KIM: No. <br>
TUVOK: Does your daily routine seem somehow empty, perhaps even
ludicrous? <br>
KIM: Yes! <br>
TUVOK: You are experiencing shon-ha'lock, the engulfment. It is the
most intense and psychologically perilous form of eros. I believe
humans call it love at first sight. <br>
KIM: But we're talking about a holodeck character. <br>
TUVOK: Irrelevant. The emotional complex in which you are trapped is
the same and so is the cure. Logical deconstruction, followed by a
regimen of meditative suppression. As I shall demonstrate. </font></p>

KIM: Neelix. Have you seen Marayna? <br>
NEELIX: Ah, perfect. Welcome, gentlemen. Just getting things ready for
tonight's little get-together. <br>
KIM: I completely forgot. The luau. <br>
NEELIX: Polynesian style. I've done my research. Er, Lieutenant Tuvok,
you neglected to RSVP. <br>
TUVOK: That was not an oversight, I assure you. <br>
KIM: Where's Marayna? <br>
NEELIX: Who? <br>
KIM: She's part of this programme. <br>
NEELIX: Doesn't ring a bell. <br>
KIM: How could you miss her? She's tall, athletic, blonde. <br>
NEELIX: Oh, one of the entertainment directors. I believe she's giving
Kes a hydrosail lesson. <br>
(A crewman is carrying a tiki torch.) <br>
NEELIX: No, no, not there. There. <br>
KES: Harry, Tuvok, the lake is perfect today. <br>
MARAYNA: Hello, Harry. <br>
KIM: Hi, Marayna. <br>
KES: We were just talking about you. <br>
KIM: You were? <br>
KES: Marayna said what an excellent student you are. <br>
KIM: She's a great instructor. <br>
MARAYNA: Ready to get your ears wet? <br>
TUVOK: Vulcans do not hydrosail. <br>
MARAYNA: Oh, why not? <br>
KES: Lieutenant Tuvok prefers the solitude of his own quarters and a
game of kal-toh. <br>
MARAYNA: I'm sure we can do better than that. <br>
KES: I'm going back on duty. Thanks. <br>
MARAYNA: You're welcome. (to Kim) There's a volleyball game starting
down in the sand. <br>
TUVOK: Mister Kim and I would prefer some conversation. Would you care
to join us? <br>
MARAYNA: All right. I tried a reverse curl this morning. I think I
pulled a tendon. Feel that. <br>
(She puts Kim's hand on her right calf.) <br>
KIM: It's like a knot. <br>
TUVOK: I'm sure it is. <br>
MARAYNA: Are you two friends? <br>
KIM: Yes. <br>
TUVOK: No. We're colleagues. I respect Mister Kim for his intelligence
and his integrity. And I assume he holds me in the same regard. <br>
MARAYNA: So Vulcans don't hydrosail, and they don't have friends? <br>
TUVOK: We have fellowships and associations, but without the emotional
dimension humans experience. <br>
MARAYNA: Hmm. (to Kim) You and I are friends, aren't we? <br>
KIM: Er, yeah. <br>
MARAYNA: Good. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Chakotay to Tuvok and Kim. Report to the bridge. <br>
TUVOK: Acknowledged. We're on our way. <br>
MARAYNA: There's a luau tonight. You're coming, aren't you? Both of
you? <br>
TUVOK: No. <br>
KIM: Yes. <br>
MARAYNA: You've got to stop doing that. <br>
TUVOK: Ensign? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TUVOK:
As I predicted, your responses were as formulaic as a mathematical
equation. <br>
KIM: What do you mean? <br>
TUVOK: Consider the expression on your face when Neelix did not recall
Marayna. Annoyance. <br>
KIM: That's not true. <br>
TUVOK: It is quite true. At that moment, Neelix was functioning in
Vulcan terms as the soo-lak, the third party who, by his very lack of
interest, trivialises your own. <br>
KIM: I guess it really did bother me. <br>
TUVOK: And the arrival of Kes with Marayna then precipitated in you the
k'oh-nar, the feeling of being completely exposed. <br>
KIM: I was embarrassed, and I was sure Kes would take one look at my
face and know exactly what I was feeling. <br>
TUVOK: And when Marayna placed your hand on her stressed tendon. <br>
KIM: Let's not even talk about that. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Turbolift]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TUVOK:
Bridge. <br>
KIM: It's all so predictable. <br>
TUVOK: That's just what I've been trying to get you to perceive. To the
trained Vulcan intellect, intense romantic love is nothing more than a
set of stereotypical behaviours. Not having our discipline, typically,
humans are swept along by the process until it ends. <br>
KIM: How does it end? <br>
TUVOK: Either in conversion to a more balanced, stable relationship, or
in tragic circumstances. <br>
KIM: I can't have a balanced, stable relationship with a holodeck
character. Marayna's a computer programme. She could never feel for me
what I feel for her. <br>
TUVOK: Exactly. Logic dictates a single course of action. Retreat. <br>
KIM: To tell you the truth, I don't even like hydrosailing. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CHAKOTAY:
The temperature's five thousand degrees kelvin and rising. <br>
TUVOK: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: We've located a plasma strand that looks like it's seconds
from igniting. <br>
CHAKOTAY: There is some kind of unknown process that's been keeping
this nebula from going up like a torch. We're going to see it in
action. <br>
TUVOK: And if there isn't? <br>
PARIS: I've got my hand on the controls. We'll be out of here before it
even touches our shields. <br>
KIM: Captain, the temperature is nine thousand degrees kelvin. I'm
picking up a subatomic cascade reaction. <br>
PARIS: There she goes. <br>
(The strand flares, then vanishes in a big flash.) <br>
KIM: The plasma strand completely burned itself out. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Without causing a chain reaction in the nebula. <br>
JANEWAY: Harry, what put out the flames? <br>
KIM: Sensors show some kind of dampening effect between the strands,
but I can't isolate it. <br>
JANEWAY: Like a firebreak in space. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If we understood how this happened, we might be able to find
a new way to contain a warp core breach. <br>
JANEWAY: Or any plasma reaction. It's an investigation worth pursuing.
Tom, it seems safe enough. Take us in for short range sensor scans.
Let's find out all we can about this phenomenon. <br>
PARIS: Aye, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll see all of you at Mister Neelix's luau. I'm sure everyone
will be attending. <br>

PARIS: Lieutenant, you look absolutely <br>
TORRES: Tropical? <br>
PARIS: More along the lines of smashing. <br>
TORRES: Thanks. <br>
PARIS: Of course, nothing can quite measure up with this shirt. This is
an exact recreation of a 1962 Big Daddy-O Surf Special, an American
classic. <br>
TORRES: I'd say you put just a little bit too much thought into that. <br>
PARIS: Now that's where you're wrong. <br>
TORRES: Let's go. I told Vorik we'd pick him up at sixteen hundred
hours, and you know how Vulcan he gets when anybody is late. <br>
PARIS: Vorik? I thought we were meeting Harry. <br>
TORRES: Oh, he's not coming. <br>

PARIS: Harry, this is a luau. You look like you're dressed for a
funeral. What are you doing? <br>
KIM: A Vulcan meditation. <br>
PARIS: What for? <br>
KIM: To suppress my emotions. <br>
PARIS: Is something wrong? <br>
KIM: Not really. <br>
PARIS: The resort woman? What was her name? <br>
KIM: Marayna. How did you know that? <br>
PARIS: Well, for two days now, every time I look for you it's always,
he's in Holodeck one. And since you don't like hydrosailing, I figured
something was going on. <br>
KIM: Am I that predictable? You sound like Tuvok. <br>
PARIS: Tuvok? He told you to do all this? <br>
KIM: Logically, the best course is retreat. Meditation helps. <br>
PARIS: Retreat? A classic case of Vulcan denial, if you ask me. Come
on, Harry. We have all fallen for a holodeck character. It happens. You
deal with it by staying with your normal routine, not by hiding out in
your quarters. <br>
KIM: I'm not hiding out. I'm deconstructing the emotional complex. <br>
PARIS: Okay. Have fun. <br>

NEELIX: I've done a great deal of ethnographic research on the
Polynesian cultures on Earth. The flowered garland, or lei, is said to
represent the flowering of love. It's a marvellous tradition, don't you
think? <br>

(Janeway is with Chakotay. She receives a lei.) <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, thank you. Tuvok, I'm glad to see you here. <br>
TUVOK: I would never disobey an order, Captain, no matter how
burdensome. <br>
JANEWAY: There's a difference between an order and a suggestion. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The evening's young, Lieutenant. Let's mingle. <br>
TUVOK: Vulcans do not. Curious. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What's that? <br>
TUVOK: If you will excuse me. <br>
(Tuvok goes over to Marayna, who is at a table playing kal-toh.) <br>
TUVOK: A common error among novice players. By placing the t'an on
opposite sides of the kal-toh, you are attempting to introduce a
spatial balance, a strategy that will most certainly fail. <br>
MARAYNA: Why? <br>
TUVOK: Kal-toh is not about striving for balance. It is about finding
the seeds of order, even in the midst of profound chaos. May I? <br>
MARAYNA: Please. <br>
(Tuvok places a piece, and part of the structure transforms.) <br>
MARAYNA: How beautiful. <br>
TUVOK: Kal-toh is not about beauty. <br>
MARAYNA: I understand, but it's still beautiful. Did you learn to play
on Vulcan? <br>
TUVOK: Yes. From the age of five, I took lessons from a master. <br>
MARAYNA: I thought you might enjoy having an opponent. Playing alone
must get a little predictable sometimes. <br>
TUVOK: You are perceptive. <br>
MARAYNA: Yes, I am. Extremely so. <br>
GIRL: Aloha, miss. <br>
(She gives Marayna a lei.) <br>
GIRL: Sir? <br>
TUVOK: No, thank you. <br>
MARAYNA: You're the only one here not wearing a garland. <br>
TUVOK: Given the decor, it seems somehow excessive. <br>
MARAYNA: I don't believe you. <br>
TUVOK: I beg your pardon. <br>
MARAYNA: I think you're tying to isolate yourself and make a public
protest at the same time. <br>
TUVOK: Explain. <br>
MARAYNA: You didn't want to be here in the first place. Being the only
one without a lei sets you apart from the others, allowing you to
symbolically maintain your solitude. And since everybody can see that
you're the only one without a lei, you're letting them know that you'd
rather be somewhere else. <br>
TUVOK: Your logic is impeccable. <br>
(Marayna takes off her lei and gazes into Tuvok's eyes. Elsewhere,
Paris takes two pineapples from a tray.) <br>
PARIS: Thanks. <br>
(They contain drinks.) <br>
TORRES: Thanks. I am starving. <br>
PARIS: Oh, me too. Let's find us a spot. This place is filling up fast.
<br>
VORIK: I have already taken the liberty of reserving a table,
Lieutenant, with a view of the lakeside. You did express a fondness for
that particular vista. <br>
TORRES: I did? <br>
VORIK: Five days ago in a conversation we had in Engineering regarding
holodeck programmes. <br>
TORRES: I guess maybe I did. <br>
PARIS: Good memory. <br>
VORIK: Of course. <br>
TORRES: Well, then, Ensign, let's go. <br>
(Torres and Vorik leave. Paris goes off to find his best friend looking
around for someone. Kim spots Marayna with Tuvok.) <br>
PARIS: Harry? <br>
KIM: What? <br>
PARIS: Do you want to get something to eat or not? <br>
KIM: I don't know. Maybe this isn't a good idea. Listen, I'm going back
to my quarters. <br>
PARIS: Harry.<br>
KIM: Tom! <br>
PARIS: Okay. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. <br>
(Kim leaves. The evening draws on. Almost everyone has left the
holodeck.) <br>
MARAYNA: I like the excitement of the water, the danger of being tossed
around by the wind and the waves. But at the same time, feeling like
I'm in control. <br>
TUVOK: The illusion of control. <br>
MARAYNA: That's exactly right, because no one can control the wind and
the waves. But for a few moments when you're on the water, and the ride
is perfect, the feeling is that you can. You ever feel that? <br>
TUVOK: No. <br>
MARAYNA: Never? Don't you have an imagination? <br>
TUVOK: If by imagination, you mean the ability to spontaneously
generate images within my mind, then, yes, I have a highly developed
imagination, as do all of my race. <br>
MARAYNA: All right, imagine this, that you with your logic and your
reason, are skimming atop endless waves of emotion. You believe you're
in control, but you know that control is an illusion. You believe that
you understand the depths beneath you, but that, too, is an illusion. <br>
TUVOK: I can see why Ensign Kim finds you compelling. <br>
MARAYNA: I can see why Harry admires and respects you, because it's
obvious that he does. And so do I. <br>
TUVOK: I must return to my quarters. <br>
MARAYNA: Please stay. I've never met anyone like you. <br>
TUVOK: I must admit, I share that conclusion. You are a unique
individual. <br>
MARAYNA: Then stay. <br>
TUVOK: It is late. I must go. <br>
MARAYNA: Then come back tomorrow. I'm sure the weather will hold. <br>
TUVOK: No doubt. <br>

produce one artificially using the deflector dish? Harry, do we have
the data? <br>

process on the computer, and then try to recreate it with the deflector

(Marayna vanishes.) <br>
KIM: That's not going to help. I never should have come to you in the
first place. I should have worked it out myself. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Let's try it again, Mister Paris. Warp six. <br>
PARIS: Course laid in. <br>
JANEWAY: Engage. It would appear to me that we're not moving, Mister
Paris. <br>
PARIS: I don't understand it, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Any ideas, B'Elanna? <br>
TORRES: Warp drive is still on line, and helm control appears to be
working, but the engines aren't responding. It's possible we've got a
computer malfunction, but I can't seem to localise it. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's run a level four computer diagnostic. All systems. <br>
KIM: Aye, Captain. <br>
TORRES: Captain, I just got aft thrusters to respond. It's not much. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll take it, B'Elanna. Tom, let's go. <br>
CHAKOTAY: At this speed, we'll be completely clear of the nebula by
tomorrow. <br>

Your move. <br>
(Marayna is wearing a Starfleet uniform and mobile emitter.) <br>
MARAYNA: I think you'll find my game has improved. <br>
TUVOK: How did you get here? <br>
MARAYNA: Simple. I transferred myself from the holodeck to the sickbay,
then used your physician's mobile emitter. <br>
TUVOK: I deleted you from the holodeck. <br>
MARAYNA: But you only did that for Harry's benefit. I know you wanted
to keep seeing me. I like Harry, but you're different. You're not like
anyone else. <br>
TUVOK: Why have you come here to my quarters? <br>
MARAYNA: You're like a new world to me, Tuvok. I want to know
everything about you. I didn't realise how lonely my existence was, and
I can't go back to the way things were, not without you. <br>
TUVOK: Tuvok to bridge. Intruder alert. Security team to my quarters. <br>
MARAYNA: No! Why did you do that? Don't you want us to be together? <br>
TUVOK: Given your actions, I have no choice but to consider you a
potential threat to myself and to Voyager. <br>
MARAYNA: But you're wrong. I would never do anything to harm you. Make
it stop! <br>
(The alarm stops.) <br>
TUVOK: You have access to the ship's control systems? <br>
MARAYNA: And I'll use them all if I have to. You can't just delete me! <br>
(Two security guards enter, and she vanishes. The mobile emitter drops
to the deck.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Briefing
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Where is this individual now? <br>
TORRES: When security got to Tuvok's quarters, she downloaded herself
back into the computer and onto the holodeck. <br>
PARIS: More to the point, what is she? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Most likely a sentient computer programme. I checked the
Starfleet database. This kind of thing has happened before. The
Enterprise-D under Picard was once taken over by a holocharacter. <br>
(That would be <a href="../NextGen/129.htm" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Moriarty</a>.) <br>
KIM: We studied that case at the Academy. It gained control of the ship
from inside the holodeck. <br>
TUVOK: Marayna may well have done the same. She was able to silence the
intruder alert by an apparent act of will. <br>
JANEWAY: Does that mean she has the run of our entire computer system? <br>
TUVOK: She may. <br>
JANEWAY: Is it possible that she's the source of our mysterious
malfunctions? <br>
TORRES: It's certainly possible. If Marayna's able to manipulate the
ship's computer pathways, she could have disrupted propulsion and then
covered her tracks so we couldn't trace the cause. <br>
JANEWAY: But why? What's her motivation? <br>
TUVOK: I believe it has something to do with her feelings toward me. In
my quarters, she made reference to her loneliness and expressed her
desire to continue our relationship. <br>
PARIS: But what does that have to do with knocking propulsion offline? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Could she be trying to keep us near the nebula? <br>
KIM: This all started the day we got here. That's when I first met her.
Maybe the nebula is somehow affecting the holodeck. <br>
JANEWAY: Giving rise to an intelligence that doesn't belong there. <br>
TORRES: It's possible. <br>
JANEWAY: In any case, I can't allow her to gain any further control
over my ship. Tuvok, Paris, Torres, get down to holodeck one. (to
Tuvok) I want this situation resolved one way or another. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Outside

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TORRES:
She's locked us out of the programme. We'll be lucky if we can open the
doors. <br>
(The doors open.) <br>
PARIS: We're lucky. <br>
TUVOK: Marayna may have opened the doors. Caution is advised. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The

TORRES: I'll try to access the inside control panel. <br>
PARIS: It's kind of creepy. <br>
TUVOK: Marayna's attempting to recreate the setting of my previous
encounter with her. <br>
PARIS: Ah. You really know how to pick 'em, Tuvok. <br>
TORRES: I got access to the holodeck computer. <br>
PARIS: I'm not reading anything unusual on the holodeck. It seems to be
working perfectly. <br>
TORRES: There's a subspace signal coming from outside of Voyager. It's
some kind of an uplink. There's somebody on a ship out there, tapping
into the <br>

PARIS: B'Elanna! <br>
(A pair of big Polynesians fight Tuvok while a girl knocks down Paris.
Tuvok wins, then encounters a forcefield.) <br>
TUVOK: Shoot the control panel. <br>

JANEWAY: Shield status. <br>
KIM: Still holding, Captain, but the inertial dampeners are offline. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Starboard shields are down to eighty percent. <br>
JANEWAY: What happened down there? <br>
TUVOK: Marayna attacked us and attempted to restrain me. She has
control over the holodeck characters. <br>
JANEWAY: But she's not actually on the holodeck. I found an uplink and
tracked it to the nebula. She's on a hidden ship or a space station.
She's manipulating the holodeck from there. <br>
CHAKOTAY: She's been using the Marayna character like a puppet. <br>
JANEWAY: As an interface, a way to move around Voyager to interact with
us. <br>
MARAYNA [OC]: Tuvok, come back to me. I'm waiting for you. <br>
JANEWAY: Harry, try to trace the uplink. Find her. <br>
MARAYNA [OC]: Don't make this more difficult than it already is,
Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Are you responsible for the plasma fires? <br>
MARAYNA [OC]: You're giving me no other choice but to force the issue. <br>
JANEWAY: What do you want? <br>
MARAYNA [OC]: Tuvok. I want Tuvok. Let him come to the holodeck alone,
or I'll destroy your ship. </font></p>

MARAYNA: We're alone now. No one can see us or hear us. We can do
whatever we want. You don't have to pretend anymore. This is our world.

MARAYNA: I won't. <br>
TUVOK: I suggest you reconsider, or Captain Janeway will be forced to

TUVOK: You are using the nebula as a weapon. <br>
MARAYNA: My nebula. <br>
TUVOK: I will fire if necessary. <br>
MARAYNA: You're too late. I've already set the ignition sequence. Only
I can stop it. <br>
TUVOK: Are you alone here, on this station in this nebula? <br>
MARAYNA: Yes. It's my work. <br>
TUVOK: I don't understand. <br>
MARAYNA: I keep the plasma fires from chain-reacting. <br>
TUVOK: You are responsible for the dampening field we've been
investigating. <br>
MARAYNA: That's correct. I generate it from here to preserve the nebula
so that others from my home planet may enjoy its beauty. I watch the
ships when they pass by. They don't even know I'm here. <br>
TUVOK: You are lonely. <br>
MARAYNA: By choice. I prefer to be here, alone. <br>
TUVOK: But you uplinked with our holodeck and created a character in
order to interact with us. <br>
MARAYNA: To amuse myself. I have done it before. Tapped into the
computer of a passing alien vessel, examined all the little details of
their lives. But I never expected to find something as diverting as
your holodeck. I never expected to find you. You are like nothing else
I've ever encountered. And I can't be without you. Stay here with me,
and I will let your ship resume course. <br>
TUVOK: If it is the only option, I would willingly sacrifice myself to
save my crewmates. <br>
MARAYNA: No! That's not enough. You have to want to be with me. <br>
TUVOK: If you truly understood who and what I am, you would know that I
could never return your affections. <br>
MARAYNA: But you are more like me than you are like them. I've seen the
way you isolate yourself. Even in a crowd of people, you're alone. We
should be together. <br>
TUVOK: I must admit, I have found our conversations stimulating. Your
insight and intelligence, fresh and unexpected. In other circumstances,
I would be willing to spend time in your company, to continue to share
knowledge and ideas. But I have a home and a spouse on Vulcan. I have a
mission, and colleagues who depend on me. I do not have a complete
understanding of emotions, but I believe that if you truly care for me,
you will not pursue this course of action. <br>

deeper need. A more profound loneliness than you are willing to admit.
Why don't you call for a replacement? Let another occupy this task.
Attempt for a time to live among your own kind. <br>
