left their dirty plate in the replicator? Tom? <br>
PARIS: It wasn't me. <br>
KIM: It's a biohazard. <br>
PARIS: Take it easy. We'll decontaminate you when we get back home. <br>
KIM: If I ever volunteer for a two week away mission again, would
somebody please confine me to Sickbay? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Too much togetherness for you, Harry? <br>
KIM: Nothing personal, Commander. <br>
NEELIX: To tell you the truth, I've enjoyed our little junket together.
It's given the four of us a chance to bond.<br>
KIM: The bonding stopped when the sonic shower went offline. <br>
NEELIX: That's all part of the experience, the adventure. Think of the
great explorers that came before us. They survived without creature
comforts. <br>
KIM: I wouldn't want to bunk with them, either. <br>
PARIS: Now there's a sight for sore eyes. <br>(Voyager is ahead.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Delta Flyer to Voyager. We're on our approach. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: We've kept a candle burning in the window for you.<br>
PARIS: Forget the candles, break out the champagne. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: I take it the mission was a success? <br>
PARIS: Fifteen planets scanned in fourteen days. We've got a cargo hold
overflowing with dilithium ore. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: That's the kind of news I like to hear. </font></p>

explorers return. <br>(Paris gets a kiss from Torres.)<br>
TORRES: Welcome home. <br>
PARIS: I should go away more often. <br>
KIM: I'm not going away for a long, long time. <br>
TORRES: Homesick, Harry?<br>
KIM: Let's just say I'm looking forward to a hot shower and a
comfortable bed. <br>
EMH: Don't forget to stop by Sickbay for your check-up. <br>
PARIS: Check-up? For what? <br>
EMH: Away team protocol. Crew members are required to submit to a
physical if the mission lasts more than two weeks. Now, who's first? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'll let you know in the morning, Doctor. <br>(They all head off down different corridors.)<br>
EMH: Why put off till tomorrow what you can do today? Commander? Mister
Paris? <br>(Further on.)<br>TORRES:
I've been working on a little surprise for you. <br>
PARIS: Oh? Naughty, or nice? <br>

Come on. So what do you think? <br>
PARIS: Oh! A television set. <br>
TORRES: Circa 1956. I replicated the components, but I assembled it
myself. This is the remote control. You select what you want to watch
by pressing this button. <br>(A simple remote with just four buttons.)<br>
PARIS: A slight problem. There were no remote controls in the 1950's. <br>
TORRES: I took a little poetic license. <br>
PARIS: Cartoon! <br>
TORRES: I found them in the ship's database. <br>(He changes channels.)<br>TV: Vacuum Action! Mop, mop, don't stop<br>PARIS: What's that? <br>
TORRES: That is called a jingle. According to the research I did,
they inserted them into the entertainment programs. I know, it's
confusing, but I kept them in for authenticity. I even replicated
popcorn. <br>
PARIS: Everything is perfect except for one tiny detail. <br>
TORRES: What? <br>
PARIS: You forgot the beer. <br>
TORRES: I can fix that. <br>(Paris switches back to the old cartoon, Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur.)<br>TORRES: You didn't miss much while you were away. The
Doctor gave a lecture on insects indigenous to the Delta Quadrant. <br>
PARIS: Ah ha. <br>
TORRES: It was pretty boring, until Ensign Farley started snoring and
then no one could keep a straight face. Of course, the Doctor wasn't at
all amused. <br>
PARIS: Ooo! Hockey!<br>
TORRES: It was a shame that we had to cut the lecture short, but the
warp core overloaded and then the Borg invaded and we were all
assimilated. <br>
PARIS: Mmm hmm. <br>
TORRES: You haven't heard a single thing I've said, have you? <br>
PARIS: Oh! Look at that!<br>
TORRES: Maybe this was a bad idea. <br>(Later, Paris is on to The Untouchables. Torres has fallen asleep on the couch.)<br>TV: This is Eliot Ness. Come out, we don't want any trouble! <br>(During a gun fight, the picture
changes to a different set of people under fire.) <br>TV: We're under attack. Stay down. Keep moving. Somebody cover me. <br>(Paris
tries changing channels, but the show remains the same. He goes for the
final resort, manual controls, before hitting the set. Then he sees
that one of the combatants is himself.)<br>TV: We need a medic
over here.&nbsp;Stay down. Move it. Stay low. </font></p>

PARIS: I was, I was in the middle of a battlefield. I was grazed right,
right here. They always said television was a bad influence. <br>
TORRES: How about a nice cartoon? That should chase away the nightmare.<br>
PARIS: No! No, I think I've had enough. <br>(In
a Jefferies tube, Kim hears sounds of battle. The hatch recedes from
him, and he feels dizzy. He drops the instrument he is holding and
crawls on his elbows towards the hatch. Panting, he opens it and gets
out into a larger junction.) </font></p>

sounds like you had an anxiety attack. <br>
KIM: I've never been claustrophobic before. <br>
EMH: There's a first time for everything. <br>
KIM: Do you know what could have caused it? <br>
EMH: Let's see. You spend two weeks on an away mission, working
eighteen hour days, then as soon as you return to Voyager you become
Ensign Eager, back on duty and raring to go. <br>
KIM: I had work to do. There was a plasma leak on deck five. <br>
EMH: Plasma leak or no plasma leak, you're suffering from exhaustion.
I'm recommending you take the next two days off. <br>

NAOMI: Did you have a good trip? <br>
NEELIX: Wonderful, thank you.<br>
NAOMI: You look tired.<br>
NEELIX: Do I? Just a little shuttle lag. Don't you have a geometry
lesson? You don't want to keep your teacher waiting.<br>
NAOMI: Seven of Nine assigned me a special project. I'm supposed to
build a tetragon but I have to use everyday things. I'm not allowed to
use a replicator. I was thinking about using some vegetables from the
airponics bay. Carrots and celery? Neelix? <br>
NEELIX: Carrots and celery. A good idea. <br>
NAOMI: Will you help me? <br>
NEELIX: I don't think I'll have time today. <br>
NAOMI: Tonight? <br>
NEELIX: I don't think that I'll have time then either. Lot of work to
do. <br>

YOUNG SOLDIER: I think he's at base. <br>SOLDIER [OC]: Let's move out. <br>

CHAKOTAY: Neelix, this is Commander Chakotay. Let Naomi go. No one's
going to hurt her. That's an order. <br>

gave him a mild sedative. <br>
JANEWAY: Any idea what caused the delusions? <br>
EMH: His norepinephrine levels are three times what they should be.
Neurochemically speaking, he's suffering from a form of post-traumatic
stress syndrome. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I dreamed I was fighting in an alien war. The same war Neelix
seemed to be reliving. <br>
EMH: Harry Kim was in earlier. He had an anxiety attack. I haven't
spoken with Mister Paris yet. <br>
JANEWAY: Three members of the same away team. Did you run into any kind
of trouble while you were gone? <br>
CHAKOTAY: None. The mission was by the book. <br>
EMH: Your engramatic activities contradict that, Commander. These are
real memories, not mere dreams or hallucinations. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe you were abducted, manipulated into fighting. Our
memories have been tampered with before. We're going to retrace your
mission. Start reviewing the Delta Flyer's sensor logs. See if you come
up with anything unusual. How long before Neelix is back on his feet? <br>
EMH: I can wake him now, if you'd like. <rb>

in the middle of a battle. I have no idea how I got there. I can't
remember. <br>

People were screaming. I got so frightened. <br>
JANEWAY: Of what? <br>
KIM: I, I don't know. <br>
PARIS: I remember getting shot. <br>
EMH: There's no evidence of a wound. <br>

been masked as well. <br>
JANEWAY: Do any of you recall who you were fighting? <br>
NEELIX: It was dark. I couldn't see them very well.<br>
PARIS: They were firing at us.<br>
NEELIX: The Nakaa. The Nakana. <br>
KIM: The Nakan. They were called the Nakan. <br>
PARIS: Right. Right. They, they lived in a remote colony. We were
trying to evacuate them. <br>
NEELIX: But they were fighting us. <br>
KIM: Why couldn't they just do what they were told? <br>
NEELIX: We had no right to be there! <br>
KIM: It was for their own good. <br>
JANEWAY: Gentlemen, stay focused. You said you were trying to evacuate
their colony. Why? <br>
PARIS: Those were our orders. <br>
EMH: Who gave them? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Saavdra. <br>
PARIS: Commander Saavdra. <br>
KIM: He was in charge of our unit. We were part of an attack force. <br>
JANEWAY: You were coerced. <br>
PARIS: No. No, I volunteered. We all did.<br>
EMH: I find that difficult to believe. You were obviously manipulated
somehow. <br>
NEELIX: No. No, no, no, no, I remember now. We held a briefing to plan
the evacuation. You were there, Commander. Mister Paris. <br>
PARIS: It was a command post.&nbsp;<br>

What do our spotters report? <br>
KIM: The Nakan are unarmed. They won't put up a fight. <br>
SAAVDRA: Once we've disabled their shield generators, we'll deploy units
five and six. They may be unarmed, but they won't be happy to see us.
Don't provoke them. I want to come out of this with zero casualties on
both sides. <br>
SOLDIER ONE: Understood. <br>
PARIS: The perimeter's the weakest in sector fourteen. The terrain's
very flat. <br>
NEELIX: It's an ideal landing spot for transports. <br>
SAAVDRA: Once we've secured the village, take the colonists there. Get
them aboard. Do your best to reassure them. Make them understand that
this is a temporary relocation. That they're going to be back there in
a few weeks. Understood? <br>
NEELIX: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
SAAVDRA: Problem? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Just one. This unit could use a little sleep. I suggest we
wait until daybreak. <br>
SAAVDRA: I promised Command we'd have this colony secured today. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It can wait a few hours. <br>
SAAVDRA: I'm sorry. But when this mission's over, how does a week on
Toranius Prime sound? <br>

give us a little more trouble. <br>

last enclosure? It was empty. Where were they? They were supposed to be
there. <br>

conflict, but these people weren't anywhere near this system. <br>
TUVOK: We've analysed Voyager's sensor records. If we did participate
in a war, all evidence of it has been erased. <br>
JANEWAY: The dream was so vivid. As real as anything I've experienced.
But I refuse to believe that we could <br>
EMH: Real or not, the memories are having a deleterious effect on the
crew. The syndrome began to spread once we entered this system. I
suggest we reverse course before it gets worse. <br>
JANEWAY: No. If this massacre really happened, someone is to blame. I
want to be certain that it wasn't us. <br>
TUVOK: With all due respect, your judgment may be clouded by feelings
of guilt about an incident that never occurred. The danger to our crew
here and now is indisputable. <br>
JANEWAY: I've seen you looking better, Ensign. <br>
ENSIGN: Yes, ma'am. <br>
JANEWAY: I've felt better myself. But were going to get through this.
The massacre took place on Tarakis. Go to Red alert and set a course.<br>
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. <br>
EMH: A neural suppressant. It will help keep the memories from
resurfacing. <br>(Seven brings food to Neelix.)<br>SEVEN:
Your favourites. Talaxian stew and terra nut soufflé. The soufflé has
collapsed slightly, but its nutritional content is intact. <br>
NEELIX: Thank you. It looks delicious.<br>
SEVEN: When Naomi Wildman is sad, she consumes desserts. She claims it
improves her emotional state. Perhaps you should try it. <br>
NEELIX: Naomi must be terrified of me, after what happened in the
galley. <br>
SEVEN: She's concerned about you. She told me she wants to visit you. <br>
NEELIX: No. Not like this. I might do something to scare her again. <br>
SEVEN: I'll give her your regards.<br>
NEELIX: Seven? When you were a Borg, you were involved in some
unpleasant activities. <br>
SEVEN: I helped to assimilate millions. <br>
NEELIX: I don't mean to be insensitive, but do you ever feel shame
about what you did? <br>
SEVEN: Frequently. <br>
NEELIX: How to you manage to keep going, knowing that you've done such
horrible things? <br>
SEVEN: I have no choice. <br>
NEELIX: Guilt is irrelevant? <br>
SEVEN: On the contrary. My feelings of remorse help me remember what I
did, and prevent me from taking similar actions in the future. Guilt
can be a difficult, but useful, emotion.<br>
NEELIX: It's certainly difficult. Is that chocolate mixed in there with
the terra nuts? <br>
SEVEN: I altered the recipe slightly. I hope you don't object. <br>
NEELIX: Not at all. </font></p>

Tarakis, dead ahead. <br>
JANEWAY: Shields. Stand by weapons. On screen. Scan for vessels. <br>
TUVOK: There are none. <br>
JANEWAY: Take us into orbit. <br>
PARIS: Ma'am? <br>
JANEWAY: Do it, Mister Paris. <br>(He does.)<br>CHAKOTAY:
Life signs? <br>
TUVOK: The planet appears to be uninhabited. <br>
KIM: Looks the same as it did a few days ago when we scanned for
dilithium deposits. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Signs of weapons fire or phaser residue? <br>
TUVOK: Negative. <br>
JANEWAY: Run a full spectral scan. Look for anything unusual. <br>
TUVOK: Nothing on geometric sensors. <br>
KIM: Hold on. I'm picking up a power signature. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Source? <br>
KIM: I can't tell. The signal's erratic, but it's coming from the
northernmost continent. Coordinates one seven two mark five. </font></p>

Call it an educated guess, but I don't think this looks like a war
zone. <br>
JANEWAY: There's something familiar about it, though. I recognise those
mountains. <br>
KIM: Those trees weren't here. <br>
JANEWAY: Search the area. <br>(They split up into two groups. A bird call makes Chakotay jump.)<br>TUVOK:
Ensign? <br>
KIM: The tunnel. It's nearby. The one where I, er <br>
PARIS: How'd you get into it? <br>
KIM: There was a rock formation. It hid the opening.<br>JANEWAY:
A faint energy signature. This way.<br>KIM:
Over here. <br>
PARIS: There's your physical evidence. <br>
TUVOK: I suggest we proceed with caution. Stand guard. <br>(Tuvok leaves Paris with a security guard. Janeway and Chakotay continue to track the energy source.) </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
The structure contains a synaptic transmitter. I believe it was
designed to send neurogenic pulses throughout this system. <br>
JANEWAY: So anyone passing through would experience the Nakan massacre,
like we did. <br>
SEVEN: Precisely. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Try running those symbols inscribed on the base through the
translation
matrix. (reads) Words alone cannot convey the suffering. Words alone
cannot prevent what happened here from happening again. Beyond words
lies experience. Beyond experience lies truth. Make this truth your
own. <br>
JANEWAY: It's a memorial. We weren't victims of a conspiracy, we were
witnesses to a massacre. <br>
CHAKOTAY: More than witnesses. By being forced to relive those events,
half the crew's been traumatised. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe that was the point. I certainly won't forget what
happened here. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Anything in that database that might tell us who built this
thing? <br>
SEVEN: No. The technology has been neglected for more than two
centuries. Its power cells are deteriorating. <br>
JANEWAY: That could explain why our memories were so fragmented. It was
probably designed to transmit the experience in sequence. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Fascinating. Now let's try to shut it down so nobody else has
to go through this. Kathryn? <br>
JANEWAY: Yes, of course. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Briefing
room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH:
Even if we do shut down the transmitter, I'm afraid your memories of the
massacre are permanent. <br>
TUVOK: But we'll prevent this from happening to other passing ships. <br>
NEELIX: If we do that, all record of what happened here would be lost. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The monument will still be here. <br>
NEELIX: But that doesn't really tell the story. Someone put a lot of
time and care into building that transmitter. We can't just deactivate
it. We don't have the right. <br>
KIM: Did they have the right to force us to relive all that?<br>
NEELIX: They wanted others to know what it was like, in the hopes that
nothing like it would happen again. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Why should anyone have to experience an atrocity they didn't
commit? <br>
NEELIX: Because that's how you learn not to make the same mistake. If
we destroy the evidence, we're no better than Saavdra. <br>
PARIS: Maybe he had a point. <br>
KIM: It wasn't our fault! <br>
TUVOK: Given the danger involved, it's only logical <br>
NEELIX: This isn't about logic. It's about remembering. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Some things are best forgotten. <br>
JANEWAY: Not this. I stood by once before and did nothing. Not again. <br>
EMH: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: I watched while Saavdra vaporised the bodies. <br>
PARIS: No offence but, those were other peoples' memories. <br>
JANEWAY: The obelisk at Khitomer. The fields of Gettysburg. Those are
other peoples' memories too, but we don't honour them any less. The
eighty two colonists who died here, they deserve their memorial. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: We're not going to shut down the transmitter. Is that clear?
Is that clear?<br>
TUVOK: Are you suggesting we leave it intact? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm suggesting that we repair it. Recharge the power cells. I
want that monument to function properly for another three hundred
years. We'll place a warning buoy in orbit. Anyone who enters this
system will know what to expect. Dismissed. </font></p>

stopped at this planet all the people who died here would have been
forgotten. And if they could, I know they'd thank you. Janeway to
Voyager. Stand by to initiate power transfer. Five to beam up. </font>
