Captain's log, stardate 51145.3. The Defiant has been operating out of
Starbase three seven five, conducting forays into Dominion controlled
space. While the missions have taken a toll on my people, they remain
determined to do whatever it takes to win this war, as do I. </font>

NOG: Here you are. <br>
SISKO: Where did you get your hands on Saurian Brandy? <br>
BASHIR: In the middle of a war, no less. <br>
NOG: It's a busy Starbase. I may be a Cadet, but I'm still a Ferengi. <br>
DAX: Lucky for us. <br>
(O'Brien enters with a metre long canister.) <br>
O'BRIEN: Excuse me, Captain. The power cell from the phaser array. We
used it up on the last mission. <br>
(Sisko takes the canister.) <br>
SISKO: Take a good look at this, people. It says something about this
ship. It says that we will fight and we will keep on fighting until we
can't fight anymore. <br>
ALL: Yes, sir! <br>
SISKO: You don't just throw something like this away. <br>
ALL: No, sir! <br>

canisters. Cheers and applause.) <br>

SISKO: Just a little ritual we fell into. Kind of helps the crew
unwind. <br>
ROSS: Well, they deserve it. They did a hell of a job. <br>
SISKO: Thank you, sir. But you didn't come here to tell me that, did
you? <br>
ROSS: No, I didn't. Ever since this war began, the Dominion's been able
to outmanoeuvre us at every turn. No matter where we send our ships,
they seem to be there waiting for us. <br>
SISKO: I've noticed that. <br>
ROSS: It's enough to make you think they were smarter than we are. But
they're not. They just had an edge that we didn't know about until
yesterday. Starfleet Intelligence located a massive sensor array hidden
on the periphery of the Argolis cluster. Damn thing's capable of
monitoring ship movements over five sectors. <br>
SISKO: That's how they've managed to stay one step ahead of us. <br>
ROSS: They've had an enormous tactical advantage. I want you to take it
away from them. <br>
SISKO: Gladly, sir. <br>
ROSS: It won't be easy. The array is heavily defended. This is the
intelligence report. Look it over. I want an attack plan on my desk by

ROM: There he is. <br>
KIRA: Damar's a creature of habit, all right. After a hard day at work,
he deserves his glass of kanar. Why are the Jem'Hadar always in here,
he asks himself. They don't drink, they don't eat, they don't gamble.
All they do is take up space. Damar asks his bartender if he found a
PADD he was working on the other day. <br>
ROM: My brother tells the truth. He hasn't seen it. <br>
KIRA: Damar doesn't like that. The PADD contained a draft copy of a
secret memorandum he was working on concerning the shortage of White.
In it he speculates that without the drug, the Jem'Hadar will run amok,
killing everyone and everything in their path. Damar recommends that if
the Cardassians can't bring down the minefield and re-open the supply
line from the Gamma Quadrant, they should poison the last ration of
White, eliminating the Jem'Hadar before it's too late. How did you get
a hold of Damar's PADD anyway? <br>
ROM: I'm good with my hands. Here we go. They've seen him. <br>
(A Jem'Hadar goes over to Damar and flourishes something at him.) <br>
KIRA: The missing PADD. <br>
DAMAR: Where'd you find that? <br>
KIRA: Damar accuses them of stealing it. <br>
ROM: They say they found it outside their quarters, right where I left
it.<br>
DAMAR: Have your whole race thrown off this station! <br>
KIRA: I knew this was going to work. The Cardassians and Jem'Hadar can
pretend to be allies, but they hate each other. <br>
(Quark tries to intervene and gets thrown over the bar.) <br>
DAMAR: Get out of my way! <br>

DUKAT: I don't care what they did. You should never have let this
situation get out of hand. Get out! <br>

WEYOUN: How could Damar have been so stupid as to leave such an
inflammatory document lying around for anyone to find? <br>
DUKAT: Your men stole it from him. <br>
WEYOUN: Jem'Hadar are not thieves. <br>
DUKAT: And Damar is not a liar. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: according to Intelligence, the array is
capable of detecting cloaked ships as far away as two light years. By
the time the Defiant goes around the Argolis Cluster, the Dominion will
already know we were coming. <br>
ROSS: You'll have a dozen Jem'Hadar ships on you before you even got
close. <br>
SISKO: That's why we need to have the element of surprise on our side.
It's the only way. <br>
ROSS: What are you suggesting? <br>
SISKO: That I take the Defiant through the Argolis. <br>
ROSS: You can't take a ship through there. You'd be cut to pieces by
the gravimetric shear. <br>
SISKO: That's exactly what the Dominion thinks. But if we come at them
from the Argolis, they wouldn't know what hit them. <br>
ROSS: What makes you think you can get through? <br>
SISKO: Dax says she can navigate around the gravimetric distortions.
She's studied proto-star clusters, she knows what to look for. It's a
gamble, but it's one I'm willing to take. <br>
ROSS: All right. Let's give it a shot. When can you leave? <br>

ODO: Well? Don't you have something to say to me? <br>
KIRA: About what happened at Quark's? It worked better than I expected.
<br>
ODO: I knew you were behind it. <br>
KIRA: Of course you did. We discussed it at our last resistance
meeting. <br>
ODO: And I said it was a bad idea. <br>
KIRA: Yes, you did. And then you walked out of the room like there was
nothing left to say. But Rom and Jake stayed and we discussed it, and
you know what? I decided it was a good idea. <br>
ODO: So you went ahead and did it behind my back? <br>
KIRA: Why are you taking it so personally? <br>
ODO: How do you expect me to take it? I spend my days sitting on the
Council with Dukat and Weyoun, doing whatever I can to make sure Bajor
survives this war intact. The last thing I need is to have you running
around causing mayhem. Do you have any idea what Dukat would do if he
found out you were behind it? It's all the excuse he would need to
throw every Bajoran off this station. <br>
KIRA: The Federation is losing this war. We can't sit by and do
nothing. <br>
ODO: There are limits to what we can do. <br>
KIRA: I'm beginning to think you shouldn't have agreed to sit on that
Council. It's as if you're so invested in making sure the station runs
smoothly, you've forgotten there's a war going on. <br>
ODO: Are you questioning my loyalties, Major? <br>
KIRA: I need you, Odo. The resistance needs you. <br>
ODO: Answer me. Are you questioning my loyalties? <br>

KIRA: Are you sure? <br>
(Odo nods and Kira leaves.) <br>
FOUNDER: You called her Nerys. <br>
ODO: What of it? <br>
FOUNDER: Well, you used to call her Major. Using the name of a solid
denotes intimacy. <br>
ODO: You're a long way from home. Here to keep an eye on the war
effort? <br>
FOUNDER: I'm content to leave the details of the war to the Vorta. <br>
ODO: Then what brings you to Deep Space Nine? <br>
FOUNDER: You. I was trapped in the Alpha Quadrant when Captain Sisko
mined the entrance to the wormhole. I have spent too much time with
solids. I came because I felt the need to be with one of my own. <br>
ODO: Well, that's ironic, considering what happened the last time we
crossed paths. <br>
FOUNDER: You caused the death of a fellow changeling, Odo. Turning you
into a solid was the only punishment severe enough for your crime. <br>
ODO: And now that I'm a changeling again, you come here as if nothing
ever happened? <br>
FOUNDER: We have forgiven you. <br>
ODO: Well, I haven't forgiven you. <br>
FOUNDER: It is time to put the past behind us, Odo. <br>
ODO: What about the present? You're waging a war against my home. <br>
FOUNDER: This is not your home. You belong with your own kind, as part
of the Great Link. <br>
ODO: I'm quite content here, thank you. <br>

becoming. Perhaps if we spend some time together, you might begin to
understand.

known the simple pleasure spending time existing as a stone or a

great sadness. If only you'd stayed with us, Odo. <br>

understand that the Federation doesn't pose a threat to her people. <br>
KIRA: You believe you can convince her to call off the war? <br>
ODO: If you could experience the Link, you'd understand the effect it
has on my people. You'd realise that anything is possible. I'm only
beginning to understand it all myself. I still have so many questions.
Now that she's here, I have a chance to find some answers. <br>

There's too much at stake. After the war is over, do whatever you need
to do. If you feel you need to go and join the Great Link, I'm not
going to stop you. But for right now, I need you here, focused. Please
promise me that you're not going to Link with her again. Not until this

KIRA: What are you talking about? <br>
QUARK: He said he came up with a way to deactivate the mines. Dukat
wants him to start field tests right away. <br>
(During the break they start pouring coffee into Quark.) <br>
KIRA: Come on, Quark, think. Did Damar say anything about how he was
planning to deactivate the mines? <br>
QUARK: Yes. He said something about the station's defector. <br>
ODO: Defector? <br>
KIRA: That's impossible. The only person on the station who knows
anything about the mines work is <br>
ROM: Me. <br>
QUARK: Defector. That doesn't sound right. Maybe it was deflector?
Yeah, that's it. He said something about using the station's deflector
array. <br>
KIRA: What do you think, Rom? <br>
ROM: I'm glad it wasn't me. <br>
KIRA: About the deflector array. Is there any way to use it to
deactivate the mines? <br>
ROM: No. I designed the mines to be self-replicating. The only way to
keep them from replacing themselves is to isolate them in an
anti-graviton beam. The deflector array can't do that. Unless you
reconfigure the field generators and re-focused the emitters which
would turn the deflector array into one big anti-graviton beam. <br>
QUARK: Why didn't you think of that when you set up the minefield? <br>
ROM: I don't know. <br>
QUARK: He doesn't know. <br>
KIRA: Quark. How can we disable the deflector array? <br>
ROM: All you have to do to is access the EPS feed and overload the
waveguide. <br>
KIRA: Let's do it. <br>
ROM: But there's no way to get to the EPS feed. It's in a secured
conduit rigged with alarms. <br>
KIRA: Odo, can you disable those alarms? <br>
ODO: I can take them offline for about five minutes if I run a security
diagnostic. <br>
KIRA: Will that give you enough time? <br>
ROM: I think so. <br>
ODO: I'll run the diagnostic as soon as I get to my office in the
morning. <br>
KIRA: All right. You and I will meet here. At exactly oh eight hundred,
you will begin the diagnostic. </font></p>

WORF [on wallscreen]: Yes, sir. But I sense it is more difficult for

ROSS: Ben, we've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow. I want to nail
down the details on the Bolian operation. I need you focused. <br>
SISKO: I will be. <br>
ROSS: I know how you feel about your crew, but you and I are
responsible for an entire tactical wing. Thousands of lives depend on
the decisions we make tomorrow. You can't afford to be awake all night
worrying about one ship. <br>
SISKO: Admiral, you can order me to my quarters, but there's no way I'm
going to sleep. Not as long as the Defiant is out there. <br>
ROSS: All right, as you wish. But you should understand one thing. With
any luck, we'll be sending the Defiant on a lot of missions, and you're
going to have to get used to it. Good night.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: Have our people always been shape-shifters, or
was there a time when we were like the solids? <br>
FOUNDER: Eons ago we were like them, limited to one form, but then we
evolved. <br>
ODO: On the homeworld, are you always in the Link, or do you sometimes
take solid form? <br>
FOUNDER: We prefer the Link, but on occasion it is interesting to exist
as something else. A tree perhaps, or a cloud in the sky. <br>
ODO: A cloud. How many of us are there? <br>
FOUNDER: Oh. So many questions, Odo. <br>
ODO: I'm sorry. But there's still so much that isn't clear to me yet. <br>
FOUNDER: If you Link with me again, everything will be made clear to
you. <br>
ODO: You have to understand that the Link is very overwhelming for me.
Right now, it's easier to talk. <br>
FOUNDER: But words are so clumsy, so imprecise. <br>
ODO: Even so. <br>
FOUNDER: As you wish. <br>
ODO: You haven't told me your name. <br>
FOUNDER: What use would I have for a name? <br>
ODO: To differentiate yourself from the others. <br>
FOUNDER: I don't. <br>
ODO: But you are a separate being, aren't you? <br>
FOUNDER: In a sense. <br>
ODO: When you return to the Link, what will happen to the entity I'm
talking to right now? <br>
FOUNDER: The drop becomes the ocean. <br>
ODO: And if you choose to take solid form again? <br>
FOUNDER: The ocean becomes a drop. <br>
ODO: Ah, yes. I think I'm beginning to understand. <br>
FOUNDER: Then you can answer your own question. How many of us are
there? <br>
ODO: One. And many. It depends on how you look at it. <br>
FOUNDER: Very good. You are beginning to understand. But there's so
much you don't know. <br>
ODO: Tell me. <br>
FOUNDER: Words would be insufficient. Link with me again. It is the
only way I can give you the understanding that you seek. <br>
ODO: I can't. <br>
FOUNDER: Why not? <br>
ODO: I promised Kira. <br>
FOUNDER: She is a solid. This has nothing to do with her. This is about
you, about what you want.
