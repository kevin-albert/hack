Moore. He wanted to discuss this. <br>
(He plays a regular sound pattern) <br>
PICARD: Recognise it? <br>
RIKER: Sounds like it might be an SOS. <br>
PICARD: Good guess. You're quicker than Starbase research. It took them
hours to determine this was a distress beacon. <br>
RIKER: When was it detected? <br>
PICARD: Last month. Just kicked in without any warning. <br>
RIKER: Who used the beacon? <br>
PICARD: It's Terran. <br>
RIKER: Captain, I'm familiar with most Earth codes, and <br>
PICARD: Interesting. Yes, that code hasn't been used in centuries. <br>
RIKER: What was its origin point? <br>
PICARD: Ficus sector. <br>
RIKER: Captain, I don't think there's any record of an Earth colony in
that area. <br>
PICARD: Now we know there's someone out there and they're asking for
help. <br>
RIKER: But who? <br>
PICARD: Let's try and find out. Computer, download all information
regarding signal beacon from Starbase mainframe. <br>
COMPUTER: Distress beacon used by the European Hegemony. <br>
RIKER: The European Hegemony? <br>
PICARD: A loose alliance formed in the early part of the twenty second
century. It was the first stirrings of world
government. You should read more history, Number One. Computer, locate
exact dates in which this signal beacon was in general use. <br>
COMPUTER: Old Earth calendar, 2123 until 2190. <br>
RIKER: No extraterrestrial source ever used this code? <br>
COMPUTER: Negative. <br>
PICARD: Locate all Earth deep space launches from 2123 until 2190, with
a destination in or near the Ficus sector. <br>
COMPUTER: Working. <br>
(The usual list of staff names appear as commanders of various vessels,
including Melinda Snodgrass and Gene Roddenberry) <br>
RIKER: Nothing for Ficus. <br>
PICARD: Damn it, who's out there? <br>

WORF: I did not faint. Klingons do not faint. <br>
PULASKI: Excuse me, I'll rephrase. This Klingon suffered a dramatic
drop in blood pressure, his blood glucose level dropped, there was
deficient blood flow resulting from circulatory failure. In other
words, he curled up his toes and laid unconscious on the floor. <br>
WORF: Doctor, there is no need to insult me. <br>
PULASKI: Worf, I am worried. Now, something is wrong. Klingons don't
faint. Forgive me. I just can't think of another word that applies.
You're sick. <br>
WORF: Klingons do not give in to illness. <br>
PULASKI: Just stay right where you are. I have to check something with
the computer. Lieutenant, you have rop'ngor. <br>
WORF: But that is a childhood ailment! <br>
PULASKI: Yes. <br>
WORF: How shall I live down the humiliation? <br>
PULASKI: Worf, you can't help. <br>
WORF: Still, for a warrior to find himself in such a situation. <br>
PULASKI: So you've got the Klingon version of the measles. <br>
WORF: How would Commander Riker feel if he had the measles. <br>
PULASKI: Pretty silly. <br>
PICARD [OC]: Doctor Pulaski, how is Lieutenant Worf? <br>
PULASKI: He's in no danger. Worf was just observing a Klingon ritual
involving fasting, and he didn't take into account that you have to
decrease your physical activity as you decrease your caloric intake.
Pulaski out. <br>

DATA: Captain, I have been considering the problem of the missing ship.
Although there is no record of a launch to the Ficus sector, which
would not be unusual considering the chaos of the early twenty second
century, someone had to load that ship. <br>
PICARD: The manifest. <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: There it is. SS Mariposa, loaded 27th November, 2123.
Destination Ficus sector. Captain Walter Granger, commanding. <br>
DATA: Mariposa. The Spanish word for butterfly. <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Data. <br>
DATA: I thought it might be significant, sir. <br>
PICARD: It doesn't appear to be, Data. <br>
DATA: No, sir. <br>
PICARD: You learn a lot about people from their luggage. Two hundred
and twenty five Yoshimitsu computers, five monitor beacon satellites,
seven
hundred cellular commlinks, fifty spinning wheels. <br>
DATA: (over Picard) Spinning wheels? Accessing. A device for spinning
yarn or thread that consists of a large foot or hand driven wheel and
one spindle. <br>
PICARD: Cattle, chickens, pigs. Not DNA, the actual livestock.
Incredible. Why would anyone carry such an insane mix of cargo? <br>
DATA: Spindle, a thin rounded tapering rod <br>
PICARD: Data! <br>
DATA: Perhaps they were planning for the worst, sir. <br>
PICARD: Theorise, Data. Give me some background. <br>
DATA: In the early twenty-second century, Earth was recovering from
World War Three. A major philosopher of the period was Liam Dieghan,
founder of the Neo-Transcendentalists, who advocated a return to a
simpler life in which one lived in harmony with nature, and learned
under her gentle tutelage <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Data. But if this was a ship full of utopians, why
carry all this technological baggage? <br>

theory, sir. </font></p>

ever performed the Klingon tea ceremony for me. <br>
(She places some stones and a flower in the cups) <br>
PULASKI: There, that should do it. <br>
WORF: You know the ceremony? <br>
PULASKI: I understand the externals, not the mysteries. I'm not a
Klingon. <br>
WORF: You must not drink the tea. It is deadly to humans. <br>
PULASKI: And none too good for Klingons. <br>
WORF: It is a test of bravery, of one's ability to look at the face of
mortality. It is also a reminder that death is an experience best
shared, like the tea. <br>
PULASKI: Worf, you're a romantic. <br>
WORF: It is among the Klingons that love poetry achieves its fullest
flower. <br>
PULASKI: Hold that thought. <br>
(She dashes into Sickbay, returns with a hypo and injects herself) <br>
PULASKI: Antidote. If we're going to share, let's share. (they drink)
Now, quote me a little of that poetry.

DATA: Aye, sir. The system's sun has entered a period of severe flare
activity. <br>
RIKER: Now we know what triggered the SOS. <br>
DATA: Class M readings from the fifth planet in the system. <br>
PICARD: Take us in. <br>
WORF: Shields at maximum. <br>
DATA: Sensors indicate human life form readings thirty metres below the
planet's surface. <br>
WORF: Hailing on all frequencies. No response so far, but the flares
may be interfering with communications. <br>
DATA: There is no evidence of an advanced communication network. <br>
PICARD: They brought a lot of technology. Where is it? <br>
WORF: There is no artificial power source on the planet. <br>
DATA: The stellar flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency.
Computer projections indicate they will brush the planet in three point
six hours. <br>
WORF: Evacuation will be difficult. We can lower our shields for
transport only between the flares. <br>
TROI: Captain, these people have been isolated for three hundred years.
They could be very unsophisticated. The shock of suddenly being
transported onto a spaceship could frighten them, to say the least. <br>

PULASKI: Tell me, is your entire population made up of clones, Prime
Minister? <br>
WORF: Clones? <br>
RIKER: Clones? <br>
GRANGER: Clones.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, supplemental. Prime Minister Granger
has requested an urgent meeting to discuss the future of the Mariposan
colony. I've invited him to the Enterprise. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Observation lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GRANGER: Captain, we need your help. Three hundred
years ago during our landing on Mariposa, the skin of our ship was
breached. Only five of the colonists survived. The progenitors weren't
willing to just give up and die, and they were scientists <br>
PICARD: So, they used that expertise and turned to cloning. <br>
GRANGER: Yes. We had no other option. Two women and three men
represented an insufficient gene pool from which to build a society. <br>
PULASKI: How did you suppress the natural sexual drive? Drugs? Punitive
laws? <br>
GRANGER: In the beginning, a little bit of each. Now, after three
hundred years, the entire concept of sexual reproduction is a little
repugnant to us. <br>
PULASKI: How did you overcome the problem of replicative fading? <br>
GRANGER: We haven't. <br>
PULASKI: You have got a problem. <br>
RIKER: Wait. I don't understand replicative fading. <br>
PULASKI: Each time you clone, you're making a copy of a copy. Subtle
errors creep into the chromosomes, and
eventually you end up with a non-viable clone. <br>
PICARD: How can we help you? <br>
GRANGER: We need an infusion of fresh DNA. I was hoping that you would
be willing to share some tissue samples. <br>
RIKER: You want to clone us? <br>
GRANGER: Yes. <br>
RIKER: No way, not me. <br>
GRANGER: How can you possibly be harmed? <br>
RIKER: It's not a question of harm. One William Riker is unique,
perhaps even special. But a hundred of him, a thousand of him
diminishes me in ways I can't even imagine. <br>
GRANGER: You would be preserving yourself. <br>
RIKER: Human beings have other ways of doing that. We have children. <br>
PICARD: I think you will find that attitude prevalent among all the
Enterprise people. <br>
GRANGER: I see. Well, if you are not willing to share your DNA, will
you at least send some people to repair our malfunctioning equipment? <br>
PICARD: Yes, of course. Number One, put a technical team together.
Let's get these repairs underway. <br>
RIKER: Yes, sir. Lieutenant La Forge. Prepare a technical support away
team. Meet me in transporter room three. <br>
(Riker leaves) <br>
PULASKI: Captain, with your permission, I would like to return to the
planet. It could be my last opportunity to study replicative fading.
With your permission, of course, Mister Prime Minister. <br>
GRANGER: You'd be most welcome. Perhaps you will find a solution that
we have overlooked. <br>
PULASKI: Well, I appreciate the compliment, but I don't think that's
very likely. And repairing that equipment will certainly not solve your
problems. <br>
GRANGER: What other solution do we have? Doctor, remember, there are
only five of us. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, supplemental. Commander Riker and
Doctor Pulaski have returned to Mariposa with a team of Enterprise

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: The repairs are almost complete. I wish
there was something more we could do. <br>
GRANGER: Are you sure you won't reconsider? <br>
PULASKI: About the cloning? <br>
GRANGER: Yes. <br>
RIKER: Out of the question. <br>
(so an aide stuns Kate and Riker, and they are dragged off through
another door. Then Geordi enters) <br>LAFORGE: Excuse me, sir, I was
looking for Commander Riker. <br>
GRANGER: I'm afraid I haven't seen him. <br>
LAFORGE: Doctor Pulaski? <br>
GRANGER: Sorry, I can't help you. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, I guess I'll just have to hunt for them. Sorry to
disturb you.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: Hey. So what happened to you two down on
Mariposa? Is everything all right? <br>
RIKER: Is there any reason why it shouldn't be? <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah. Every time I asked where you were, some clone lied to
me. <br>
RIKER: Lied to you? <br>
LAFORGE: Commander, with this I can see better than your average
person. Now when someone lies there are certain physical
manifestations. Variations in blush response, pupil dilation, pulse,
breath rate. Doesn't always work with aliens, but humans? Got'em
nailed. <br>
PULASKI: The clones lied about our whereabouts? I don't remember
anything happening. I was working in their medical facility and got a
call to report to Granger's office. I ran into Will on the way <br>
LAFORGE: Now wait a minute. Granger said he hadn't seen either one of
you. Did you make it to his office? <br>
RIKER: I think, I don't remember. <br>
(Pulaski runs a medical tricorder over them all) <br>
LAFORGE: So what's the prognosis, Doc? <br>
PULASKI: Geordi, you'll be pleased to know that you're not missing any
epithelial cells. <br>
LAFORGE: Great. <br>
PULASKI: Will and I, however, are. <br>
RIKER: Meaning? <br>
PULASKI: Although you can clone from any cell in the body, the cells
lining the stomach are the best choice because they're relatively
undifferentiated. <br>
LAFORGE: Where are you going? <br>
RIKER: To their cloning lab.

GRANGER: Stop! Murderers! <br>
RIKER: Like hell! You're a damn thief! <br>
PULASKI: Gentlemen, please. <br>
GRANGER: What else could we do? We asked for your help and you refused
us. We're desperate. Desperate! <br>
RIKER: And that gave you the right to assault us, to rob us. <br>
GRANGER: We have the right to survive!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ready room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Doctor, how desperate is the colony's
situation? <br>
PULASKI: They've got two or three generations, then the fading will be
terminal. They're among the walking dead now. They just haven't been
buried. <br>
RIKER: I want the cloning equipment inspected. Who knows how many
tissue samples were stolen. We certainly have a right to exercise
control over our own bodies. <br>
PULASKI: You'll get no argument from me. <br>
TROI: I know the Mariposan culture seems alien, even frightening, but
really, we do have much in common. They're human beings fighting for
survival. Would we do any less? <br>
PICARD: Are you saying we should give them the DNA samples they
require? <br>
PULASKI: That's just postponing the inevitable. If they get an infusion
of fresh DNA, in fifteen generations they'll just go back to the same
problems. Cloning isn't the answer. What they need is breeding stock. <br>
PICARD: The Bringloidi. <br>
TROI: Yes. They have the energy and drive, and the clones possess the
emotional maturity and the technological knowledge. <br>
PICARD: They started out together. It seems only fitting they should
end up together. <br>
PULASKI: It's a match made in heaven. <br>
RIKER: Unfortunately it will have to be a shotgun wedding.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Observation lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GRANGER: I'm sorry, Captain, it's out of the
question. You're trying to dump your problems on us. We have problems
of our own. <br>
PICARD: Don't you understand? The Bringloidi can help you.
<br>GRANGER: Look at him. How could we ever integrate that into our
society? <br>
DANILO: You're no prize yourself. <br>
GRANGER: Primitive, hostile, disruptive. It would require enormous
effort to even educate them. <br>
DANILO: Oh, forget it, Captain Picard. I'm not going to come in here
with my hat in my hand begging charity from this blatherskite. <br>
PICARD: Now stop! I will not allow posturing and bigotry to destroy
this meeting. Now please, sit down. Now, Commander Riker has asked that
your
laboratories be inspected for stolen tissue samples, and I understand
his concern. We may have to transport all your equipment here, to the
Enterprise. <br>
GRANGER: I see. When reason fails, you'll resort to blackmail. <br>
PICARD: Fine. Destroy yourselves. <br>
PULASKI: It's not so bad, Captain. In fifty years we'll have a new
class M planet, complete with cities, and ready for colonisation. <br>
PICARD: You see, the end is closer than you like to think. <br>
GRANGER: I don't know. There are so many difficulties. <br>
DANILO: Look, man. We are decent, hard working people. We're willing to
learn. <br>
GRANGER: They're so different. <br>
PICARD: It is the differences that have made us strong. <br>
GRANGER: For three hundred years, we have denied the carnal side of our
nature. How can we learn to put that aside? <br>
DANILO: Well, you put a young couple together and you let nature take
its course. <br>
PULASKI: Now if this is going to work, you're going to have to alter
your society, too. Monogamous marriage will not be possible for several
generations. <br>
DANILO: I don't quite understand. <br>
PULASKI: Thirty couples are enough to create a viable genetic base. But
the broader the base the healthier and the safer the society. So it
will be best if each woman, Bringloidi and Mariposan, had at least
three children by three different men. <br>
DANILO: I think I could handle that, yes. <br>
GRANGER: Oh, God, it's so <br>
PICARD: Frightening? <br>
GRANGER: Repugnant. <br>
DANILO: So, it's a done deal? And here's my hand on it. (complete with
spit) Right, now, let's go and stake out my three women. Send in the
clones. <br>
PICARD: I must be out of my mind. <br>
PULASKI: Starfleet will probably agree with you.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DANILO: Excuse me, sir. Captain. Thank you. Brenna.
Brenna, a word. <br>
(He takes her behind some cargo modules to explain the agreement.
Meanwhile Granger gazes in awe at a very pregnant woman) <br>
BRENNA: Isn't that just like a man! You make these grandiose decisions,
but you never stop to consider the poor women. <br>
PICARD: Miss Odell, I <br>
BRENNA: You men draw a mug, and solve all the problems of the world
while the beer goes down, but, when it comes to the practical matters,
it always falls to the women to make your grand dreams come true. <br>
PICARD: Miss Odell, you were the one who wanted a new home. <br>
BRENNA: But I don't know if I want to be Eve. <br>
PICARD: It's your choice. If you wish, you can stay on the Enterprise.
We will drop you at a starbase, then you can go where you wish. <br>
BRENNA: Leave my da? <br>
PICARD: If this is going to work, these people will need your strength,
your guidance. <br>
BRENNA: Oh, damn. What does he do again? <br>
PICARD: Prime Minister. <br>
BRENNA: Sounds important. <br>
PICARD: Oh, it is. <br>
BRENNA: Sounds like he might have more than two coins to rub together.
