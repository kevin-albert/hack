KIRA: Commander, I just received word that a Valerian transport has
requested permission to dock here at the station. <br>
SISKO: Let me guess. You're here to recommend that we deny that
request. <br>
KIRA: The Valerians ran weapons-grade dolamide to Cardassian forces
during the occupation of Bajor. <br>
SISKO: I'm aware of that. <br>
KIRA: I believe they're continuing to ship weapons to the Cardassians.
Weapons that could eventually be used to attack Bajor. <br>
SISKO: I share your concern, Major. But unless we have proof to back up
those charges <br>
KIRA: The proof is on that ship. Let me conduct a search and if I find
any dolamide, we can confiscate it. <br>
SISKO: I'm afraid it's not that simple. Dolamide is used for power
generators, reactors, in short-range transports. <br>
KIRA: And for weapons. <br>
SISKO: Only if it's extremely pure. <br>
KIRA: So we're going to do nothing. <br>
SISKO: I didn't say that. We just can't board their ship and start
tearing it apart. <br>
KIRA: Well, what can we do? <br>
SISKO: You bring me evidence that the Valerians are dealing in
weapons-grade dolamide and I promise you the Federation will use every
kind of diplomatic pressure to stop them. <br>
KIRA: You think that'll work? <br>
SISKO: It will if the Valerians want to continue trading with the
Federation. <br>
KIRA: All right. We'll try it your way. <br>
SISKO: Good. Then you will see to it that the Valerian ship is cleared
for docking. <br>
KIRA: Yes, sir.

processing centre at Lasuma. I'm glad it's not me. <br>
(Odo enters) <br>
ODO: Here's the information you requested on the captain of the
Valerian ship. <br>
KIRA: Let me know if you find anything else. <br>
DAX: Sensors are reading elevated neutrino levels at the wormhole.
Something's coming through. <br>
KIRA: On screen. <br>
(WHOOSH) <br>
KIRA: Kira to Sisko. You'd better come out here. <br>
DAX: It's the Klingon vessel Toh'Kaht. <br>
KIRA: They weren't due back for another month. <br>
SISKO: Open hailing frequencies. <br>
(KaBOOM!) <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm reading a transporter signal. Someone must have beamed off
the ship just as it exploded. <br>
(the transporter beam is not behaving) <br>
SISKO: Mister O'Brien? <br>
O'BRIEN: Something's interfering with the rematerialisation process. <br>
DAX: Lock on with our transporter signal. Try boosting the annular
containment field. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm already there. <br>
(The Klingon solidifies and collapses) <br>
BASHIR: He's been hit by weapons fire. It's severe. We've got to get
him to cryostasis. <br>

chest and upper arms. If that was all, we could have saved him, but
those weapon burns were too severe. <br>
SISKO: Is there any way to identify the kind of weapon used? <br>
BASHIR: I'm running a microtissue analysis right now. I should have the
results in a couple of hours. <br>
KIRA: The Klingon said victory just before he died. I wonder what he
meant. <br>
DAX: According to Klingon High Command, the Toh'Kaht was in the Gamma
quadrant on a routine bio-survey mission, <br>
O'BRIEN: Victory during a bio-survey? <br>
ODO: As I recall the Toh'Kaht put in for a maintenance check. <br>
SISKO: Ask around the station, see what you can learn about this
bio-survey. <br>
(Odo leaves) <br>
SISKO: Dax and O'Brien, I'd like the two of you to take a runabout and
try to find the Toh'Kaht's mission recorder. I want to know what caused
that ship to explode. <br>
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. <br>

VALERIAN [on monitor]: Deep Space Nine, this is Valerian vessel Sherval
Das. We are entering the Bajoran system, clear us for docking. <br>
KIRA: Negative, Sherval Das. There's going to be a slight delay. <br>
VALERIAN [on monitor]: We are in need of maintenance. It's been a long
journey. <br>
KIRA: Oh, I'm sure it has, but we have our own problems. You'll just
have to wait. <br>
SISKO: Stand by, Sherval Das. <br>
(pauses transmission) <br>
SISKO: I'd like an explanation. <br>
KIRA: I wasn't finished running a background check on their ship. <br>
SISKO: We agreed there would be no delays in the docking procedure. <br>
KIRA: They just visited Fahleena Three and Mariah Four, the same two
stops they used to make when they were running dolamide to the
Cardassians. The last stop would be the purification plant on Ultima
Thule. Now if I can place them there, we'll know they're running
weapons-grade material. <br>
SISKO: Your ship has been cleared for docking. <br>
VALERIAN [on monitor]: Thank you, Commander. Sherval Das out. <br>

the Klingons the last time they came through. <br>
QUARK: Spare me from beings who think pain is pleasure. In small doses,
perhaps, but the Klingons? They're hard on the holosuites, they wreck
the furniture. I'm still fixing the walls of holosuite six. I'm not
saying they don't spend big. I'm just saying by the time you figure in
the damage, I'm lucky to break even. <br>
ODO: They do tend toward bluster, don't they? Throwing their weight
around, bragging. <br>
QUARK: This crew was worse than the last. Our glorious mission. I said,
what's so glorious about a gamma quadrant bio-survey? <br>
ODO: And what did they say? <br>
QUARK: Crafty tonight, Odo, aren't we? Looking for clues about the fate
of the Klingons. If I tell you what I heard, what do I get in return? <br>
ODO: The chances are what you heard won't help, so why should I give
you something for it? <br>
QUARK: Because otherwise, I heard nothing. <br>
ODO: That damaged holosuite. Work crew seven is probably doing the
repairs, am I right? <br>
QUARK: Ah, ha. <br>
ODO: Well it looks as though I might have to put in a priority request
for work crew seven. The bulkheads in security could use a little
shoring up. <br>
QUARK: They said they'd be coming back through the wormhole with
something that would make the enemies of the Klingon Empire tremble. <br>
ODO: Their exact words? <br>
QUARK: Direct quote. <br>
ODO: You've been most helpful. <br>

ODO: I don't remember anything, But I'm back to normal? <br>

couldn't tell you if it'll happen again. In fact, there's really
nothing more I can do here. <br>
ODO: Then thank you for your time, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: Tell me, Odo, Do you share my concern about this Valerian
situation? <br>
ODO: Concern? <br>
BASHIR: I think you know what I mean. <br>
ODO: Why don't you tell me and then you can be sure I know. <br>
BASHIR: Just don't be surprised if the uneasy alliance on this station
starts to show a few cracks. <br>
ODO: What uneasy alliance? <br>
BASHIR: Commander Sisko and Kira. Mark my words, there's going to be
trouble. <br>
ODO: What exactly are you basing all this on, Doctor? <br>
BASHIR: Very clever, Constable. But you're probably right. It's still
too early to commit oneself either way. <br>

KIRA: I've got them! <br>
SISKO: Who? <br>
(covers the PADD) <br>
KIRA: The Valerians. Their ship was at the Ultima Thule station one
week ago. That confirms it. They're definitely running dolamide. <br>
SISKO: So? <br>
KIRA: So I've got an armed team ready to board their vessel. We
confiscate the material and send them back where they came from.
Frankly, I'm half-tempted to take them to Bajor and press charges. <br>
SISKO: By whose authority? <br>
KIRA: You're not going to do anything about this. <br>
SISKO: I'm not. And neither are you. <br>
KIRA: That ship is acting against Bajoran interests. This station is
Bajoran property. <br>

challenging that, Major? <br>

debris. <br>
O'BRIEN: Looks like duranium alloy. Probably pieces of the Klingon's
secondary hull. <br>
DAX: It's possible their mission recorder is somewhere in the debris.
The magnetic field from the duranium could be masking it. <br>
O'BRIEN: Let's get a little closer. Major Kira's been awfully
aggressive toward Commander Sisko lately about station policy. <br>
DAX: An honest difference of opinion. <br>
O'BRIEN: What if it's more than a difference of opinion? What if Kira
thinks the Bajorans don't need us on DS Nine? It is their station. <br>
DAX: That would be suicidal. Without a Federation presence, Bajor would
be vulnerable again to the Cardassians. <br>
O'BRIEN: That doesn't mean there aren't plenty of misguided Bajorans
who think they can go it alone. You've become quite friendly with Major
Kira, haven't you? <br>
DAX: Have I? Well, yes, I suppose I have, if you say so. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, I wouldn't get too friendly with the natives if I were
you. Remember where your loyalties lie. <br>
DAX: Of course. Benjamin and I have been close for a long time. Hand
and glove. I'm on his side. No question about it. That reminds me of
the time we found ourselves <br>
O'BRIEN: Good. Anyone who's against Sisko is against me. I'm picking up
a weak subspace transponder signal. It's the mission recorder.

pretty well together, you and I. <br>
ODO: Yes, I suppose our relationship has always been cooperative. <br>
KIRA: Exactly. And that's just what I need right now. Your cooperation.
I'm convinced the Valerians have dolamide on board, but the evidence is
still circumstantial. I need solid proof. I want you to slip past their
security systems and into their cargo bay. <br>
ODO: I heard that Commander Sisko was adamant about not interfering
with the Valerian ship. Has he changed his mind? <br>
KIRA: Yes. <br>
ODO: How odd. Very well. I'll keep the two of you informed of my

of energy spheres which possess some type of telepathic archive. The
spheres described an ancient power struggle that destroyed a race
called the Saltah'na. We will forward these results to our science
division.

O'BRIEN: Kira's already locked down the Valerian ship, and she's
diverted half the station's systems to her control. <br>
SISKO: Since when? <br>
O'BRIEN: An hour ago. I've heard some disturbing rumours from our
people on the Promenade. I think she's going to make an attempt on your
life. <br>
SISKO: I want you to arrest them. Kira and every Bajoran officer on
this station. I want the names of every sympathizer <br>
O'BRIEN: That's not a good idea, sir. There's a lot more of them than
there are of us. If we tip our hand, it might work against us. <br>
SISKO: What can we do? <br>
O'BRIEN: Leave the station. <br>
SISKO: Never! Get me a phaser! I'll get rid of Kira! <br>
O'BRIEN: Hear me out, sir. We leave the station, raise a Federation
attack force and return. On that day, we'll get rid of all your
enemies. <br>
SISKO: How do we proceed? <br>
O'BRIEN: I need a few more hours to free up the Valerian ship. I've
already talked to their Captain. He's more than happy to take us back
to Federation space. <br>
SISKO: Call me as soon as you're ready. <br>

officer) <br>
BASHIR: It'll take effect in two minutes. Plenty of time to get a good
(Odo enters) Plenty of time for you to get a good night's sleep. <br>
BAJORAN: Thank you, Doctor. <br>
(The Bajoran officer leaves) <br>
BASHIR: Chronic insomnia. I think it's hormonal. So, how are you? <br>
ODO: I take it you've completed your autopsy of the Klingon. <br>
BASHIR: Of course. You know, Odo, events have been moving rapidly since
our last conversation. I'd advise you to choose sides now or risk
finding yourself without any friends at all. <br>
ODO: The Klingon, Doctor, what did you find? <br>
BASHIR: He's still dead, if that's what you mean. <br>
(Odo takes Bashir by the shoulders) <br>
ODO: I don't have time for jokes. Your findings could determine who
controls this station. <br>
BASHIR: How? <br>
ODO: All in good time. First, tell me about the Klingon. <br>
BASHIR: Well, I found nothing very unusual. The columnar cells in his
brain stem, perhaps. The membrane permeability was off. <br>
ODO: What could cause that? <br>
BASHIR: Any number of things. <br>
ODO: Could it have something to do with telepathy? The Klingons were
studying the telepathic archives of an ancient race. <br>
BASHIR: If those archives were contained in a self-sustaining energy
matrix, that could explain the changes in the Klingon's brain. <br>
ODO: Could that energy matrix have somehow caused them to re-enact the
power struggle that destroyed the Saltah'nans. <br>
BASHIR: Possibly. What are you getting at? <br>
ODO: Doctor, I believe the Klingon brought the matrix with him and
everyone in Ops was affected except me. Without a humanoid brain, my
system rejected it. <br>
BASHIR: An interesting theory, Constable, but I'm certainly not
behaving out of the ordinary. <br>
ODO: Of course not. But what if you and I are the only two who aren't
affected? <br>
BASHIR: Do you think we could use this to our advantage? <br>
ODO: Exactly. <br>
BASHIR: Tell me your plan. <br>
ODO: The first thing we have to do is figure out how to remove the
field from everyone affected. <br>
BASHIR: But then we'd lose our advantage. <br>
ODO: Would you prefer that someone blew up the station? <br>
BASHIR: I see your point. <br>
ODO: The power to control the energy matrix is the power to control
this station. <br>
BASHIR: If I could determine the natural resonance frequencies of this
telepathic field, I might be able to generate an interference signal
which could force it out. <br>
ODO: Do it. I promise, Doctor, you won't regret it.

O'BRIEN: Almost there, sir. We've got one more level of security
lockouts to break through and the Valerian ship will be ready to go. <br>

scanners. <br>
SISKO: Give it to Mister O'Brien. <br>
BAJORAN: I really think you should see this, sir. <br>

SISKO: Is it Kira?! Did Kira put you up to this? <br>
BAJORAN: No. <br>

how this works. <br>
