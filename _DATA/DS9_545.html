<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: The Dominion has solidified its hold on the
Kalandra Sector. They're trying to establish a supply line running
through Betazoid space into the Argolis
Cluster. <br>
WORF: If they succeed, they will be able to launch an attack against
Vulcan. <br>
SISKO: Starfleet's going to try to cut them off near the Tibor Nebula.
The Seventh Fleet will be engaging the enemy in the morning. <br>
DAX: The Seventh Fleet is still at half-strength. They took heavy
losses at Sybaron. <br>
SISKO: Well let's just hope they can get the job done. On a happier
note, I do have a bit of good news. <br>
BASHIR: That makes a welcome change. <br>
SISKO: The Romulans have forced the Dominion to retreat from the
Benzite system. <br>
ODO: That is good news. The question is, will the Romulans be willing
to leave Benzar after the war is over? Once they capture territory,
they very rarely give it up. <br>
SISKO: Right now, we need to concentrate on beating the Dominion. We'll
worry about the Romulans later. As some of you already know, Major
Kira, Jake and I will be leaving for Bajor at twenty two hundred. <br>
DAX: There's a war on. This is no time for a vacation. <br>
KIRA: The archaeologists excavating B'hala have found something they
want the Emissary to see. <br>
SISKO: We'll be returning tomorrow night. That's all, people. <br>
(Everyone leaves except Kira and Odo.) <br>
KIRA: Will the Romulans leave Benzar? You love to bring up the
worst-case scenario in these meetings, don't you? <br>
ODO: Somebody has to. Besides, everyone expects me to be dour and
suspicious. I don't want to disappoint them.
KIRA: If they only knew the real you. <br>
ODO: That is the real me. At least as far as everyone else is
concerned.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KORAL: (a monk) I can't tell you how pleased we are
by your visit, Emissary. <br>
SISKO: Glad to be here, Ranjen. <br>
KORAL: Oh, there's no need to keep calling me Ranjen. I'm a simple
monk. My order is quite informal. <br>
SISKO: You've certainly been busy. The last time I visited the ruins,
none of these tunnels had been cut yet. <br>
KORAL: It's been a great deal of work, but we do it gladly. Excavating
the Holy City is a privilege. Our efforts are an expression of our
faith in the Prophets and in the Emissary. <br>
SISKO: It's very inspiring to see. <br>
KIRA: Something wrong, Jake? <br>
JAKE: No. It's just that Dad seems to be taking his role as Emissary
very seriously these days. <br>
KIRA: You say that like you think it's a bad thing. <br>
JAKE: You have to admit, I mean, it's a long way to come to see some
old ruins. <br>
KIRA: They may have found some very important religious artefacts in
these old ruins. <br>
JAKE: Yeah, I hope so, otherwise I don't have a story. <br>
KIRA: Hey, try to look like you're enjoying yourself. Your father needs
this. It's good for him not to have to think about the Dominion for a
few hours. <br>
(Further on, squeaking.) <br>
KORAL: Oh, don't let the bats bother you. <br>
KIRA: Don't worry, they rarely bite.&nbsp;<br>
JAKE: Rarely? <br>
(And further still.) <br>
KORAL: We're directly below the Temple of B'hala. These walls predate
the ancient city by ten thousand years. <br>
(They stop in front of the remains of a carving on the wall.) <br>
JAKE: Who built this place? <br>
KORAL: We don't know much about the original inhabitants, but it
appears they abandoned this site some twenty five thousand years ago.
Over time, sediment buried the ruins. <br>
JAKE: And then B'hala was built on top of them. <br>
KORAL: Precisely. In here.

and leads them past a square column to an oval recess carved like the
familiar Bajoran symbol.) <br>
KORAL: It's over thirty thousand years old. <br>
SISKO: These inscriptions. They look like ancient Bajoran, but I can't
quite make it out. <br>
KORAL: Neither can we, though we've been able to piece together a few
of the translations. The syntax is unusual, but all forms of Bajoran
share certain root ideograms. You may recognise this one. <br>
SISKO: Welcome. <br>
KORAL: Here's where it gets interesting. <br>
(Kira comes in for a closer look as well, then looks at Sisko in
concern.) <br>
KORAL: I see you recognise it. <br>
JAKE: What? I don't. <br>
KIRA: It says, Welcome, Emissary. <br>
KORAL: Now you know why I asked you here.

SISKO: The reckoning? <br>
KIRA: Much will depend on the Sisko. <br>
KORAL: He is corporeal. <br>
JAKE: Limited. <br>
KIRA: He is the Sisko. He will not waver. <br>
JAKE: He is of Bajor. <br>
KIRA: He will bring the reckoning. <br>
SISKO: What is it you expect of me? <br>
KORAL: It will be the end. <br>
JAKE: Or the beginning. <br>

the wall. He's out cold for the opening titles.) <br>
JAKE: Dad, are you okay? <br>
SISKO: Yeah, right. The Prophets. They were here. They spoke to me. <br>
KORAL: You had a vision, Emissary? We saw nothing. <br>
KIRA: What did they say? <br>
SISKO: They mentioned something about a reckoning. Is that part of some
prophecy? <br>
KORAL: Not one that I know of. <br>
JAKE: Let's get out of here. <br>
SISKO: It's all right, Jake. We'll be leaving soon. I have got to find
out what these inscriptions say. <br>
KORAL: I wish we could translate them more quickly, but we don't have
the resources. <br>
SISKO: Fortunately, we do.

DAX: I had a pretty good idea what this was the minute I laid eyes on
it. That confirms it. It's a slab of stone with some writing on it. <br>
SISKO: Dax. <br>
DAX: What do you want me to say, Benjamin? I'm not picking up any
residual energy readings, certainly nothing that would explain how it
threw you across the room. <br>
SISKO: I want you to translate the inscriptions. <br>
DAX: I was afraid you were going to say that. <br>
SISKO: The Ranjen's translation programme. It's not complete, but at

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(At the top of an upper pylon.) <br>
SISKO: Welcome to Deep Space Nine, your Eminence. <br>
WINN: Thank you, Emissary. <br>
SISKO: What brings you to the station? <br>
WINN: I should think that would be clear. You removed an artefact from
an archaeological site without consulting the Vedek Assembly. <br>
SISKO: I meant no disrespect. <br>
(They walk and talk.) <br>
WINN: You can understand how we would be sensitive to such matters.
During the occupation, the Cardassians plundered Bajor's historical
treasures as if it were their right. I never imagined that you would
behave in the same manner. <br>
SISKO: I assure you that the artefact will be returned as soon as I've
finished studying it. <br>
WINN: I was not aware that you had expertise in Bajoran history. <br>
SISKO: I don't. <br>
WINN: Then why not leave the artefact in the hands of those who do?
There are scholars on Bajor who have devoted their lives to the study
of such things. <br>
SISKO: I understand, but I brought it here because I believe that's
what the Prophets want. <br>
WINN: I see. Then I take it this has something to do with your vision? <br>
SISKO: Exactly. <br>
WINN: Forgive me. I didn't realise that the Prophets told you to bring
the relic here. <br>
SISKO: Well, they didn't. Not in so many words. <br>
WINN: I see. Then exactly what did they say? <br>
SISKO: It's difficult to explain. The Prophets aren't always clear. <br>
WINN: Since they have never spoken to me, I'll have to take your word
for it. <br>
SISKO: All I know is, for now it belongs here. <br>
WINN: Who am I to argue with the Emissary of the Prophets?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Science lab]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: And then she contacted Starfleet and lodged
a formal protest. <br>
DAX: Is that why Admiral Ross wanted to talk to you? Well, how'd it go?
<br>
SISKO: He told me to stop meddling in Bajoran affairs and return the
damn tablet. <br>
DAX: You know how Starfleet feels about this Emissary thing. It makes
them very uncomfortable that you've allowed the Bajorans to view you as
a religious icon. It used to make you uncomfortable, too. <br>
SISKO: Not anymore. I guess the Prophets have spoken to me one too many
times. <br>
DAX: I remember when you used to call them wormhole Aliens. <br>
SISKO: Wormhole aliens or Prophets, it really doesn't matter. The fact
is, they exist out of time, and over the centuries they've given the
Bajorans glimpses of the future. Glimpses that the Bajorans have
written down to help them guide succeeding generations. If whatever is
written here can help me avoid mistakes, can help me make the right
decisions, then I'd be a fool to ignore it. <br>
DAX: Fair enough. But if you don't mind, I'm going to continue to think
of them as wormhole aliens. <br>
SISKO: All I know is that they have a relationship with Bajor that
stretches back over a thousand years. They care about what happens to
the Bajorans. They proved that when they kept the Dominion fleet from
coming through the wormhole. <br>
DAX: Didn't you have to talk them into it? Didn't they say they would
exact some kind of penance for helping you? <br>
SISKO: Yes, but they listened, and they saved Bajor and the rest of the
Alpha Quadrant. Now they're asking me for something in return. I don't
know what it is yet, but I'm not going to return the tablet until I do.
It's the key. I can feel it. <br>
(Translation matrix Bajor 576 is up on a wall monitor.) <br>
DAX: I hope you're wrong about that, Benjamin. <br>
SISKO: What have you got? <br>
DAX: The computer has translated part of the inscription. It probably
lacks the eloquence of the original passage, but you'll get the gist of
it. Here it is in modern Bajoran. <br>
SISKO: The time of reckoning is at hand. The Prophets will weep. Their
sorrow will consume the Gateway to the Temple. <br>
DAX: Tell me I'm wrong, but isn't the Gateway to the Temple Deep Space
Nine?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: I was just telling you what the translation
said. I did not say I believed it.&nbsp;<br>
BASHIR: Well, I'm not worried. If you look hard enough, you'll find a
Bajoran prophecy for just about anything. The Ancient Texts are a
tangle of vague contradictions. <br>
ODO: This one is anything but vague, and Bajoran prophecies have an odd
way of coming true. <br>
BASHIR: Don't say me you believe in this stuff, too? <br>
(Quark brings their drinks.) <br>
QUARK: Odo believes in preparing for the worst. <br>
ODO: True. <br>
QUARK: He's as bad as the Bajorans. Business hasn't been this slow
since the Dominion was here. You know, I feel I have a civic duty to do
something about all this doom and gloom, which is why I want to tell
you that I've extended happy hour. <br>
BASHIR: Extended it? <br>
QUARK: From now on, every hour is happy hour. At least until business
picks up. Eat, drink and be merry. <br>
BASHIR: For tomorrow we die. <br>
ODO: So, what does the Captain say about this? <br>
WORF: He's reserving judgement until the computer has finished the
translation.&nbsp;<br>
BASHIR: Who knows? The rest of the tablet probably says go to Quark's.
It's happy hour. <br>
QUARK: I like the way you think, Doctor. <br>
(Quark leaves.) <br>
BASHIR: Oh, this is ridiculous. Nothing's going to happen. Someday
we're going to look back on this and laugh. <br>

Most of the time. <br>
KIRA: Not today. I just wish that we knew more about the reckoning.
It'd give us a better idea of what the Prophets want from us. <br>
ODO: It seems to me that if the Prophets want the Bajoran people to
follow a given path, they should provide more specific directions. <br>
KIRA: It doesn't work like that. <br>
ODO: Maybe it should. <br>
KIRA: The Kai would say that you lack faith. <br>

This morning a tornado struck Tamulna. <br>
SISKO: Our sensors indicate that Bajor has been affected by the
instability of the wormhole.
<br>WINN: How comforting. Tell me, do your sensors have an explanation for
the instability itself? <br>
SISKO: No. <br>
WINN: Then I'll give you one. You've angered the Prophets by taking the
tablet from Bajor. As the spiritual leader of the Bajoran people, I'm
asking you to return it. <br>
SISKO: And as Emissary of the Prophets, I will ask you to give me more
time to study it. I believe it is the will of the Prophets. <br>
WINN: Well I disagree. This is a formal request from the First Minister
for you to turn over the relic to me. <br>

have been the greatest moment of her life. <br>

ODO: It's possible the power drain is related to this energy discharge
you saw. <br>
DAX: I'm starting to think the same thing. <br>
(Sisko hefts a fragment of stone.) <br>
DAX: Benjamin, you're not getting another urge, are you? <br>
SISKO: No. I've done what I needed to do. I know this might sound
strange, but I think the Prophets wanted me to shatter the tablet. <br>
DAX: Try explaining that to Kai Winn.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WINN: I can't believe that you'd be so petty as to
destroy the artefact rather than turn it over to me. <br>
SISKO: That's not why I did it. <br>
WINN: You expect me to believe that the Prophets wanted you to destroy
a priceless piece of Bajor's history? <br>
SISKO: That's exactly what you have to believe. <br>
WINN: And why would they do that? <br>
SISKO: I wish I had an answer for you. <br>
WINN: Well I'm sure you'll come up with something. <br>
SISKO: You and I haven't always seen things eye to eye, but we have one
thing in common. We both believe that the Prophets have a plan for
Bajor. Sometimes it's not easy to see the path they've laid out for us.
Right now, I don't know what they want from me, but I'm willing to take
a leap of faith and trust that they're guiding me, and I'm asking you
to take that leap with me.
WINN: There's no need for a leap of faith, Emissary. The Prophets have
made it quite clear. Two thirds of the Rakantha wheat harvest has been
destroyed by floods. Earthquakes have devastated Kendra Province,
leaving hundreds homeless. Bajorans are suffering because of you.
They're paying the price for your act of sacrilege. <br>
(Another power drain.) <br>
ODO [OC]: Odo to Captain Sisko. <br>
SISKO: Go ahead. <br>
ODO [OC]: You'd better come down to the Promenade, sir. <br>
SISKO: Is there a problem?&nbsp;<br>
ODO [OC]: I'll let you be the judge of that.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Kira is standing in the entrance to the Temple,
electricity crackling between her fingertips and the doorframe.) <br>
ODO: I think we've found the source of the power fluctuations. When I
tried to talk to her, she ignored me. <br>
(Possessed Kira comes over to Sisko and Winn. A strong wind blows down
the Promenade. Lights flicker and glasses explode. When Kira speaks,
her voice has an echo.) <br>
KIRA: You are the Sisko. <br>
SISKO: Keep your hands off your weapons. It's a Prophet. Why have you
taken this woman's body? <br>
KIRA: This vessel is willing. The reckoning. It is time. <br>
SISKO: The reckoning, what is it? <br>
KIRA: The end. Or the beginning. <br>
SISKO: I don't understand. <br>
KIRA: I await Kosst Amojan. <br>
WINN: The Evil One. A Pah-wraith banished from the Celestial Temple. <br>
SISKO: You're saying a Pah-wraith will take corporeal form as well? <br>
KIRA: The battle will be joined. <br>
SISKO: This battle, is it to be fought here? <br>
KIRA: Bajor will be reborn. <br>
WINN: Shabren's Fifth Prophecy. The rebirth. If the Evil One is
destroyed, it will bring a thousand years of peace. The Golden Age of
Bajor. <br>
SISKO: If it is destroyed? <br>
WINN: Who will prevail is not known. <br>
SISKO: What do you want from me? Am I supposed to help you in some way?
<br>
KIRA: The Sisko has completed his task. <br>
WINN: Forgive my blindness. <br>
(Kira walks away.) <br>
WINN: Prophet, hear me. I am the Kai of Bajor. I offer myself to you as
your humble servant, <br>
KIRA: I await their vessel. <br>
WINN: Speak to me. Tell me what I should do.

BASHIR: You can't be serious. <br>
SISKO: This battle could destroy the station. <br>
DAX: Then don't let it be fought here. <br>
SISKO: I don't have any choice. <br>
DAX: Yes, you do. We can flood the Promenade with chroniton radiation. <br>
WINN: Are you that suggesting we kill a Prophet? <br>
SISKO: I won't do that. <br>
BASHIR: You don't have to. If you ramp up the chroniton levels slowly,
it'll give the wormhole alien a chance to leave Kira's body without
getting hurt. <br>
DAX: We have everything rigged and ready to go. Just say the word. <br>
SISKO: No. <br>
DAX: Benjamin. <br>
WORF: Deep Space Nine is critical to the defence of the Federation. We
cannot risk destroying it. <br>
SISKO: When the Dominion fleet was about to come through the wormhole,
I asked the Prophets for their help. They gave it to me. Now they're
asking for my help. They need to fight this battle here, now. I'm not
going to jeopardise my crew, but I'm not going to stand in the way of
the Prophets either. <br>
BASHIR: What if the Prophets lose? Are you willing to sacrifice Kira? <br>
SISKO: The Prophet said she was willing to be their instrument. <br>
WORF: And you believe that? <br>
ODO: I do. I know how important her faith is to her and I have no doubt
that she would allow the Prophets to use her as their instrument. <br>
SISKO: I'll notify Starfleet that we're abandoning the station. Begin
the evacuation immediately.

DAX: What did Starfleet have to say? <br>
SISKO: I managed to convince them that we couldn't afford to defy the
Prophets. <br>
WORF: They are the only thing that's keeping the Dominion from coming
through the wormhole. <br>
DAX: The only problem is, there's no guarantee the Prophets will win
this battle. <br>

task was done. <br>
SISKO: I am Captain of this station and I will do everything in my

be victorious, do you? Rest assured, the Golden Age is upon us. The
Prophets and the people will be as one. Think of it. There will be no
need for Vedeks or Kais or even Emissaries. <br>

sparking from his fingers. His voice is deep and croaky and his eyes
glow red.) <br>
JAKE: Let it begin. <br>
(After the break, possessed Jake is down on the Promenade.) <br>
SISKO: Leave my son and take me instead. <br>
JAKE: Your Emissary offers himself to us. His faith wavers. <br>
(Jake throws Sisko back along the Promenade with a wave of his hand.
Energy plays over the possessed bodies, blue for good on Kira, red for
bad on Jake. Then a stream of energy comes out of each of them and
collides midway. The battle is joined. Veins stand out on
both combatants foreheads under the effort.) <br>

turbolift.) <br>

generator at your command. You can still end this, Ben. <br>
SISKO: No, I've got to play this thing out. <br>

not let anything happen to him. <br>
