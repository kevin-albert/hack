Captain's log, stardate 8031 in the twenty-third century. As commanding officer of the U.S.S. Enterprise, I look back on our most recent adventure and realise I could not have asked for a more dependable ship or dedicated crew. Chekov, Doctor McCoy, Uhura, Scotty, Sulu, and our late comrade, Spock, whose heroic sacrifice in our last mission is now deeply felt. Our ship and our lives have been endangered by an experimental project called Genesis designed to bring new life to barren moons. We sent Spock's body there to rest in peace.

SARATOGA CAPTAIN (OC): What do you make of it?<BR>
SARATOGA HELMSMAN: It appears to be a probe, Captain, from an intelligence unknown to us.<br>
SARATOGA CAPTAIN: Continue transmitting, universal 'Peace' and 'Hello' in all known languages. ...Get me Starfleet Command.<br>
SARATOGA HELMSMAN: Ready, Captain.<br>
SARATOGA CAPTAIN: Starfleet Command, this is U.S.S. Saratoga patrolling Sector Five, Neutral Zone. We are tracking a probe of unknown origin on apparent trajectory to the Terran solar system. Attempts to communicate with the probe have been negative on all known frequencies.<br>
STARFLEET VOICE (on intercom): Continue tracking, Saratoga. We will analyse transmissions and advise.<br>

(on the viewscreen the Enterprise self-destructs)<br>
KLINGON AMBASSADOR: Hold the image. Hold! ...Behold! The quintessential devil in these matters! James T. Kirk, renegade and terrorist! Not only is he responsible for the murder of a Klingon crew, the theft of a Klingon vessel. See now the real plot and intentions, Even as this Federation was negotiating a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo, conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself! The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called 'The Genesis Planet' ...A secret base from which to launch the annihilation of the Klingon people! We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!<br>
SAREK: Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mister President. ...Genesis was perfectly named. The creation of life not death. The Klingons shed the first blood while attempting to possess its secrets.<br>
KLINGON AMBASSADOR: Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of this Federation!<br>
SAREK: Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?<br>
KLINGON AMBASSADOR: We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!<br>
SAREK: Do you have the right to commit murder?<br>
FEDERATION PRESIDENT: Silence! Silence! There will be no further outbursts from the floor.<br>
SAREK: Mister President, I have come to speak on behalf of the accused.<br>
KLINGON AMBASSADOR: Personal bias! His son was saved by Kirk!<br>
FEDERATION PRESIDENT: Mister Ambassador, with all respect, the Council's deliberations are over.<br>
KLINGON AMBASSADOR: Then Kirk goes unpunished?<br>
FEDERATION PRESIDENT: Admiral Kirk has been charged with nine violations of Starfleet regulations.<br>
KLINGON AMBASSADOR: Starfleet regulations? That's outrageous! Remember this well. There shall be no peace as long as Kirk lives!<br>
<p>
Captain's log, stardate 8390. We are in the third month of our Vulcan exile. And it was Doctor McCoy with a fine sense of historical irony, who decided on a name for our captured Klingon vessel.<br>

SCOTT: Aye sir?<br>
KIRK: How soon can we be underway?<br>
SCOTT: Give me one more day, sir. Damage control is easy. Reading Klingon, That's hard.<br>
McCOY: You'd think they could at least send a ship. It's bad enough to be court marshalled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite, ...but to go home in this Klingon flea trap...<br>
KIRK: We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It's got a cloaking device that cost us a lot.<br>

SPOCK: I do not understand the question, Mother.<br>
AMANDA: You're half human. The computer knows that.<br>
SPOCK: The question is irrelevant.<br>
AMANDA: Spock, ...the retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.<br>
SPOCK: As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.<br>
AMANDA: Where must you go?<br>
SPOCK: I must go to Earth. To offer testimony.<br>
AMANDA: You do this ...for friendship?<br>
SPOCK: I do it because I was there,<br>
AMANDA: Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one?<br>
SPOCK: I would accept that as an axiom.<br>
AMANDA: Then you stand here alive because of a mistake ...made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the one, ...you, ...was more important to them.<br>

McCOY: Hi. ...Busy?<br>
SPOCK: Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.<br>
McCOY: Umm. Well, I just wanted to say it sure is nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine. What I mean is I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.<br>
SPOCK: My shoes.<br>
McCOY: Forget it! ...Perhaps we could cover a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life. Things of that nature?<br>
SPOCK: I did not have time on Vulcan to review the philosophical disciplines.<br>
McCOY: Come on Spock, it's me, McCoy! You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?<br>
SPOCK: It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.<br>

<p>
<b>[Bird-of-Prey bridge]</b>
<p>
UHURA: Admiral?<br>
KIRK: What is it?<br>
UHURA: Overlapping distress calls, and now a message coming in from the Federation.<br>
KIRK: On screen!<br>
FEDERATION PRESIDENT (on viewscreen): This is the President of the United Federation of Planets. Do not approach Earth!<br>
FEDERATION PRESIDENT (OC): The transmissions of an orbiting Probe are causing critical damage to this planet.<br>
FEDERATION PRESIDENT (on viewscreen): It has almost totally ionised our atmosphere.<br>
FEDERATION PRESIDENT (OC): All power sources have failed. All orbiting starships are powerless. The Probe is vaporising our oceans.<br>
FEDERATION PRESIDENT (on viewscreen): We cannot survive unless a way can be found to respond to the Probe. Further communications may not be possible<br>
FEDERATION PRESIDENT (OC): Save your energy, Save yourselves.<br>
FEDERATION PRESIDENT (on viewscreen): Avoid the Planet Earth at all costs. ...Farewell.<br>
KIRK: Uhura, let's hear the Probe's transmissions.<br>
UHURA: Yes sir. ...On speakers.<br>
KIRK: Spock? What do you make of that?<br>
SPOCK: Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great power and intelligence. Evidently unaware that its transmissions are disruptive. I find it illogical that its intentions could be hostile.<br>
McCOY: Well, dammit? You think this is its way of saying 'Hi there' to the people of the Earth?<br>
SPOCK: There are other forms on intelligence on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message must be meant for man.<br>
KIRK: You're suggesting the transmission is meant for lifeform other than man?<br>
SPOCK: It is a possibility, Admiral. The President did say that it was directed at Earth's oceans<br>
KIRK: Uhura, ...can you modify the Probe's signals accounting for density and temperature and salinity factors?<br>
UHURA: I'll try, sir. ...I think I have it.<br>
KIRK: And this is what it would sound like underwater?<br>
UHURA: Yes sir.<br>
SPOCK: Fascinating. If my suspicion is correct, there can be no response to this message.<br>
KIRK: Where are you going?<br>
SPOCK: To test my theory.<br>
KIRK: Bones, you stay here.<br>
McCOY: No way, ...somebody's gotta keep an eye on him!<br>
<p>
<b>[Bird-of-Prey computer room]</b>
<p>
KIRK: Spock?<br>
SPOCK: As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.<br>
KIRK: Whales?<br>
SPOCK: Specifically, humpback whales.<br>
McCOY: That's crazy! Who would send a Probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?<br>
KIRK: It's possible. Whales have been on Earth far earlier than man.<br>
SPOCK: Ten million years earlier. And humpbacks were heavily hunted by man. They've been extinct since the twenty-first century. It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the Probe to determine why they lost contact.<br>
McCOY: My God!<br>
KIRK: Spock, could the humpback's answer to this call be simulated?<br>
SPOCK: The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.<br>
KIRK: Does the species exist on any other planet?<br>
SPOCK: Negative. Humpbacks were indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.<br>
KIRK: Then we have no choice. We must destroy the Probe before it destroys Earth.<br>
SPOCK: To attempt to do so would be futile, Admiral. The Probe could render us neutral easily.<br>
KIRK: But we can't turn away! ...There must be an alternative?<br>
SPOCK: There is one possibility, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some humpback whales.<br>
McCOY: You just said there aren't any, except on Earth of the past.<br>
SPOCK: Yes Doctor, that's exactly what I said.<br>
McCOY: Well, in that case... Now wait just a damn minute!<br>

KIRK: Give me a round figure, Mister Scott.<br>
SCOTT: Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying cloaked. After that, Admiral, we're visible, ...and dead in the water. In any case, we won't have enough to break out of Earth's gravity, to say nothing of getting back home.<br>
KIRK: I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this! Is there no way to re-crystallise dilithium?<br>
SCOTT: Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the twenty-third century.<br>
SPOCK: Admiral, there may be a twentieth century possibility.<br>
KIRK: Explain.<br>
SPOCK: If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we may be able to find some.<br>
KIRK: I thought you said they were toxic.<br>
SPOCK: We could construct a device to collect their high-energy photons safely. These photons could then be injected into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure. ...Theoretically.<br>

<b>[Cetacean Institute]</b>
<p>
TANNOY VOICE: The next showing of 'The Wonderful World of Whales' will begin in five minutes in the marine theater.<br>
GILLIAN: Here I go. ...Good morning. I'm your guide this morning, my name is Doctor Gillian Taylor, but you can call me Gillian. I'm Assistant Director of the Maritime Cetacean Institute. So please follow me and just give a yell if you can't hear me, okay? ...The Cetacean Institute is the only museum in the world exclusively devoted to whales. As you can see we have a great deal to offer, but that is small compared to what we know, ...or rather what we don't know, about whales. The first commonly held misconception is that whales are fish. They're not, they're mammals just like you and me. Warm-blooded, needing air to breathe and producing milk to nurse their young.<br>
MAN: Do whales attack people ...like in 'Moby Dick'?<br>
GILLIAN: No. ...No, most whales don't even have teeth. They have a soft gum-like tissue that strains vast amounts of tiny shrimp for food and that is the limit of their hostility. Unfortunately, their principle enemy is far, far more aggressive.<br>
KIRK: You mean man.<br>
GILLIAN: To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. One hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, man did plenty of damage, ...but that is nothing compared to what he has achieved in this century. ...This is mankind's legacy, whales hunted to the brink of extinction. Virtually gone is the blue whale, the largest creature ever to inhabit the Earth. Despite all attempts at banning whaling, there are still countries and pirates currently engaged in the slaughter of these inoffensive creatures. Where the humpback whale once numbered in the hundreds of thousands, today there are less than ten thousand specimens alive and those that are taken are no longer fully grown. In addition, many of the females are killed, while still bearing unborn calves.<br>
SPOCK: To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.<br>
GILLIAN: Whoever said the human race was logical? ...Now if you'll follow me, please, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.<br>
<p>
<b>[Whale tank - outside]</b>
<p>
GILLIAN: This is the largest seawater tank in the world. It contains the only two humpback whales in captivity. ...They are mature humpbacks, weighing forty-five thousand pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.<br>
KIRK: It's perfect, Spock. A male and a female in a contained space. We beam them up together and consider ourselves lucky.<br>
GILLIAN: Beautiful, aren't they? And extremely intelligent. ...Now if you'll follow me please.<br>
<p>
<b>[Whale tank - inside]</b>
<p>
GILLIAN: Despite all the things that they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.<br>
KIRK: Why's that?<br>
GILLIAN: Well, for one thing, we simply don't have enough money to keep feeding them two of tons of shrimp a day!<br>
KIRK: How soon?<br>
GILLIAN: Soon. ...It's too bad because they're really quite friendly, as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them. ...And now, here's a much better way to see George and Gracie ...underwater.<br>
<p>
<b>[Whale tank - the underwater window]</b>
<p>
GILLIAN: What you're hearing is recorded whale song. It is sung by the male. He'll sing anywhere from six to as long as thirty minutes, and then, start again. In the ocean, the other whales will pick up the song, and pass it on.<br>
(Spock is seen swimming in the underwater tank)<br>
GILLIAN: The songs change every year, but we still don't know what purpose they serve. Are they some kind of navigational signal? Could they be part of the mating ritual? Or is it pure communication beyond our comprehension? Frankly we just don't know<br>
OLDER WOMAN: Maybe he's singing to that man.<br>

SPOCK: Most kind.<br>
SAREK: As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet. ...It is possible that judgment was incorrect. ...Your associates are people of good character.<br>

SAREK: Yes, of course. ...Do you have a message for your mother?<br>
