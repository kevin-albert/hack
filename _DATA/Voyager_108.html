48623.5. There are two hundred forty six elements known to Federation
science. We believe we have just discovered the two hundred forty
seventh inside the ring system of a Class D planet. </font>

(Gathered around the Science station.) <br>
KIM: The element has an unusually large atomic mass, over five hundred
and fifty nucleons. And the readings are constant. The element appears
to be stable.<br>
JANEWAY: A stable transuranic element inside a natural environment.
This is a first.<br>
TORRES: Can you imagine what we could make with this stuff? Probe
casings that could go into the core of a sun, ultra-thin reactor
shielding.<br>
JANEWAY: That's assuming we can mine it. Ensign, try and locate the
highest concentration of the element.<br>
KIM: The element is present in most of the asteroids that comprise the
rings. I can isolate a sample and beam it aboard.<br>
TORRES: Or better yet, maybe we could get a firsthand look at this
element in its natural environment. It looks like most of these
asteroids support Class M atmospheres.<br>
JANEWAY: Good idea. Commander, you're in charge.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. Mister Kim, would you like to join us?<br>
KIM: I wouldn't miss it, sir. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Asteroid

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
The highest concentration is about thirty metres directly ahead.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm picking up a large cavern in there. The readings are <br>

CHAKOTAY: What the hell is this?<br>
TORRES: It's organic. Some kind of biopolymer residue.<br>

The readings are higher over here, but I still can't find the source of

(They move onto a ledge overlooking a large area where there are more
cobweb covered shapes, then go down to investigate more closely.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, there are eighteen bodies here, all humanoid. Eleven
male, seven female. From what we can tell they're in various stages of
decomposition. Some have been here for years. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Others no longer than a few days. In fact, one body
arrived less than twelve hours ago.<br>

CHAKOTAY [OC]: I don't know, Captain. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Cavern]</b>

CHAKOTAY: But from the position of the arms, I'd say we're looking at
some kind of burial site. </font></p>

JANEWAY: What about the element we discovered? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Cavern]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
It's emanating from their bodies, Captain. We think it's some kind of </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES
[OC]: By-product of their decomposition process.<br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: I recommend we leave these bodies in peace, Captain. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Cavern]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
CHAKOTAY: However, Mister Kim has a different opinion.<br>
KIM: With all due respect, Captain, I have to disagree with the
Commander. This is our first contact with this race, and I think we
should be learning all we can about them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM
[OC]: It's a unique anthropological opportunity.<br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: I understand the chance for scientific discovery,
Captain </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Cavern]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
CHAKOTAY: But whatever belief this race has, they clearly meant for
their dead to be left alone and I think we should respect that. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: I'm afraid I agree with Commander Chakotay. Set your
tricorders for passive scans. I don't want to disturb anything. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Captain </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Cavern]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
CHAKOTAY: The sanctity of these bodies should be respected. I recommend
we make visual observations only. No tricorders. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Very well. Keep me informed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Cavern]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> JANEWAY
[OC]: Janeway out.<br>
CHAKOTAY: All right. The only sensors you have left are your eyes.
Concentrate on details. We're going to have to do a thorough report
when we get back.<br>
KIM: Commander, thanks for letting me voice my opinion to the Captain.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I remember the first time I went on a tomb excavation on
Ktaria Seven. I wanted to keep a memento of the experience, so I picked
up a rock from the burial site. Only I found out later it wasn't just a
rock.<br>
KIM: What was it?<br>
CHAKOTAY: It was a sacred stone. The Ktarians lay thousands of them in
the tomb. Each one represents a special prayer. Without realising it, I
had desecrated that man's grave.<br>
TORRES: Well, I think I've found out about all I can with my eyes.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Really? What have you learned about this culture so far?<br>
TORRES: They like to bury their dead on asteroids. That's about all I
can tell without a tricorder. No artefacts, no inscriptions, just some
naked dead people.<br>
CHAKOTAY: You're looking but you're not seeing. The fact that they're
naked says a lot. It means this race doesn't believe in dressing the
deceased. And the lack of artefacts could indicate they don't believe
any worldly goods can be taken into the afterlife.<br>
KIM: What makes you think they believe in an afterlife at all?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Look at the position of the arms and hands. The bodies have
been arranged in poses of serenity, and they appear to be wrapped in
the same biopolymer residue we found out in the passageway, all
indications that this culture has a great deal of ritual associated
with disposing of the dead. That normally indicates some belief in the
afterlife.<br>
TORRES: The Klingons believe in an afterlife, but there's no burial
ritual. They just dispose of the corpse by the most efficient means
possible.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Good point. However, some archaeological digs on the Klingon
Homeworld <br>
(There is a sound like a wind, then a light appears above them.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tricorders!<br>
KIM: A dimensional distortion is forming. Some kind of subspace vacuole.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Voyager. Emergency beam-out.<br>

He was pulled into the vacuole.<br>
TORRES: This isn't one of the bodies we found in the cavern. It's
someone else.<br>
CHAKOTAY: This body might have come out of the vacuole at the same time
Kim was taken in.<br>
TORRES: Wait a minute. I'm showing signs of electrical activity in the
brain. It looks like she died just a few minutes ago. We might be able
to revive her. If we can, we might get some answers.<br>
CHAKOTAY: We can't interfere with this woman's natural process of death.<br>
TORRES: What do you suggest we do, Commander? Kim's gone. She's the
only one who might be able to tell us what happened.<br>

a new journey. Ptera will now thrive in the Next Emanation. This is

LORIA: Here it is.<br>
HATIL: Thanks. A lot of memories in this.<br>
LORIA: We're so proud of you, Hatil. This is such a generous, selfless
act.<br>
HATIL: It's my last gift for you and the children.<br>
LORIA: And it's one we will always cherish. But I'm still going to miss
you.<br>
HATIL: I know. I'll miss you too. But I'll see you in the Next
Emanation when you're ready to join me.<br>

planted have, have been in bloom for three years straight.<br>

adjoining cubicle.) <br>
RENORA: Lie down. It's going to be all right. We won't harm you.<br>
HATIL: Who is that?<br>
RENORA: We're not sure yet. We think he came from the Next Emanation.<br>
HATIL: The Next Emanation? You mean he's come back?<br>
KIM: Come back from where?<br>
RENORA: We've called for the thanatologist. He'll be here any moment. I
don't think there should be any further discussion about this until he
arrives.<br>
(Renora leaves.) <br>
HATIL: How did you get here?<br>
KIM: I'm not sure. I just sort of woke up inside one of those pods. I
was conducting an investigation on an asteroid, we found some dead
bodies, then there was some kind of subspace phenomenon.<br>
HATIL: What do you mean, you saw dead people there?<br>
(The door opens.) <br>
NERIA: I'm Doctor Neria, the chief thanatologist of this facility.<br>
KIM: Ensign Harry Kim of the Federation starship Voyager.<br>
NERIA: I see. What race are you from?<br>
KIM: We call ourselves human. We come from a planet called Earth in a
distant part of the galaxy.<br>
HATIL: He said he saw dead people on an asteroid.<br>
NERIA: Dead?<br>
KIM: Look, can you tell me where I am?<br>
HATIL: Doctor, what does this mean?<br>
NERIA: Rest, Hatil. There's no need for concern. May I speak to you
privately, Ensign Harry?<br>
KIM: Just Harry's fine.<br>
NERIA: We are the Vhnori and this is our homeworld.<br>
KIM: We were investigating one of the asteroids in the rings around
your planet.<br>
NERIA: There are no rings around our world.<br>
KIM: So the subspace vacuole must have transported me somewhere else.
Do you have any star charts I could look at? I'd like to figure out
where I am now in relation to where I was.<br>
NERIA: Where you are now is in the world of the living. Where you came
from was another dimension.<br>
KIM: Another dimension?<br>
NERIA: Yes. You returned from the Next Emanation. The afterlife. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: How were you able to revive her?<br>
EMH: It's a simple process, really. She died of a cancerous growth on
the brain stem. I removed the tumour, replicated new neural tissue and
used the standard Starfleet postmortem resuscitation technique for a
class five life form.<br>
JANEWAY: Why was she covered with this biopolymer?<br>
EMH: She wasn't covered with it, exactly. The biopolymer is a
by-product of her own tissues.<br>
JANEWAY: Explain.<br>
EMH: As her tissues decayed, the cell membranes broke down into a
biopolymer resin which was then excreted by her epidermal layer. My
guess is it's a natural decomposition process for this species.<br>
CHAKOTAY: So the other biopolymer fibres we found in the cavern were <br>
EMH: Were probably the result of other bodies that had decomposed and
left a residual membrane. In essence, Commander, you were strolling
through dead bodies.<br>
JANEWAY: Can you wake her?<br>
EMH: Yes, of course. Kes, two cc's of netinaline. <br>
(Kes gives the EMH the hypo and he administers it.) <br>
EMH: Hello.<br>
JANEWAY: I know this must be very confusing for you, but you're all
right. My name is Kathryn Janeway.<br>
PTERA: I'm Ptera. Where's my brother?<br>
JANEWAY: Your brother? I'm afraid he's not here.<br>
PTERA: But he's supposed to be here. They're all supposed to be here.<br>
JANEWAY: Ptera, we were able to remove the tumour from your brain.
You're going to be all right. We revived you because one of our<br>
PTERA: This is the Next Emanation? This is the afterlife?<br>
JANEWAY: No. No, it's not. You're on a starship.<br>
PTERA: This can't be right. My brother's supposed to be here.
Something's wrong.<br>
JANEWAY: Let me explain.<br>
PTERA: No. No! Get away from me. This isn't right. This can't be right!

room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
You're saying there was a woman in here just before I arrived?<br>
NERIA: That's right. Her name was Ptera. She was dying of a tumourous
lesion to her midbrain.<br>
KIM: Dying. So she wasn't dead yet?<br>
NERIA: No, of course not. She didn't die until the cenotaph was
activated. That's the purpose of the cenotaph. It terminates a person's
life just before the appearance of a spectral rupture and then it
allows their body to be taken to the Next Emanation.<br>
KIM: Spectral rupture.<br>
NERIA: Well, I can show you.<br>
(Neria calls up a schematic on a monitor.) <br>
KIM: This looks like what we would call a subspace vacuole. Does the
cenotaph create these ruptures?<br>
NERIA: No, they're natural occurrences, once every six hours. This
entire complex was built on this site because a spectral rupture occurs
here. There are thousands of such sites on our world. Forgive my
curiosity, Harry, but, you are the first person ever to come back from
the afterlife. I have quite a few questions. You said that you saw dead
bodies?<br>
KIM: That's right. There were seven females, eleven males. Some of the
bodies had been there for years, others just for a few days.<br>
NERIA: Are you saying that when we die we go to some asteroid and
decompose?<br>
KIM: Well, that's what it looked liked to us.<br>
NERIA: These bodies, did you perform any kind of bioscans on them? Was
there any specific medical data that you can remember?<br>
KIM: Doctor, maybe I should just stop right there. This is what my
people call a first contact situation, and we've learned to be very
careful about how much we tell alien cultures we've just met. <br>
NERIA: I would like to start a complete bioanalysis as soon as
possible. If you'll just follow Doctor Renora.<br>
KIM: Bioanalysis? Look, all I want to do is get back to my ship. And I
think there might be a way to use this spectral rupture of yours to <br>
NERIA: You're not going anywhere. You are our first glimpse into what
lies beyond death. We are not going to let this opportunity pass us by.

CHAKOTAY: We've completed our analysis of the ring system. Our sensors
have detected over two hundred thousand alien bodies on various
asteroids in the rings. From what we can tell, a subspace vacuole
appears about every two hours, deposits a body and then disappears.<br>
JANEWAY: We need to focus on those vacuoles. Concentrate on trying to
probe them with a high resolution subspace scans. See if you can find
any sign of Mister Kim.<br>

That's, that's all I know. I'm sorry. I can't tell you anything more.<br>

what might have happened to Mister Kim. Is there anything I can do for
you?<br>
PTERA: Well, I'd, I'd like some answers.<br>
JANEWAY: About what?<br>
PTERA: About what happens to my people when we die.<br>
JANEWAY: We're not sure exactly. But from what we do know, the vacuoles
deposit the bodies on the asteroids in this ring system.<br>
PTERA: And then what?<br>
JANEWAY: I'm not sure what you mean.<br>
PTERA: We're supposed to evolve into a higher level of consciousness
when we die. We're supposed to gain a greater understanding of the
universe. All of our questions are supposed to be answered.<br>
JANEWAY: Ptera, I know this must be frightening for you. You've been
through a very traumatic experience. It would frighten me. But please
try to understand. Just because I don't have the answers to your
questions doesn't mean there aren't any.<br>
PTERA: My brother. I always thought I'd see him again. I had so many
things to tell him about his children, the people he left behind. But
he isn't here, is he? He's. So, what am I supposed to do now, spend the
rest of my life on this, this starship?<br>
JANEWAY: Ptera, I am going to do everything in my power to figure out
just how you got here. And as soon as I know anything, I will tell you,
all right?<br>
PTERA: All right.<br>
KES: Maybe we should get out of Sickbay, let you walk around for a
while, clear your mind. Maybe get something to eat. Are you hungry?<br>

LORIA: I don't understand.<br>
HATIL: Neither do I. It's just that I'm starting to wonder what really
happens when we die, if I'm really going on to a higher level of
consciousness.<br>
LORIA: The alien. What has he been telling you?<br>
HATIL: All he's done is made me stop and think about something we've
always taken for granted, and now that I've thought about it, I'm not
so eager to go through with it anymore.<br>
LORIA: Hatil, we know nothing about him, or why he's come here, or why
he's spreading lies about the Next Emanation. All I know is, you can't
throw away a lifetime of belief because of him. It doesn't make sense.<br>
HATIL: I don't know what to think anymore. I'm scared, Loria.<br>

HATIL: Harry, you have to forgive my wife. She's having trouble
understanding my concerns about the afterlife. That's why I'm here. I'm
getting ready to die. Forgive me for asking again but can you tell me
anything about what I might find in the Next Emanation?<br>
KIM: Everyone keeps asking me that, and I just keep giving the same
answer. I don't know.<br>
HATIL: But you do come from the afterlife?<br>
KIM: I come from a different reality, maybe another dimension. Maybe it
is your afterlife. I don't know. All I do know is that there are
countless billions of people there who are born, live and die, just
like you do here.<br>
HATIL: But you did see my people there? You said they were dead?<br>
KIM: Yes, but, look, for all I know, your thanatologists are right, and
all I saw were the corporeal remains of your people, and you do go on
to a higher consciousness.<br>
HATIL: But it's also possible that there is no higher existence for us,
that when we die we simply cease to exist.<br>
KIM: I, I really can't say. I don't know what happens to your people
after they die. I don't even know what happens to my people after they
die.<br>
HATIL: Don't you have thanatologists, people who study death?<br>
KIM: Well, sort of. There have certainly been medical experts,
philosophers, theologians who have spent a great deal of time debating
what happens after death. But no one's come up with an answer yet.<br>
HATIL: My people have come to think of death as just another stage of
our existence. There are some people who are even eager to die. If they
feel depressed or lonely in this life, they simply move on to the next
one.<br>
KIM: Is that why you're here? Because you're not happy with your life?<br>
HATIL: Ever since the er, accident, life hasn't been easy. But I have
to say, this is more my family's idea than it is mine.<br>
KIM: Your family?<br>
HATIL: I'm a burden to them right now. It takes a lot of their time and
resources to care for me, and I can't give much back to them. So, there
was a family meeting and it was agreed that I should move on to the
Next Emanation. You look appalled.<br>
KIM: It's not my place to judge your culture, but from my perspective,
it's a little chilling to hear that.<br>
HATIL: Even though the family did it out of love, and everyone was
happy for me, and they said they'd see me when they got to the Next
Emanation, I have to admit there is a little voice inside of me that is
terrified of dying. And since I've been talking to you, that little
voice has started to get louder. </font></p>

JANEWAY: I'm reading another vacuole forming on the ship. Tuvok, try
remodulating the shield harmonics.<br>
TUVOK: It's no use, Captain. The vacuole is still forming. <br>
(Whumph! A body appears on the catwalk.) <br>
TUVOK: Take the body to the ship's morgue.<br>
JANEWAY: This is odd. Three bodies have appeared on Voyager so far, and
each one of them has released some kind of neural energy. In every
case, the energy has passed through the hull and out into the rings.
The energy's frequency is identical to the ambient radiation in the
asteroid field.<br>
(Whumph!) <br>
TORRES: The vacuoles are disrupting the warp core's magnetic
interlocks. It won't be long before we lose antimatter containment.<br>
JANEWAY: The vacuoles have all formed within twenty metres of the warp
core. They might be attracted to it. Janeway to Bridge. Mister Paris,
lay in a course. I want to get </font></p>

Sometimes I come in here and just stare out at the stars for hours. I
never get tired of looking at them.<br>
PTERA: We were always told we would see beautiful sights in the Next
Emanation. Colours, lights, and that we would see them with new eyes
and a new understanding. But now. What happened to the others? My
brother, my father and everyone before them? People die every day on my
world. Do they all end up as lifeless corpses?<br>
KES: When people die on my world, we bury them beneath the soil, and we
believe that their comra is released into the afterlife.<br>
PTERA: Their comra?<br>
KES: Our soul, our spirit, the essence of our beings. Maybe something
similar happens to you.<br>
PTERA: But you don't understand. We don't believe in any kind of
spirit. When we die, we're supposed to reappear as physical beings with
arms and legs. That's the whole point of sending our people through the
spectral ruptures. We're supposed to travel on to the Next Emanation as
ourselves and be reunited with our families. But none of that is true,
is it? None of the people I love are here. I'm alone. I don't belong
here. I can't live like this. Please, can't you send me home?<br>

that question. </font></p>

JANEWAY: We're doing everything we can to get you back home, Ptera.
Once we locate our missing officer, we're hoping he might be able to
tell us enough to<br>
TORRES: Wait a minute, Captain. Maybe there is a way to send Ptera home
and find Ensign Kim at the same time.<br>
JANEWAY: Explain.<br>
TORRES: What if we recreated the transporter accident? If it's true
that Harry was pulled through the vacuole during transport, we might be
able to reproduce those circumstances and send Ptera home.<br>
CHAKOTAY: We could send Ptera through the subspace transponder and hope
the signal will penetrate the dimensional barrier and allow us to lock
on to Kim with the transporter beam.<br>
TORRES: Right.<br>
PTERA: So I can get home?<br>
JANEWAY: Ptera, you should know that there's no guarantee this is going
to work.<br>
PTERA: I understand the risk, but I've already been dead once and I'm
prepared to die again if necessary. So if there's a chance I can get
home, I'm willing to take the risk.<br>
JANEWAY: All right. Commander, prepare a subspace transponder and teach
Ptera how to use it.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. </font></p>

Captain's log, supplemental. We've returned to the ring system, and
we're preparing to send Ptera back to her dimension. Lieutenant Torres

SESKA: I see the vacuole. Locking on.<br>
JANEWAY: Good luck, Ptera.<br>
SESKA: I have a transporter lock. Energising. Matching her pattern to
the subspace distortions. Wait a minute. The vacuole is shutting down.
I can't get her pattern through.<br>
JANEWAY: Abort the procedure. Pull her back.<br>
SESKA: I'm trying. I'm losing her pattern.<br>
JANEWAY: Shunt emergency power into buffer tank four.<br>

catches her as she falls.) <br>

JANEWAY: Is there any brain activity? Can we revive her? Janeway to
Lieutenant Torres. How long until we have to leave?<br>
TORRES [OC]: I'd say we're safe for another two hours.<br>
JANEWAY: That gives us two hours to find Mister Kim. We'll have to stay
within high-range scanner range. Perform another subspace scan. This
time extend the scan radius to ten AU. I'm on my way to Engineering.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
Why?<br>
NERIA: We want to make a more detailed scan of your microcellular
structures and a complete examination of your neurochemistry. This
facility isn't equipped for such a detailed bioanalysis. The complex at
Paffran has everything we need.<br>
KIM: Look. If my ship is still searching for me, they're not going to
stay there forever. I have to get back.<br>
NERIA: That's not possible. We don't even understand how you got here.<br>
KIM: Then maybe I can figure out a way to get back. Let me take a look
at one of those cenotaphs.<br>
NERIA: There's no time for that. Word about you has spread very
quickly, Harry, not only in the scientific world, but in the community
at large. There are many people who are very nervous about what you
represent. Some even see you as a threat to their beliefs about the
afterlife. We need to take you to a more secure location. It's for your
own protection.<br>
KIM: Wait!<br>
NERIA: I'm sorry, Harry. It's out of my control.<br>
(Neria leaves. Kim turns to Hatil, who is wrapping himself in mummy
bandages.) <br>
KIM: What are you doing?<br>
HATIL: Preparing for the transference ritual. This is a ceremonial
shroud that's been in my family for five generations.<br>
KIM: So they make you wrap yourself in your own death shroud. <br>
HATIL: It's something we look forward to, actually. I remember when my
father used this shroud, his father before him. The difference is, when
my father put this on there was no doubt in his mind about where he was
going.<br>
KIM: Can't you just back out? Say you've changed your mind.<br>
HATIL: I have thought of just walking out and disappearing. I have some
friends in the Cararian Mountains. They would be willing to let me stay
with them. But my family would worry about me. They'd wonder what was
happening, if I was all right, if I were hurt. No, everyone's expecting
a transference ritual, and I'm going to give them one.<br>
KIM: What if you did disappear into the mountains, but your family
thought you were dead? I mean, they're here for a transference ritual,
right?<br>
HATIL: Do you realise what you're suggesting?<br>
KIM: It's perfect. Those cenotaphs send your people back to my
dimension, which is where I want to go. Voyager's probably still near
the asteroid searching for me. As soon as I appear, they'll pick up my
signal and beam me aboard. And you, you can just disappear. Your family
will think you're dead, and you can live out your life in the mountains.<br>
HATIL: Harry, if you go into that cenotaph and go through with the
transference ritual, you'll die.<br>
KIM: Well, if Voyager can beam me aboard quickly enough, our doctor
should be able to revive me. Medicine's pretty advanced in our culture.
I've heard of cases where people have been dead for hours and still
been brought back to life.<br>
HATIL: But it's not certain?<br>
KIM: No, it's not, but I think this is my only chance to get home.<br>
HATIL: The shroud has to be wrapped in a particular way. I'll show you
how, but we have to hurry. I'm scheduled for transference in less than
an hour. </font></p>

lowered.) <br>
NERIA: We're joined here today to bid farewell to our dear friend Hatil
Garan. We salute not only his life, but the manner in which he has
chosen to end it. He makes a noble sacrifice today that his family may
have a better tomorrow. We prepare to send him on to the Next Emanation

KIM: Better. I'll be ready for duty tomorrow morning.<br>
JANEWAY: You're off duty for the next two days.<br>
KIM: Captain, I'm fine.<br>
JANEWAY: It's not a reflection on your capabilities, Ensign. I just
want to give you a chance to reflect on what's happened. This may not
make much sense to you now, a young man at the beginning of his career,
but one of the things you'll learn as you move up the ranks and get a
little older is that you wish you had more time in your youth to really
absorb all the things that happened to you. It goes by so fast. It's so
easy to become jaded, to treat the extraordinary like just another day
at the office, but sometimes there are experiences which transcend all
that. You've just had one, Mister Kim, and I want you to live with it
for a little while. Write about it, if you feel like it. Paint. Express
yourself in some fashion. The Bridge will still be there in two days.<br>
KIM: Thank you, Captain. I have been a little preoccupied with the
experience. I mean, all those people think that they know what happens
after death. They look forward to it. They're prepared for it. But the
truth is, none of it's real. They don't have an afterlife. They just
decay inside those asteroids.<br>
JANEWAY: I wouldn't be so sure of that, if I were you. That neural
energy their bodies release, it becomes part of the ambient
electromagnetic field surrounding the planet. Our readings also
indicate the energy's unusually dynamic. There's a great deal of
variation and pattern complexity, quantum density.<br>
KIM: Are you saying you think they do have an afterlife? That the
energy field is where they exist at a higher level of consciousness,
just like they believe?<br>
JANEWAY: I'm not certain, but I am certain about this. What we don't
know about death is far, far greater than what we do know. See you in
two days, Ensign.<br>
KIM: Thank you, Captain. </font> </p>
