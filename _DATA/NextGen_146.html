RIKER: Looking good. I'll go five. <br>
PULASKI: Five here. <br>
LAFORGE: And five more. <br>
DATA: I believe the wiser course of action here is to bend. <br>
LAFORGE: You mean fold, Data. <br>
DATA: That is correct. Fold. To bend. To make compact or to capitulate.
<br>
WORF: I raise fifty. <br>
DATA: I do not believe Lieutenant Worf understands all the nuances of
this betting procedure. <br>
RIKER: I wouldn't be so quick to judge, Data. His pile's a lot bigger
than yours. <br>
PULASKI: Than any of ours. <br>
DATA: The cards have been favouring the Lieutenant, but that is the
result of random chance, therefore, a temporary condition. <br>
LAFORGE: You hope. <br>
WORF: Talk or play. Not both. <br>
RIKER: Fifty, right? <br>
PULASKI: Fifty is the bet. What's the matter? Feet getting cold? <br>
RIKER: My cards are getting cold. Here you go. <br>
PULASKI: I'm glad you stayed in. I need the chips. <br>
LAFORGE: Talk, talk, talk <br>
PULASKI: Okay, here's the action. Fifty, and another fifty. <br>
LAFORGE: Ouch. Fold, fold, fold <br>
WORF: Your fifty, and fifty more. <br>
RIKER: Love to play, but not with these cards. <br>
PULASKI: Looks like it's just us, handsome. I'll see you. <br>
(Worf puts down three aces and two queens) <br>
PULASKI: Beats my straight. <br>
RIKER: The Iceman wins again. <br>
PULASKI: You took my last chip. You could at least smile, Worf. <br>
LAFORGE: Smiling would break his concentration. <br>
WORF: Your deal. <br>
DATA: (shuffles) Geordi. <br>
(Geordi cuts the pack) <br>
DATA: The game is seven card stud. After the queen, one-eyed jacks and
low card in the hole are wild. <br>
LAFORGE: Wait a minute, let me write this down. <br>
((Everyone gets two hole cards and one face up) <br>
WORF: I open with fifty. <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: Bridge to Commander Riker. We're receiving a class eleven
emergency signal from Starfleet Command. <br>
RIKER: On my way. <br>
LAFORGE: Fifty? You were bluffing. <br>
WORF: Klingons never bluff. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, right. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Mister Data? <br>
DATA: Emergency signal reads as follows. Enterprise to divert to
coordinates four-two-three by one one two by five one immediately.
Further orders forthcoming. <br>
RIKER: That's it? What's the emergency? <br>
DATA: The message does not elaborate. <br>
RIKER: You'd think they'd at least give us a hint. <br>
CLANCEY: Course laid in, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Warp eight. Whenever Starfleet gets enigmatic, I know we're
about to face a challenge. Engage. <br>
DATA: Our destination is a point near the Boradis system. <br>
PICARD: That area was colonized fairly recently, as I recall. <br>
DATA: The first Federation outpost was established thirty four years
ago on Boradis Three. <br>
RIKER: Since then, the Federation has colonised several planets in that
sector. <br>
DATA: Yet we are not headed for a specific colony. The coordinates
given are outside the Boradis system. <br>
PICARD: Any problems reported in that area? <br>
DATA: None, sir. <br>
PICARD: What the devil is going on? <br>
WORF: Captain, Starfleet Command is hailing us. <br>
PICARD: About time. On screen. <br>
(a woman in Starfleet uniform is sitting behind a desk) <br>
GROMEK [on viewscreen]: Greetings, Captain Picard. <br>
PICARD: My compliments, Admiral Gromek. <br>
GROMEK [on viewscreen]: Captain, you will soon be joined by a
Federation special emissary from Starbase One Five Three. We Are now
transmitting the specifics. <br>
DATA: We are receiving, sir. <br>
GROMEK [on viewscreen]: The rendezvous will be a bit tricky, so it is
imperative you reach the intercept point on schedule. <br>
PICARD: Understood. And the mission? <br>
GROMEK [on viewscreen]: The envoy will fill you in. You are to
cooperate fully. <br>
PICARD: Admiral, can you give me any details? <br>
GROMEK [on viewscreen]: Negative. <br>
PICARD: Admiral, it's a little difficult to prepare for a mission I
know nothing about. <br>
GROMEK [on viewscreen]: I sympathise, Jean-Luc, but Starfleet Command
considers this a top security matter. Once the envoy has briefed you, I
think you will understand our caution. Gromek out. <br>
RIKER: Data, what ship is carrying the envoy? <br>
DATA: Apparently there were no starships available on Starbase One Five
Three. The envoy is aboard a class eight probe. <br>
RIKER: A class eight probe is just over two metres long. <br>
PICARD: Yes, that's true, Number One. But if the transmitters and the
sensors were removed and life-support installed, there would be just
enough room for one person. <br>
RIKER: And it is designed to travel at warp nine. <br>
DATA: By sending the probe to meet us rather than diverting the
Enterprise, they are saving us six point one hours. <br>
PICARD: Obviously Starfleet feels that time is of the essence. <br>
RIKER: But still, to seal someone inside a class eight Probe and launch
it off. It's a hell of a way to transport a Federation dignitary. <br>
CLANCEY: (an elegant brunette with cut glass vowels) Coming to three
one mark one one three.
i<br>
DATA: We are on a course precisely parallel to the probe, sir. <br>
PICARD: Increase speed to warp eight point nine. <br>
CLANCEY: Eight point nine, aye. <br>
PICARD: Full sensors aft. <br>
WORF: Scanning. <br>
RIKER: Data, if we project our course beyond the rendezvous
coordinates, what lies ahead? <br>
DATA: As far as I can determine, sir, very little. There are four
colonies in the
Boradis system, as well as nine other outposts scattered throughout the
sector. <br>
WORF: I have it, sir. Bearing zero five mark two three one. Velocity,
warp nine. <br>
CLANCEY: I see it. <br>
PICARD: Adjust speed to intercept. <br>
WORF: Probe is coming up to starboard. Range, eighty two hundred.

K'EHLEYR: You speak Klingon. <br>
RIKER: A little. I am Commander William Riker. This is Chief Medical
Officer Katherine Pulaski. I hope your voyage wasn't too unpleasant. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Klingons are not supposed to mind hardship. Nonetheless, I am
delighted to be out of that damned coffin. <br>
RIKER: I don't blame you. It's not the most luxurious accommodation
Starfleet has to offer. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Whoever said that getting there was half the fun never rode
in a class eight probe. <br>
PULASKI: How are you feeling? Your vital signs are rather atypical for
a Klingon. <br>
K'EHLEYR: No doubt because I am only half Klingon. <br>
PULASKI: Oh? <br>
K'EHLEYR: Yes. My father was Klingon. My mother was human. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Captain, allow me to present Special
Federation Emissary K'Ehleyr. <br>
PICARD: Welcome aboard. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. This is Counsellor Troi,
Lieutenant Commander Data, and this is Lieutenant <br>
K'EHLEYR: Worf. So this is where you've been hiding. I told you we'd
meet again. Aren't you going to greet me? <br>
WORF: I have nothing to say to you. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Haven't changed a bit. Well, I missed you, too. Two days ago,
Starbase Three Three Six received an automated transmission from a
Klingon ship, the T'Ong.
That ship was sent out over seventy five years ago. <br>
RIKER: When the Federation and the Klingon Empire were still at war. <br>
K'EHLEYR: The message was directed to the Klingon High Command. It said
only that the ship was returning home and was about to reach its
awakening point. <br>
PICARD: Which suggests that the crew had been in cryogenic sleep for
that long journey. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Exactly. <br>
RIKER: And when this crew is revived? <br>
K'EHLEYR: We'll have a ship full of Klingons who think the war is still
going on. <br>
PICARD: So our task is to find the ship, and tell the Klingons they're
no longer at war. <br>
RIKER: Why us? Wouldn't a Klingon ship be a better choice? <br>
K'EHLEYR: A Klingon ship, the P'rang, is on its way, but it's two days
behind us. That may be too late. <br>
TROI: Why too late? <br>
RIKER: When the T'Ong crew awakens it will be within striking range of
several Federation outposts. <br>
DATA: There are thirteen colonies with minimal defences in that sector.
<br>
K'EHLEYR: Nice, ripe targets for a Klingon warship. <br>
TROI: And you believe you can convince these Klingons that the humans
are now their allies? <br>
K'EHLEYR: No, not a chance. If you ask me, talking will be a waste of
time. Klingons of that era were raised to despise humans. We'll try
diplomacy. But I promise you it won't work. And then you'll have to
destroy them. <br>
PICARD: No. <br>
K'EHLEYR: No. Captain, these Klingons are killers. You'll have no
choice. <br>
PICARD: We shall find another choice. I want options and I want them
before we encounter the Klingon ship. Lieutenant, I'm assigning you to
help the Emissary. Dismissed. <br>
TROI: I will escort you to the guest quarters. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Captain. <br>
(All leave except Picard and Worf) <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant? <br>
WORF: Sir. I suggest Commander Riker or Data would better serve Special
Emissary K'Ehleyr. <br>
PICARD: Are there any personal reasons you don't want the assignment? <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
PICARD: Any professional reasons? <br>
WORF: No. (Picard's left eyebrow raises slightly) I withdraw my
request, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Good.

a Klingon to produce a child. <br>

Rather like my parents. <br>
TROI: I know exactly what you mean. My father was human and my mother
is a Betazoid. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Really? It was the other way around for me. My mother was
human. You must've grown up like I did, trapped between cultures. <br>
TROI: I never felt trapped. I tried to experience the richness and
diversity of the two worlds. <br>

It's gotten me into plenty of trouble. <br>
TROI: And your Klingon side? <br>
K'EHLEYR: That, I keep under tight control. It's like a terrible
temper. It's not something I want people to see. <br>
TROI: Everyone has tempers. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Not like mine. Sometimes I feel there's a monster inside of
me, fighting to get out. <br>
TROI: And it frightens you. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Of course it does. My Klingon side can be terrifying, even to
me. <br>

WORF: I never? <br>
K'EHLEYR: I mean, as I see it, we have some unfinished business, you
and I. <br>
WORF: Not as far as I'm concerned. According to the library computer,
the captain of the T'Ong is K'Temoc. But there is nothing regarding the
ship's mission. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Probably some secret military objective. <br>
WORF: Perhaps, but we have no evidence of that. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Why else would there be no record of the mission? <br>
WORF: The records may simply have been lost. <br>
K'EHLEYR: What does it matter? Our concern is the present, the possible
threat. <br>
WORF: And to contend with that threat, we need information. <br>
K'EHLEYR: We have all the information we need. <br>
WORF: That is foolish. Knowing their mission might help us understand
them. <br>
K'EHLEYR: There is nothing to understand. These are Klingons. They'll
attack. In their minds, we're the enemy, and there's no way we're going
to talk them out of that! <br>
WORF: And I do not appreciate being interrupted. <br>
K'EHLEYR: And I do not appreciate wasting my time. <br>
WORF: We were instructed to come up with options. <br>
K'EHLEYR: There aren't any. The assignment's hopeless. <br>
WORF: There are always options. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Oh, are there? Tell me, whatever happened to that wonderful
Klingon fatalism of yours? <br>
WORF: My experiences aboard this ship have taught me that most problems
have more than one solution. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Starfleet hasn't improved you one bit. You're as stubborn as
ever. <br>
WORF: Are you going to carry out your duties, or aren't you? <br>
K'EHLEYR: All right, I will. Upon due consideration of the problem and
careful examination of all possible options, my original recommendation
stands. Meeting adjourned.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">K'EHLEYR: We find the ship before it reaches the
awakening point. In that case, we simply keep the crew asleep. <br>
PICARD: Is that feasible? <br>
LAFORGE: We can beam an away team onto the T'Ong and override the
cryogenic controls, sure. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Then we await the arrival of the Klingon ship P'rang. <br>
TROI: So that when the T'Ong's crew awakens, they're surrounded by
their fellow Klingons. <br>
RIKER: That would be ideal. <br>
K'EHLEYR: But there's the second possibility. That the crew of the
T'Ong has already revived. <br>
LAFORGE: They realise they're in Federation territory and attack the
nearest outpost. <br>
TROI: They could have been on a scientific voyage. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Klingons of that ear doing research for its own sake? <br>
RIKER: The point is, they may be reasonable. <br>
K'EHLEYR: The point is that this is beside the point. These are
Klingons, at war with us. Whatever their mission was, once they see a
Federation target, they'll attack. <br>
PICARD: Could the T'Ong be disabled rather than destroyed? <br>
LAFORGE: We could probably knock out their warp drive engines without
damaging the rest of their ship. <br>
K'EHLEYR: That would gain you nothing. Disable the ship, and K'Temoc
will destroy it himself. <br>
WORF: Klingons do not surrender. <br>
K'EHLEYR: If we don't reach the T'Ong before its crew wakes up, you
have no alternatives. <br>
PICARD: I can't not accept that. There must be some way that we can
make the Klingons listen. If we can only convince them <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: Shields are up. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Better lock in phasers. This may be the only chance you get. <br>
CLANCEY: Intercept course laid in. <br>
PICARD: Hold this position. Let's see if they've spotted us.
Magnification, one hundred. Mister Data? <br>
DATA: Sensors show life forms aboard, but I am unable to ascertain
whether they are awake or dormant. However, the vessel's propulsion
systems are inactive, so I would hypothesize that the crew is asleep. <br>
(So they get shot at) <br>
DATA: However, I could be in error. <br>
WORF: Shields holding. <br>
RIKER: They've cloaked themselves. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Well, Captain you've had your chance. <br>
(a few minutes later, La Forge enters) <br>
LAFORGE: Transferring Engineering to the Bridge. <br>
PICARD: Can you find them? <br>
LAFORGE: I think so. Those old shields weren't particularly efficient
at blocking gamma ray output. If I can tune the sensors to a particular
band of. There. Got them. Transferring coordinates to helm. <br>
PICARD: Intercept. Warp two. <br>
CLANCEY: Warp two, sir. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Captain let them die like Klingons, in battle. They deserve
that much. <br>
WORF: Captain. I have another option.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 42901.3. Despite their
cloaking shields, we have located the Klingon vessel, T'Ong. In an

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: The T'Ong has changed course to three two

RIKER: Standard evasive manoeuvre. <br>
PICARD: Helm, stay with them. <br>
CLANCEY: Yes, sir. <br>
DATA: The T'Ong is now on a heading of four two mark one one three.
They are accelerating to warp five. <br>
RIKER: They're going to make a break for it. <br>
PICARD: Overtake, warp eight. <br>
CLANCEY: Aye. <br>
PICARD: Now, put us right in their path and come to a full stop. Full
power to shields. <br>
TACTICAL: Full power, sir. <br>
PICARD: Well, we've thrown down the gauntlet. Let's see if they pick it
up. <br>
DATA: They are slowing to impulse, sir. <br>
(The ship appears and fires) <br>
TACTICAL: Phaser hit on forward shields. Firming up now. No damage. <br>
RIKER: I guess we've piqued their interest now. <br>
PICARD: Agreed. Let's give them the chance to look their enemy in the
face. Ready, Lieutenant? <br>WORF: Open hailing frequencies. <br>
TACTICAL: Open, sir. <br>
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: What? What is this? <br>
(Worf and K'Ehleyr are in Klingon uniforms, sitting where Picard and
Riker should be) <br>
WORF: Captain K'Temoc, have you lost your mind? Halt your vessel and
drop your shields. <br>
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: What treachery is this? By whose authority? <br>
WORF: I am Worf, commanding the Enterprise. And it is you who have
committed an act of treason by firing upon this ship. <br>
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: I have standing orders to fire on all
Federation ships! <br>
WORF: You fool! Did it not occur to you that the war would be over by
now? <br>
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: I have no proof of that. <br>
WORF: Trust your eyes. Or is your brain still stuck in its long
slumber? <br>
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: How do I know this is not a Federation trick?
How can I be sure? <br>
WORF: Captain, as you are new to this century, I have tried to be
patient. But I will tolerate no further insubordination. Drop your
shields. Immediately. <br>
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: And if I refuse? <br>
WORF: Then die in ignorance. I can waste no more time on you. Phasers
to full power. <br>
TACTICAL: Aye, sir. Phasers ready. Target locked. <br>
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: You dare not destroy us. We are on a crucial
mission by order of the Klingon High Command. <br>
WORF: Has the T'Ong dropped its shields? <br>
TACTICAL: No, sir. <br>
WORF: Very well. Fire all phasers. <br>
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: Wait! Lower the shields. I yield command of
the T'Ong to you, Captain Worf. Long live the Klingon Empire. <br>
WORF: A wise decision, Captain. Commander K'Ehleyr will board your ship
and take command. The Klingon cruiser P'rang will soon arrive and
escort you home. And, Captain <br>
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: Yes? <br>
WORF: Welcome to the twenty fourth century. <br>
(Transmission ends. Picard and Riker come out of the Ready room) <br>
WORF: I return command of the ship to you, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. Congratulations. A very fine first
command. Well done. <br>
RIKER: How did you like command? <br>
WORF: Comfortable chair. <br>
K'EHLEYR: And you wore it well.

O'BRIEN: All set. <br>
WORF: I relieve you. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, Lieutenant. <br>
(O'Brien leaves) <br>
WORF: The Klingon vessel P'rang will rendezvous with you in three days.
<br>
K'EHLEYR: In the meantime, I'll begin the assimilation of these
Klingons to our era. <br>
WORF: Is there anything else you require? <br>
K'EHLEYR: No. Nothing else. Damn you, Worf. You'd let me go without
saying another word, wouldn't you? <br>
WORF: What needs to be said? <br>
K'EHLEYR: Nothing. Everything. We're about to go our separate ways
again. <br>
WORF: And that disturbs you? <br>
K'EHLEYR: I hid the truth from you. Last night did have meaning. I was
tempted to take the oath with you, but it scared me. I've never had
such strong feelings toward anyone. <br>
WORF: Nor have I. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Then it was more than just a point of honour. Maybe someday,
when our paths cross again, I won't be as easy to get rid of. <br>
WORF: K'Ehleyr. I will not be complete without you. </font> </p>
