RIKER: Captain. <br>
PICARD: Put your foot where it didn't belong? <br>
RIKER: The Doctor said she was getting bored. I just thought I'd give
her a challenge. <br>
PULASKI: That you did. The Commander's nervous system has been invaded
by an unknown microorganism. Not a bacteria, not a virus, but with the
elements of both. There's the point of entry. The microbes are
infecting the great sciatic nerve, and they are multiplying at an
incredible rate. There. <br>
PICARD: Can you remove it? <br>
PULASKI: Not surgically. The organisms fuse to the nerve, intertwining
at the molecular level. <br>
RIKER: That's why the transporter's biofilters weren't able to extract
it. <br>
PULASKI: There's no evidence of nerve damage, but the organisms are
impeding nervous function. <br>
RIKER: My leg's still asleep. <br>
PICARD: Prognosis? <br>
PULASKI: The infection is spreading. It will eventually reach the
brain. <br>
PICARD: And if it interfered with neural activity there? <br>
PULASKI: Commander Riker could die. <br>
PICARD: How can I help? <br>
PULASKI: I need to know more about its composition. <br>
PICARD: And for that, you need a sample. <br>
PULASKI: Exactly. <br>

LAFORGE: Don't like my company? <br>
DATA: Your company is not at issue. Your vulnerability to the
microorganism is. <br>
LAFORGE: I'll watch where I step. Besides, how do we know that this bug
doesn't like androids more than it likes humans? <br>
DATA: Possible, but highly unlikely. In any event, why risk both of us?

happened. <br>

LAFORGE: I'm not so sure. I can see thermal variations. Let it go for a

androids. <br>

LAFORGE: I'm counting on those great android reflexes of yours. <br>
(Even as he spoke, the root moved towards Geordi, and Data grabbed it) <br>
LAFORGE: That must be what we're looking for. <br>
DATA: I would tend to agree. <br>

to hurt the plant) <br>

PICARD: Get it to Sickbay right away. <br>
(La Forge leaves) <br>
PICARD: Report. <br>
DATA: Captain, Commander Riker's injury was not accidental. Certain
vines on the planet evidently seek out warm-blooded beings and
deliberately infect them. <br>
PICARD: To what end? <br>
DATA: Unknown, sir. It is conceivable there is a symbiotic relationship
involved. <br>
PICARD: Go on. <br>
DATA: There are numerous animal remains in the area, leading me to
hypothesize that the vines could be predatory. <br>
PICARD: Vines infect animals in order to kill them? <br>
DATA: It is possible. For Commander Riker's sake, I hope my hypothesis
is in error. <br>

what's keeping it alive. <br>

PULASKI: Oh, I can kill it but not without destroying the nerves it's
inhabiting. <br>

I thought. <br>

RIKER: I'm surprised they don't happen more often. After all, we are
exploring the unknown. <br>
PICARD: And the unknown can be benign or malevolent. <br>
RIKER: Captain, one of the things I've learned anything on these
voyages, on this ship, and from you, is that most life forms act out of
an instinct for survival, not out of malice. <br>
PICARD: It's an important lesson, and I admire your lack of resentment,
Number One. <br>

at the hammer.

Rikers are ornery, too. As a matter of fact, my great grandfather once
got bit by a rattlesnake. After three days of intense pain, the snake
died. <br>

character. I don't want to die, but if I have to, I'd like to do it

(But his eyes close and the machine beeps a warning as his indicators
drop into the red. Pulaski runs in) <br>
PULASKI: It's spread to the spinal column. It's weakening his autonomic
nervous system. Judging by its present rate of growth and its
infiltration pattern, the infection will spread to the brain within an
hour.

directly with electrical impulses.

TROI: Such as sadness <br>
PULASKI: Produce endorphins that inhibit the organisms' growth. <br>
TROI: Then we've found a way to repel the infection. <br>
PULASKI: Assuming we're not too late already. <br>
TROI: How much time do we have? <br>
PULASKI: I'm not sure. His vital signs are getting weaker. I don't want
to risk another dose of tricordrazine unless I have to. I must refocus
the pattern again. We need to isolate memories that generate stronger
negative emotions.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I know I can count on every Klingon warrior in this
crew to serve and die in that battle. So I ask you again, Commander
Riker. Where are your loyalties? <br>
RIKER: I have been assigned to serve this ship and to obey your orders.
And I will do exactly that. <br>
KARGAN: Will you take an oath to that effect? <br>
RIKER: I just did. <br>
KLAG: (in Klingon) Do not believe him! He lies! <br>
KARGAN: (in Klingon) Speak in their language. This is your Second
Officer, Lieutenant Klag. <br>
RIKER: Is there something you wanted to say to me, Lieutenant? <br>
KLAG: Yes sir. I do not believe you. <br>
RIKER: Then I take it you challenge my authority over you. <br>
KLAG: Correct. <br>
RIKER: And your position on this, Captain? <br>
KARGAN: I would say it your first command decision. <br>
(Riker looks around and thumps Klag in the stomach before throwing him
on the floor, then kicking him down before he can get up again, and
finally ramming his head into a computer panel. Lots of sparks. Kargan
laughs)<br>

like you to see it first? <br>
RIKER: What is it? <br>
QUINN: A form of life. It was discovered accidentally by a survey team
on an uncharted planet. <br>
RIKER: Why haven't we heard anything about that? <br>
QUINN: Oh, you'll be hearing about it shortly, but first there remains
much scientific study to be done. After all, it is a superior form of
life. <br>
RIKER: Superior? <br>
QUINN: Totally. Come, have a look. <br>
RIKER: I think I'll summon my Science Officer. <br>

further, but not enough. And his vital signs are deteriorating. <br>

the organisms. <br>

PULASKI: I can refocus the impulse pattern even tighter. But I don't
know if he can withstand it. He's extremely weak. <br>
