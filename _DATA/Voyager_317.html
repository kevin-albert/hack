CHARLENE: Jeffrey, Belle, you're going to be late if you don't hurry.
Come on now. Line up next to the door, children. Your father's ready to
leave for work. All right, show me your fingernails. Very nicely done.
Are your shoes polished? Perfect. I'm very pleased, children, and I'm
sure your father will be too. <br>
(How very idealistic 1950s USA.) <br>
BELLE: I want to be first to say goodbye to daddy. Jeffrey always goes
first. <br>
JEFFREY: You were first yesterday. <br>
CHARLENE: Now, children, little birds in their nest get along. <br>
JEFFREY: You're right, mother. I'm sorry, Belle, you can go first. <br>
BELLE: No, it's really your turn. I did go first yesterday. <br>
JEFFREY: Here he comes. <br>
CHARLENE: All right, now. Bright, happy faces. <br>
EMH: The coffee was quite good this morning. <br>
CHARLENE: I'm so glad you like it. I replicated a new blend from Paxau
three. <br>
EMH: I'll be home at the usual time. <br>
CHARLENE: Now don't let them overwork you. You should save yourself for
the important things. Others can do the busy work. <br>
EMH: I couldn't agree more. <br>
JEFFREY: I hope you have a good day, Father. I'll have my homework
finished by the time you get back. <br>
EMH: I'll look forward to reviewing it, Jeffrey. And is my little angel
going to get an A on her history exam today? <br>
BELLE: Of course I will, daddy, and can we do some algebra problems
when you get home? <br>
EMH: Gladly. <br>
CHARLENE: And don't forget, you're going to ask some of your friends
from work to have dinner with us. I'd like to meet them. <br>
EMH: I haven't forgotten. Well, goodbye all. <br>
ALL: Goodbye, daddy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
Ensign Kim, perhaps you could direct your attention to the sensors, and
tell us if we're nearing the Vostigye space station? <br>
KIM: We should be getting close. That's funny, I'm not detecting it. <br>
JANEWAY: You've checked the coordinates they sent us? <br>
KIM: Yes, and. Hold on. Now I'm getting something. It's debris. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Debris? <br>
TUVOK: Confirmed. I am reading a debris field encompassing nearly
eighty cubic kilometres. <br>
JANEWAY: What's the composition of the debris? <br>
KIM: Boronite, sarium, carbon 60 composites. <br>
PARIS: Sounds like it could have been a space station. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. What happened to it? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Something ripped it apart, and from the energy decay readings
I'd say it was no more than an hour ago. <br>
KIM: I'm not picking up any lifesigns, Captain. There don't appear to
be any survivors. <br>
JANEWAY: There were sixty Vostigye scientists on that station. <br>
TUVOK: I don't read any recognisable weapons signatures. <br>
PARIS: Maybe somebody in this part of space has weapons that don't
leave a traditional signature. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd like to know who they are, and why they'd annihilate a
science station. <br>
KIM: Maybe we can find out, Captain. There's a strange pattern that
seems to be emanating from subspace. Looks like some kind of plasma
particles. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I've got it too. It's like a wake, leading away from the
debris field. <br>
JANEWAY: From a ship? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I can't tell. <br>

(Fashion note - Torres is sporting a single small plait by the left
side of her face for this episode.) <br>
TORRES: Optical processors, imaging array, they all check out. Doctor,
you are in perfect health. <br>
EMH: I'm sure I could have told you that. <br>
TORRES: Yes, I'm sure you could have, but with all the tinkering you've
been doing with your programme lately, I feel better giving you these
little tune-ups on a regular basis. <br>
EMH: The tinkering you speak of has been for the sole purpose of
improving my performance as a physician. I can hardly be faulted for
that. <br>
TORRES: I'm not faulting you for your intentions, Doctor. I think it's
rather commendable that you want to improve yourself. <br>
EMH: That's why I've created a family. <br>
TORRES: A family? <br>
EMH: I've listened to enough patients talk about their families to
realise how meaningful they are to biological beings. <br>
TORRES: Well, for better or worse, yes. <br>
KES: The Doctor has created a holographic wife and two children so that
he can experience family life for himself. <br>
TORRES: Interesting. And how's it going so far? <br>
EMH: Splendidly. From what I heard, I thought it would be difficult,
but I'm enjoying the experience. <br>
TORRES: You are? Funny, I never thought of you as a family man, Doc.
I'd like to meet them. <br>
EMH: As a matter of fact, the little woman has been asking me to bring
some of my colleagues home for dinner. Perhaps you and Kes would care
to join us tonight? Charlene is a wonderful cook. <br>
KES: I'd like to meet them too. <br>
TORRES: Well, Doc, tell your wife to haul out the good china. You're
having company. </font></p>

CHARLENE: Please, have some more wild mushroom pilaf, B'Elanna. <br>
TORRES: Thanks, I've had two helpings already. It's delicious. <br>
CHARLENE: Well, I took a course in continental cuisine so I could
replicate interesting meals for Kenneth. <br>
KES: Kenneth? <br>
CHARLENE: My husband. What do you call him? <br>
KES: Oh, we call him Doctor. <br>
CHARLENE: Oh, of course. Anyway, he works terribly hard and he's under
such great stress, I want this home to be a sanctuary, the place he can
come and have all the cares of the day disappear. <br>
TORRES: How nice for him. <br>
BELLE: My daddy's a very important man. He's the best doctor there ever
was, and he saves people's lives all the time. <br>
EMH: A slight exaggeration. <br>
BELLE: It is not. You said <br>
EMH: Belle, eat your dinner. They're well aware of my talents. Jeffrey,
why don't you tell our guests about your new project at school. <br>
JEFFREY: I've designed a microfilter implant which will make it
possible to cleanse blood of harmful micro-organisms too small to
stimulate an immune response. <br>
EMH: Jeffrey is extremely bright. He's in the accelerated physical
sciences programme at school. <br>
TORRES: A regular chip off the old block, right? <br>
CHARLENE: And don't forget about our little Belle. She's already
studying algebra and trigonometry, and she's quite the budding athlete.
<br>
KES: You must be very proud of your family, Doctor. <br>
EMH: Oh. <br>
CHARLENE: Well, we're proud of him too. In fact, we think we have just
about the most wonderful husband and father in the quadrant, don't we <br>
TORRES: Computer, freeze programme. <br>
CHILDREN: Yes, we do <br>
EMH: Lieutenant, what are you doing? <br>
TORRES: I am stopping this before my blood sugar levels overload.
Doctor. <br>
EMH: Yes? <br>
TORRES: If you think that this is giving you an accurate impression of
being in a family, you are sadly mistaken. <br>
EMH: I don't understand. <br>
KES: They're kind of perfect. <br>
TORRES: They are ridiculously perfect. No one has a family like this.
This is a fantasy. You're not going to learn anything being with these
lollipops. <br>
EMH: I provided the computer with my requirements for a mate and
children. If I were to choose a real wife, my tastes would be the same.
Intelligence, education, organisational skills. <br>
TORRES: There is nothing wrong with your premise, Doctor, it just needs
a little tweaking to bring it closer to real life. I can help, if you'd
like. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PARIS:
Captain, the particle wave we've been following is beginning to thin
out. <br>
JANEWAY: Is there any indication what caused it? <br>
TUVOK: I am detecting no ships, no structures, no weapons signatures. <br>
KIM: Wait a minute. Something. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I see it too. A subspace disruption. <br>
JANEWAY: What's causing it? <br>
KIM: Can't tell, but it's getting more intense. <br>
(The ship starts shaking.) <br>
JANEWAY: Shields up. Red Alert. Tom, back us off. <br>
KIM: Something's coming out of subspace. <br>
(It is big, bright, and wormhole like.) <br>
JANEWAY: Tom, move us away. <br>
PARIS: I don't have engines. <br>
KIM: Propulsion is offline, so is navigational control. <br>
JANEWAY: Bridge to Engineering. We need power. <br>
TORRES [OC]: I'm on it, Captain. <br>
TUVOK: The anomaly is bearing down on us, heading zero four seven mark
one nine. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Brace for impact! <br>
KIM: It hit our starboard shields. <br>
TUVOK: There's damage on deck three. <br>
JANEWAY: Ready weapons. We're going to disperse it. <br>
TUVOK: Phasers online. <br>
PARIS: Wait a minute. <br>
(The anomaly passes.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm not afraid to say it. I've never seen anything like that
before. <br>
JANEWAY: Damage report. <br>
TUVOK: Twenty percent loss of the starboard dorsal shields, and minor
buckling of the hull on deck three. <br>
KIM: No indication of casualties. <br>
PARIS: We've got propulsion systems back online. I think I can put some
distance between us and whatever that was. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe we don't want to. We've just witnessed a phenomenon none
of us has ever heard of before, much less experienced. On a purely
scientific level, I think we owe it to ourselves to investigate. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm looking at the telemetry we've collected. It was an
astral eddy that seems to have formed at the confluence of space and
subspace. <br>
KIM: It's highly charged with plasma. That explains the particle wake. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If we could harness some of that energy, we could go off
replicator rations for a while. <br>
KIM: Captain, we don't have any idea what caused that phenomenon, or
what made it dissipate. So how do we investigate it if it's gone? <br>
JANEWAY: I suspect there are conditions in this part of space that lend
themselves to the formation of those eddies. Set sensors for continuous
scans of subspace. Maybe we can anticipate the next one. <br>
(Janeway's eyes light up. There's coffee in that eddy.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH: I
thought for a long time about what Lieutenant Torres said, and I
finally concluded she was right. If I'm going to have the experience of
a family, it should be as authentic as possible. <br>
KES: What changes have you asked her to make in the programme? <br>
EMH: Oh, she's already made them. She's simply added some randomised
behavioural algorithms to the programme I constructed. <br>
KES: How will it affect your family? <br>
EMH: Events will simply unfold as a matter of natural evolution of
probabilities within the programme, but there's no way to predict what
those might be. <br>
KES: That could mean a few surprises. Are you sure you've ready for
this? <br>
EMH: My database contains everything there is to know about paediatric
care and childhood development. I can't imagine a parenting problem I
couldn't handle. <br>
KES: Your wife will have changed too. <br>
EMH: Well, I have had some experience with romantic relationships. I
don't anticipate any problems there. <br>
KES: Sounds like you have it all worked out. When do you plan on
meeting this new, improved family? <br>
EMH: Right now. I'm due home for dinner. Computer, initiate Doctor's
Family Programme Beta-Rho and transfer the EMH to holodeck two. </font></p>

EMH: Home. <br>
CHARLENE: There you are. I thought you'd never get here. <br>
(The living room is not spick and span.) <br>
EMH: It was a busy day. I was quite challenged by the task of preparing
a DNA probe to test Ensign Parson's glial cells. It seems he has a
microbial infection. Rather unusual. <br>
CHARLENE: Tell me about it when I get home. I'm late already. <br>
EMH: Late? <br>
CHARLENE: It's Wednesday, remember? I'm speaking at the Bolian embassy.
<br>
EMH: Ah. Right. Is dinner ready? <br>
CHARLENE: It's your night to cook. <br>
BELLE [OC]: Mom! l can't find my ion mallet. <br>
CHARLENE: If you cleaned your room you'd have better luck. <br>
EMH: What is that noise? <br>
CHARLENE: I've had to listen to it all day. Maybe you can do something
about it. <br>
BELLE: Oh Daddy, you've got to help me. I'll be late for practice.
Coach Morgan'll be furious if I'm late again. <br>
EMH: If you put your mallet in your closet when you were done with it,
you'd know where it was. <br>
BELLE: I know that, Daddy. Oh, tell Jeffrey to turn that off. It makes
my eyes hurt! <br>

EMH: What is that music? <br>
JEFFREY: Klingon. <br>

LARG: Larg. <br>
K'KATH: K'kath. <br>
EMH: Well, Larg and K'kath, you'll have to come back later. Jeffrey's
doing his homework. <br>
LARG: He invited us. <br>
BELLE: Daddy! I need my iron mallet! <br>
EMH: I! Just a minute. I'm sorry, but Jeffrey can't see friends until
he has finished his homework. <br>
JEFFREY: Dad, I asked them to come. <br>
BELLE: Daddy! <br>
EMH: Jeffery, this is unacceptable. <br>
JEFFREY: It'll only take a minute. We have some business we have to do.

NEELIX: Pleeka rinds and grub meal. Very tasty, if I do say so myself. <br>
PARIS: Well, you did a great job with it, no question. It's just be
nice to have a little variety. <br>

NEELIX: Then, enjoy the casserole. <br>
(Torres is sitting, reading a PADD and sipping a drink.) <br>
PARIS: A beautiful woman should never have to eat alone. What are you
reading? <br>
TORRES: It's nothing important. <br>
PARIS: Women Warriors at the River of Blood? <br>
TORRES: It's just escapist reading. <br>
PARIS: Rork turned his fierce eye upon her, and B'Neah felt her heart
begin to quicken, even as her hand went to her dagger. She had intended
to plunge it into his throat, but something about him made her
hesitate. B'Elanna, is this a Klingon Romance novel? <br>
TORRES: Klingons do have what you might call a romantic side. It's a
bit more vigorous than most. <br>
PARIS: I think I'll read it. Maybe it'll give me some ideas how to make
your heart quicken. <br>
TORRES: It's not a technical manual, Tom. <br>
PARIS: Well, that depends what you mean by technical. <br>
TORRES: To an engineer, that means specialising in particular systems. <br>
PARIS: I think that definition works. <br>
TORRES: But I can't promise I won't put a dagger in your throat. Have
you heard about the Doctor's new family? <br>
PARIS: How's it going? <br>
TORRES: I think he was a little overwhelmed at first, but I have to
give him credit. He's sticking with it. <br>
PARIS: It's hard to imagine the Doctor with children. <br>

JANEWAY: Tom. I want to send a probe into that anomaly. Can you hold
position close enough for us to get accurate telemetry? <br>
PARIS: I can try. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Be ready to move away quickly if it starts moving towards us.
<br>
PARIS: Sorry about that. Just trying to find a way to ride the graviton
waves it's throwing off. There, that's a little better. We're in as
good a position as we're going to be. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok? <br>
TUVOK: The probe has been launched. <br>
PARIS: Actually, this is kind of fun. <br>
(Torres picks herself up off the deck.) <br>
TORRES: Speak for yourself. <br>
KIM: We're starting to receive telemetry. Captain, this is one weird
disturbance. I'm reading a temperature gradient of nine million
Kelvin's, massive discharges of plasmatic energy, and there's a
perfectly calm eye at the centre. <br>
TUVOK: Apparently some of the matter inside it is being exchanged
between space and subspace. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What about the plasma? Is there anyway we can transfer some
of it to Voyager? <br>
TORRES: I don't see how. We can't transport with this kind of
turbulence. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe we can try a <br>
(The eddy vanishes.) <br>
PARIS: We lost it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Where's the probe? <br>
KIM: It's disappeared. It's still transmitting, but there's a lot of
interference. <br>
TORRES: I'm detecting some kind of unstable interfold layer, not in
space or subspace. It could be where the eddies originate, and where
the probe is now. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We've got another particle wake. Since we can't get plasma
directly from the eddies, maybe we can collect some from their wakes. <br>
TUVOK: The Bussard collectors could be modified to gather plasma
particles. <br>
TORRES: We could do that, but Voyager's energy emissions are so high
they'd corrupt the particles. I'm not sure the plasma would be much use
to us. <br>
PARIS: What if I took a shuttle out? The energy emissions would be a
lot lower. <br>
JANEWAY: That sounds like it's worth a try. <br>
TORRES: You'd be exposing yourself to radiation poisoning. <br>
JANEWAY: Check with the Doctor. Maybe he can give you some kind of
protection. <br>
PARIS: Yes, ma'am. I'll head to the shuttlebay as soon as I'm done. </font></p>

I've given you a combination of hyronalin and lectrazine. That should
give you temporary protection, but I can't guarantee it's duration. <br>
PARIS: That's all right, Doc. I don't think I'll be out there too long.
<br>
EMH: If I know you, you'll push it to the limit. You enjoy flirting
with danger. <br>
PARIS: You know me too well. <br>
EMH: You were undoubtedly one of those children who had to climb the
highest tree, scale the tallest cliff. <br>
PARIS: That was me. <br>
EMH: I can only imagine what you must have put your parents through. <br>
PARIS: How's the family, Doc? I hear they're a real handful. <br>
EMH: Indeed. However, I have analysed the situation and come up with a
solution. There should be no more problems. <br>
PARIS: You make it sound like you're treating a sick patient. I'm not
sure you can diagnose and cure a family. <br>

ahead and engage in this reckless activity. <br>

CHARLENE: He's coming. <br>
EMH: I asked everyone to be here at sixteen hundred hours precisely. <br>
BELLE: Jeffrey was asleep. <br>
EMH: Asleep? In the middle of the afternoon? <br>
(Jeffery enters.) <br>
EMH: Is this true? Were you asleep? <br>
CHARLENE: Are you sick? <br>
JEFFREY: I had a late night. <br>
EMH: That's one of the matters I want to discuss. Thank you all for
coming. I thought it would be a good idea if we had a family meeting.
In fact, I'd like to do this on a regular basis. <br>
JEFFREY: That's something to look forward to. <br>
EMH: If you have something to say, Jeffrey, say it so everyone can
hear. <br>
JEFFREY: Nothing. <br>
EMH: I've been feeling that this family is beginning to spin out of
control. As husband and father I believe it is my duty to set some
parameters. It's part of good parenting. <br>
BELLE: What are parameters? <br>
EMH: Limits, boundaries. To that end, I have drawn up a revised family
schedule and a list of rules and regulations. I'd like you all to study
them carefully. <br>
CHARLENE: You've rearranged my lecture nights. <br>
EMH: I had to do that in order to make everything work. Everybody has
had to make some sacrifices. <br>
BELLE: Daddy! You changed Pareses Squares from Monday, Wednesday,
Friday to Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. That puts me on the second team.
I'm good enough to be on the first team. <br>
EMH: You shouldn't be on the first team. You're not old enough. As I
said, Belle, we must all make sacrifices. <br>
JEFFREY: What sacrifices did you make? <br>
EMH: I will make dinner on the nights your mother lectures. <br>
BELLE: You do that anyway. That's not a sacrifice. <br>
JEFFREY: What's this about no Klingon friends? <br>
EMH: Exactly that. They're a bad influence on you. They're prone to
violence, they keep you out till all hours. Why don't you find some
nice Vulcan friends? <br>
JEFFREY: You can't just decide who my friends will be. <br>
CHARLENE: Hold on. Kenneth, that may be a bit unreasonable. <br>
EMH: Charlene? You know very well how important it is to keep a united
front. I expect you to support me in these decisions. <br>
CHARLENE: Well, if that's what you expect then maybe you should have
asked my opinion before you started unilaterally deciding things. I'm
not one of the children, after all. I believe I should have some say in
just what rules and regulations are established. And I think it's
unfair for you to tell Jeffrey what friends he can and cannot have. <br>
JEFFREY: Right. This whole meeting is a Vulky idea, and you can have it
without me. <br>
(Jeffery leaves.) <br>
EMH: Jeffrey, you are not excused! <br>
CHARLENE: You've upset him. Let him go. I don't want to argue this in
front of the children. We'll discuss it later. <br>
(Charlene leaves.) <br>
BELLE: You really made a mess of things, didn't you, Daddy? <br>
EMH: Apparently so. Although I fail to understand their reaction. I'm
just trying to help the family function better. <br>
BELLE: How does it make the family function better if I go to Pareses
Squares Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturday? <br>
EMH: Belle, you've been playing with children two and three years older
than you. That's much too dangerous. <br>
BELLE: But that's what's fun about it. <br>
EMH: You're not old enough to realise how hazardous that game can be.
It's up to me to keep you safe. I'm just trying to be a good father. <br>
BELLE: If it'll help, Daddy, I'll be on the second team. <br>
EMH: Thank you, Belle. That's very grown up of you. <br>

EMH: Yes. What is it? <br>
JEFFREY: It's a knife. What does it look like? <br>
EMH: Why do you boys have a knife? <br>
LARG: A d'k tahg knife is an important part of our culture. Every
Klingon is given one at preparation for his Rite of Ascension. <br>
EMH: Hmm. <br>
(The EMH holds out his hand, and Larg gives him the knife, hilt first.)
<br>
EMH: I happen to know something about Klingon rituals, and I believe
this is actually a dagger of kut'luch. Isn't it? Well? <br>
LARG: Yes. <br>
EMH: This dagger is used in a ritual of violence. A first blood-letting
in preparation for becoming a warrior. Who's supposed to use this?
Well? Is one of you preparing for the kut'luch ceremony? I'm waiting
for an answer. <br>
JEFFREY: Dad, you're making something out of nothing. <br>
EMH: I don't think so. I'm going to have to ask you boys to leave. <br>
JEFFREY: Dad. <br>
EMH: And don't bring a weapon into this house again. <br>
LARG: I told you. Humans are weak, cowardly. <br>
JEFFREY: Call me later. <br>
(Larg and K'kath leave.) <br>

EMH: What exactly have I ruined? <br>
JEFFREY: Nothing. Never mind. <br>
EMH: You were going to use that knife, weren't you? Did they talk you
into some kind of ritual violence? <br>
JEFFREY: They didn't talk me into anything. I asked them. It's an
honour to get to perform the kut'luch. They don't just let anybody do
it. They trusted me, and now you've made me look like a, like a human. <br>
EMH: You were going to attack someone, draw blood, just so you could
appear daring in the eyes of your friends? <br>
JEFFREY: I was doing it to become honourable. Something that you
wouldn't understand. <br>
EMH: Jeffrey, how can I make you understand that what you are going to
do is wrong. <br>
JEFFREY: It isn't wrong, it's just the custom of another culture! Who
are you to say there's something wrong about it. <br>
EMH: I am your father and I expect you to be guided by my ethical
standards. <br>
JEFFREY: Well I'm not going to be. Your standards are human standards.
They're weak and inferior. Klingon ideals are much nobler, and they are
the one's I'm going to follow. <br>
EMH: If you expect to live in this household you will abide by the
rules. <br>
JEFFREY: If that's the way you want it, then I won't live here. <br>

I can't do that if I'm being led around on leash by some bloodless

CHARLENE: How is she? <br>
EMH: Doctor Findlay and I operated on her for three hours. We've tried
everything. We shut down one haemorrhage and another starts. <br>
CHARLENE: I don't understand. She just hit her head on the corner of
the court. How could that have injured her so badly? <br>
EMH: She suffered severe cranial trauma. It's compromised her brain
stem and motor cortex. No matter how we try to control the vascular
injuries, blood clots keep forming. The haemorrhaging is intractable. <br>
CHARLENE: Then what do you do? What's the treatment? <br>
EMH: Unfortunately, the brain is still a somewhat mysterious organ. <br>
CHARLENE: What does that mean? What's going to happen to her? <br>
EMH: There's nothing more to be done. Nothing medical, anyway. <br>
CHARLENE: But there has to be. Kenneth, you can do something. You have
to. You can't just let her. No. No, I won't accept it. I'm going to
talk to Doctor Findlay. <br>

PARIS: Well, think about what's happened to us here on Voyager.
Everyone left people behind, and everyone suffered a loss, but look how
it's brought us all closer together. We found support here, and
friendship, and we've become a family in part because of the pain we
shared. If you turn your back on this programme, you'll always be stuck
at this point. You'll never have the chance to say goodbye to your
daughter, or to be there for your wife and son when they need you. And
you'll be cheating yourself of the chance to have their love and
