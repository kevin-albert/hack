Note to those who are interested - Roxann is back after being missing
in Living Witness, because she was giving birth to her first daughter.)<br>KIM:
The ship is grey, Captain. We've cut power to decks four through nine.
Replicators, holodecks and all other nonessentials are offline.
Remaining systems are operating at twenty percent capacity. <br>
JANEWAY: Tom, how long can you keep us flying? <br>
PARIS: With the deuterium supply this low? Even at one quarter impulse
we'll be out of gas inside a week. <br>
JANEWAY: Everyone redouble your efforts. Keep your eyes open for new
sources of deuterium. Tuvok, Chakotay, I want recommendations for
further methods of conservation. Harry, you and I will give them a hand
in geophysics. See if we can't synthesise a substitute fuel. In the
meantime, we stay in grey mode. If anybody's got any other ideas, I'm
listening. <br>
PARIS: We could set up a bicycle in the mess hall, attach a generator,
pedal home. <br>
JANEWAY: Now why didn't I think of that? <br>
PARIS: And I volunteer Harry to take the first shift. <br>

Living space will be extremely limited. Take only those personal items
which are absolutely essential. <br>(Tuvok bumps into Neelix and his collection of duffel bags. He picks up a book which has fallen out.)<br>
NEELIX: Hello, there. <br>
TUVOK: What, may I ask, is this? <br>
NEELIX: That, Mister Vulcan, is the Selected Works of Jirex. <br>
TUVOK: Only essential items, Mister Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: Oh, Jirex is essential. He's the greatest writer in the
Talaxian canon. I never go to sleep without reading at least one of his
parables. <br>
TUVOK: A habit you will have to break until we're able to restore power
to crew quarters. <br>
NEELIX: I suppose I can try. <br>
TUVOK: And these? <br>(Bolsters and pillows.)<br>
NEELIX: I get terrible neck pains without them. <br>
TUVOK: I suggest you ask the Doctor to prescribe an anti-inflammatory. <br>
NEELIX: Fine. I don't mind roughing it. <br>
TUVOK: Mister Neelix. The blankets. <br>
NEELIX: No, no, that's where I draw the line. My mother knitted these
herself. I've slept with them since I was a child. <br>
TUVOK: You'll have to make do with standard issue bedding. <br>
NEELIX: Those Starfleet blankets give me a rash. <br>
TUVOK: I suggest you ask the Doctor <br>
NEELIX: For some anti-itch cream. I might as well sleep in Sickbay.
Thank you, Mister Vulcan. You've just given me an idea. <br>(Neelix leaves Tuvok holding his gear.)<br>

CHAKOTAY: What's going on here? <br>
SEVEN: I'm working. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You were ordered to shut down Astrometrics an hour ago. We
can't afford the power. Seven, it's inefficient. <br>
SEVEN: Efficiency is relative, Commander. If I shut down Astrometrics, I
won't be able to scan for new fuel sources. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I appreciate your efforts, but we'll have to use conventional
scanners until <br>(Beep!)<br>
SEVEN: Conventional scanners would not have found this. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What? <br>
SEVEN: Highly concentrated deuterium. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Where? <br>
SEVEN: Computer, display source. A planetoid point four light-years
from our present position. There are dense pockets of deuterium just
beneath the surface. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe so, but that's a Demon class planet. <br>
SEVEN: Demon class? <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's what Starfleet calls it. Also known as Class Y. It's
got a toxic atmosphere filled with thermionic radiation. Surface
temperatures are in excess of five hundred Kelvins. Just entering a
standard orbit would be suicide. <br>
SEVEN: Our situation is desperate. <br>
CHAKOTAY: True. <br>
SEVEN: When faced with desperate circumstances, we must adapt. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
Captain's log, supplemental. I've ordered adaptations to our shields to
repel the thermionic discharges. Hoping that the benefits will outweigh
the risks, we're now trying to beam deuterium from beneath the planet's

CHAKOTAY: The good news is Nozawa and Seven of Nine have both been
treated and released from Sickbay, and the planetary gases have been
expelled from the transporter room. <br>
JANEWAY: And the bad news? <br>
CHAKOTAY: The transporters are offline. It'll take days before they're
back again. <br>
JANEWAY: Great. We use valuable energy on a course change and all we get for
our trouble is another downed system. Can we send a probe to collect
the deuterium?<br>
TUVOK: It would incinerate within seconds of entering the upper
atmosphere. <br>
JANEWAY: Then I don't see any other options. Tom, put us back on our
original course, one quarter impulse. <br>
KIM: Captain, maybe I can help. <br>
PARIS: Harry, the bicycle thing was just a joke. <br>
KIM: I've been thinking. With Tuvok's shield modifications and a few
tweaks to an environmental suit, I could take a shuttle to the surface
and mine the deuterium from there. <br>
TUVOK: Need I remind you, Ensign, that there is no environment less
hospitable to humanoid life than a Class Y. <br>
KIM: Actually, Tuvok, no, you needn't remind me. What's the
alternative? Resume course? Creep along at quarter impulse hoping we
find fuel before we end up dead in the water? We've got deuterium
within arm's reach. We can't let the opportunity slip away without at
least trying. <br>
CHAKOTAY: He's got a point. <br>
JANEWAY: You wouldn't be able to communicate with us if you got in
trouble, and until we get transporters back we couldn't beam you out. <br>
TUVOK: Even with modifications, it wouldn't be long before your suit
began to corrode. Exposure to that atmosphere could kill you within
minutes. <br>
KIM: I know the risks. <br>
JANEWAY: Even if I agreed, I'd never let you go alone. <br>
KIM: Of course not. That's why I'm volunteering my good buddy Tom here
to go with me. <br>

You were pretty forceful in there. <br>
KIM: So? <br>
PARIS: So? I don't think I've ever seen you that assertive in a staff
meeting before. You must be bucking for a promotion. <br>
KIM: I had an idea and I spoke up, that's all. <br>
PARIS: Oh, no, no, no. It was more than that. You put Tuvok in his
place right in front of everybody. <br>
KIM: He was stating the obvious again. Talking down to me like I didn't
know anything about Demon Class planets. <br>
PARIS: I am not criticising you. Believe me, nobody enjoys seeing the

PARIS: What, then. <br>
KIM: How do I explain this? When I first came on board Voyager I was
pretty green, right? <br>
PARIS: A deep, almost fluorescent green, if I remember correctly. <br>
KIM: I was young, inexperienced, and I acted like it. Nervous about
giving my opinion, hesitant to make suggestions, so I usually just kept
my mouth shut. And I behaved that way for so long it became a habit.
But, in the last four years, a lot has happened. I've fought the Borg,
been transformed into an alien, helped defeat the Hirogen. Hell, I've
even come back from the dead. <br>
PARIS: It's been a wild ride. <br>
KIM: I woke up the other morning and it suddenly hit me. I've got a lot
of experience now, so why should I be afraid to take the initiative or
voice my ideas? <br>

caves. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Then we'll call again when we get back outside. <br>

it's like when you're a kid who's afraid of the water and you suddenly
realise that you can swim. Go ahead, take your helmets off. Try it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm glad you're feeling all right, but none of us should be
taking any risks until we know exactly what's going on. <br>
PARIS: Don't tell me that a big, tough guy like you is afraid of a little
poisoned atmosphere?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Where's Harry? <br>
PARIS: He's further inside the cave. We found a huge cache of
deuterium. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Let's find him and get you two back to the ship. <br>

That stuff is in our blood? <br>
EMH: I'm afraid so. From what I can tell, you've been bioformed. <br>
KIM: Bioformed? <br>
EMH: Think of it as the opposite of terraforming. In the same way we
adapt the environment of a planet to suit our needs, this planet has
adapted you. <br>
PARIS: How is that possible? <br>
EMH: This fluid somehow entered your bloodstream and began altering
your physiology at the cellular level. I haven't had the time to
analyse this substance, but I hope to have answers soon. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd like to run a few tests of my own, if you don't mind. <br>
EMH: Of course. <br>
PARIS: So, what's our prognosis, Doc? <br>
EMH: Well, you'll be fine. As long as you keep breathing the planet's
gases. <br>
KIM: You mean we have to stay inside this forcefield? <br>
EMH: I'm afraid it's worse than that. The atmosphere of this planet
can't be replicated safely. <br>
PARIS: Which means if we leave, we'll have nothing to breathe. <br>
EMH: Exactly. Either we find a way to treat your condition, or you'll
have to be left behind. <br>
JANEWAY: Can the bioforming process be reversed? <br>
EMH: As it stands, I don't know enough about the phenomenon to undo it. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll send Chakotay and Seven back to the surface. They'll
gather as much information as they can. B'Elanna and I will start
running tests on this. <br>
