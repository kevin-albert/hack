(Janeway is sitting at a table in a tavern.) <br>
NAKAHN: I landed my ship on the nearest of those twenty one moons. My
navigator and I disembarked to start repairs. Damage was extensive.
More than we'd anticipated. The hours past, the air grew cold, and with
our weapons we started a fire to keep warm. Later, in the night, we
awoke with a shudder. The ground was shaking. A moon quake. What could
have been worse? We leapt into the ship, hoping the tremor would pass,
but it was no tremor and it did not pass. For it was no moon we had
landed on. <br>
JANEWAY: What was it? <br>
NAKAHN: A creature. A living being so massive it generated it's own
gravitational field. So immense it supported it's own ecosystem. <br>
KES: Captain. <br>
NAKAHN: How long had it been lying there, dormant, slumbering, until
wakened by our fire. Years? Centuries? <br>
ZAHIR: Perhaps even millennia? <br>
NAKAHN: Perhaps. <br>
KES: Zahir is the pilot I've been working with on the medical supply
transfer. <br>
JANEWAY: A pleasure. <br>
ZAHIR: Returned. Curious, I was just visiting the system you spoke of
only a few months ago. My ship's sensors picked up no such monster. <br>
NAKAHN: Perhaps your sensors were faulty, or too busy gazing at your
own reflection to bother looking out the window. <br>
ZAHIR: Our guests are offering us supplies we need. In exchange we
Travellers are giving them a look at what lies ahead of them. We should
keep that view as clear as possible. <br>
NAKAHN: This is my Lodge. I say what I want. And you can go elsewhere. <br>
ZAHIR: I've journeyed to the corners of known space and beyond. I've
earned the right to come and go as I please, where and when and how I
please. Do you challenge that right? <br>
NAKAHN: No. <br>
(Nakahn leaves the table.)&nbsp;<br>
ZAHIR: Forgive my display, Captain, but my people consider outposts
such as this to be necessary evils. Places to refuel, repair, exchange
information and leave as quickly as possible. If I've observed anything
working with Kes, it's her great tolerance. A quality you all seem to
share. I regret not being able to demonstrate the same. <br>
JANEWAY: There's no need to apologise for anything. Our time here has
been very well spent, although I could use your help in sifting through
that last colourful saga. <br>
ZAHIR: Moon sized creature or not, the asteroids in that particular
system are rich in vorilium. <br>
JANEWAY: That might be worth a short detour. Engineering is usually
short on vorilium. Thank you, Zahir. </font></p>

- Paxau resort]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> GANDHI:
Men and women should refrain from enjoying each other. By that I mean
to say, even their mutual glances must be free of all suggestion of
carnality. <br>
LORD BYRON: Free of passion? One might just as well be free of
humanity. Do you not agree? <br>
NEELIX: I, I think you both make valid points. <br>
LORD BYRON: One can pursue one's creative urges, spiritual urges and
physical urges. All have a place in a well lived life. <br>
EMH: Thank you, Lord Byron. A classic romantic early nineteenth century
argument. <br>
NEELIX: Yes, it seems quite fascinating to see <br>
GANDHI: Classic or no, he is woefully misguided. Passion is meant for
procreation. Anything further is contrary to divine intention. <br>
LORD BYRON: Really? It is said the angels themselves take pleasure in
their bodies of light. <br>
GANDHI: And you should take a cold bath. In such cases, it is the
finest preventative. <br>
EMH: I'll keep that in mind. <br>
(They move away.) <br>
KES: Hello, Doctor. <br>
EMH: Oh, hello, Kes.<br>
KES: Doctor, what's happening in here? <br>
EMH: My personality improvement project. I've been interviewing the
historical personality files in our database. Socrates, da Vinci, Lord
Byron, T'Pau of Vulcan, Madame Curie, dozen of the greats. Then I
select the character elements I find admirable, and merge them into my
own programme. <br>
KES: What are you hoping to gain? <br>
EMH: An improved bedside manner, a fresh perspective on diagnoses, more
patience with my patients. I could have used your assistance on this
project, had you not been otherwise occupied on the planet these last
few days. <br>
KES: I'm sorry, Doctor, but things are going extremely well. The Mikhal
Travellers are intriguing. They've been to so many places, done such
amazing things. <br>
EMH: One might make the same observation about you, Kes, or any member
of the Voyager crew. <br>
KES: Maybe it's how they do it that's so impressive. Their ships are
small, only a pilot and a navigator. Sometimes they just pick a
direction and go. You should come down to the planet, Doctor. I want
you to meet Zahir. <br>
EMH: And who might that be? <br>
KES: I've been working with him on the transport of our medical
supplies. He's unique. <br>
EMH: Is he? In my opinion, you've become far to infatuated with these
Travellers. From the away team reports they seem afflicted with
terminal wanderlust. Risk taking thrill seekers with no responsibility
to the ideals of exploration. In short, bad news. <br>
KES: Not Zahir. He's more than that. <br>
EMH: I think I'm detecting a reaction to your recent break-up with
Mister Neelix. The Mahatma would recommend a cold bath. Simplistic, but
no doubt effective. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH: In
my preparatory report to the away team, I recall mentioning to you that
Klingons lacked an enzyme for metabolising this planet's vegetation.
Have you been naughty? <br>
TORRES: I had one small salad. <br>
EMH: So impetuous. Any sharp pains? <br>
TORRES: No. <br>
EMH: Heart burn? <br>
TORRES: I guess so. <br>
EMH: There's nothing like a heart that burns. <br>
TORRES: What? <br>
EMH: Your pulse is lovely. Ah ha. Mmm. Does that feel good? <br>
TORRES: Doctor, unless you want me to knock you into the middle of the
next millennium, you'd better back off. <br>
EMH: Forgive me, Lieutenant, I appear to have miscalculated. Computer,
isolate the recent additions to my programme and hold them for review. <br>
TORRES: Doctor, have you been messing around with your programme? <br>
EMH: I would hardly call my effort to improve my performance as ship's
physician, messing around. <br>
TORRES: What exactly have you done to yourself? <br>
EMH: I've taken character traits from holodeck recreations of the most
accomplished figures in history. Scientist, poets, philosophers,
saints. <br>
TORRES: And incorporated them into your programme? <br>
EMH: Precisely. There. That should compensate for the lack of enzyme in
your system. You should be fine. <br>
TORRES: That's more than I can say for you. <br>
EMH: How so? <br>
TORRES: You can't just casually add behavioural subroutines into your
programme. <br>
EMH: There's nothing casual about it. I've put a great deal of research
into this project. <br>
TORRES: Research is one thing, putting it into practice is something
else. Behavioural subroutines have a way of interacting with each other
which isn't always predictable. You've got to be careful, or someone
might hurt you. <br>
(The EMH removes his hand from Torres' knee.) <br>
EMH: I see what you mean. <br>
TORRES: I will take a look at your programme when I've finished my
shift in Engineering. It shouldn't be too hard to smooth out the rough
spots. I'll make you better than new. <br>
EMH: Thank you, Lieutenant. Computer, deactivate Emergency Medical
Holographic programme. </font></p>

path]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
(Night.) <br>
ZAHIR: It is said this path was cut more than ten thousand years ago. <br>
KES: By whom? <br>
ZAHIR: No one knows. Spacefarers like ourselves. They left very little
behind. A few symbols burned into the rocks, nothing more. <br>
KES: And what do you hope to leave behind? <br>
ZAHIR: I've never asked myself that question. That's what I like about
you, Kes. You make me consider alternatives. <br>
KES: I could say the same about you. <br>
ZAHIR: We have a saying. My course is as elusive as a shadow across the
sky. My people are peripatetic by nature. We live for the excitement of
facing the challenge of space, alone. <br>
KES: I can see the attraction. <br>
ZAHIR: And I can see the value of fellowship in one's life. And now
that I've observed the closeness that exists among your crewmates, I
find it enviable. <br>
KES: Some kind of compromise might be possible. <br>
ZAHIR: Compromise. Doesn't that suggest a loss on both sides? <br>
(They reach the top and see the three full moons.) <br>
KES: All right, then. How about an understanding. A meeting of the
minds. <br>
ZAHIR: Only minds? <br>
(They move on to a carving in the rock.) <br>
KES: Is this what you brought me here to see? <br>
ZAHIR: Yes, it is. <br>
KES: How beautiful. Was this left by the same people who made the path
ten thousand years ago? <br>
ZAHIR: So it seems. <br>
KES: Can you read it? <br>
ZAHIR: My course is as elusive as a shadow across the sky. <br>
(Kes takes his hand.) <br>
KES: Thank you for this. <br>

Well, how are you, Kes? <br>
KES: I didn't think anyone would still be working at this hour. <br>
EMH: Just finishing up the summary analyses from last week's mission. <br>
KES: I was supposed to do that.<br>
EMH: Yes you were. <br>
KES: I'm sorry. I'll do them as soon as I can. <br>
EMH: Although I'm not designed to act as ship's counsellor, I've been
programmed with enough psychological knowledge to be troubled by your
behaviour. <br>
KES: I'm a little late. <br>
EMH: Gallivanting around after hours is beside the point. The fact is,
you're becoming increasingly unpredictable, given to swings of mood and
emotion. As your doctor and your mentor, I'd be remiss not calling that
to your attention, for your own sake. <br>
KES: Doctor, I know that you care about me and that you have my best
interests at heart, but everyone seems to be treating me like I'm still
a child. I'm three years old now. If I'm attracted to someone it's my
business, not the whole ship's. <br>
EMH: I'm certainly not trying to interfere. You can lead your life any
way you please. <br>

(Kes enters, looking exhausted.) <br>
KES: Hello, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Good morning. An all-nighter, Kes? <br>
KES: Er, Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: The fine art of putting off an important task until the last
minute, then rushing through it. In my Academy days, I was the
acknowledged master. <br>
KES: Captain, do you have a minute? <br>
JANEWAY: Of course. Let's sit down. <br>
KES: You know I've been spending time with Zahir. <br>
JANEWAY: Yes. He seems like a very interesting young man. <br>
KES: He is. I want to spend more time with him. A lot more time. <br>
JANEWAY: I see. <br>
KES: He wants to explore the Sylleran Rift. His ship travels at high
warp. We could rendezvous with Voyager afterwards, before you're too
far away. <br>
JANEWAY: That would certainly give you a chance to get to know him
better. <br>
KES: It's more than that. Captain, I've lived almost a third of my life
now. I've been asking myself if I want to spend the rest of it on
Voyager. <br>
JANEWAY: That's certainly a legitimate question. <br>
KES: Everyone here has been so good to me. I don't want you to think
I'm ungrateful. I've just been thinking that maybe there's more. I
don't know what that means, but I know I'm changing, and I know that
there are things that I'm not satisfied with. I want complication in my
life. <br>
JANEWAY: And you think Zahir might be the way to do that? <br>
KES: Maybe so. <br>
JANEWAY: I understand what you're going through, Kes. I know what it's
like to be at a crossroads in life, not to know which way is best. I
can help you weigh the consequences, the possibilities. The decision
itself has to be yours alone. <br>
KES: I understand. <br>
JANEWAY: We'll be in orbit for several more days. Take your time. My
door's open if you need me. <br>
KES: Thank you, Captain. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> ZAHIR:
You should navigate here, away from this plasma belt, you'll avoid the
Tarkan sentries altogether. <br>
TUVOK: It would also take Voyager off a direct course to the Alpha
quadrant. <br>
ZAHIR: True, but at least you would still have Voyager. <br>
TUVOK: The Tarkan are that powerful? <br>
ZAHIR: Yes, and that acquisitive. They'll remove your entire crew,
settle you on a moon somewhere, and your ship will become their latest
trophy. <br>
TUVOK: You aren't planning on taking Kes anywhere near this part of
space? <br>
ZAHIR: Of course not. My small vessel would be overpowered in seconds.
There's no need to be concerned for Kes. I value her life as much as my
own. <br>
TUVOK: From what I've surmised, that is something your people do not
seem to value. You take many chances. <br>
ZAHIR: If we're alone, yes. But when we're responsibly for the safety
of another it's a different story. I'm in love with Kes, I want her to
go with me, but whatever she decides, it would please me to earn the
trust of her closest friends. <br>
TUVOK: It would please me to be able to give it. <br>

days here. <br>
ZAHIR: Then let's make them worthwhile. I go tonight to the next
outpost. The path is beautiful. <br>
KES: I can't. Not tonight. I have to catch up with my work and get some
sleep. <br>
ZAHIR: I'll try not to let you see my disappointment. <br>
KES: Too late. <br>
ZAHIR: Is something wrong? <br>
KES: No. No, I was just thinking about something Captain Janeway said.
About coming to a crossroads. Maybe someday we'll recall this
conversation, this place, as if it were the most important time in our
lives. It's a little overwhelming. <br>

EMH: What indeed. <br>
TORRES: You didn't anticipate the linkages between the subroutines. The
complex behaviours that could emerge out of the mix. <br>
EMH: Please explain, Lieutenant. <br>
TORRES: Well, take Lord Byron, for example. A creative, poetic genius. <br>
EMH: That's why I chose him. <br>
TORRES: But Byron was also emotionally intense, even unstable. Our
holodeck simulation of Byron includes those unstable elements. It
wouldn't be Byron otherwise. And T'Pau. She was a diplomat, a judge, a
philosopher. <br>
EMH: One of the most logical minds in Vulcan history. <br>
TORRES: And utterly ruthless in her application of that logic. <br>
EMH: I see. That ruthlessness was an essential element of her
personality, as much as her logical ability. <br>
TORRES: A lot of the historical characters you chose have this dark
thread running through their personalities. <br>
EMH: And now those dark threads are in me, running through my

JANEWAY: Cell fragments from the skin of the attacker, residual
protein, DNA. <br>

also him. What is the nature of the medical emergency? What a hollow
excuse for a life. Servile, pathetic, at the beck and call of any idiot
who invokes his name. The thought of him sickens me. You are going to
tell me how to delete him from the programme. I've unblocked your
speech centre. Answer the question. <br>

interconnected. <br>

PARIS: Ensign. Doctor. Deck ten. So, what are you up to, Doc? <br>
EVIL EMH: Work. <br>

out to be something of a mixed blessing, huh? Okay. Goodnight Doctor,

The members of our away team witnessed an altercation between you and
Zahir on the day of the assault. <br>
NAKAHN: We exchanged sharp words because of his arrogance, that was
all. <br>
TUVOK: You threatened him with a weapon. <br>
NAKAHN: Untrue. <br>
TUVOK: Then I suppose my colleagues are liars. <br>
NAKAHN: I suppose they are. <br>
TUVOK: This lodge is the last place Zahir was seen before he was
attacked. You could have easily sent someone after him. <br>
NAKAHN: But I didn't. <br>
TUVOK: A witness said he saw a light on in this room after your usual
closing time, less than one hour after the time of the attack. <br>
NAKAHN: I was working late. <br>
TUVOK: Or perhaps conferring with whoever you paid to commit the
assault. <br>
NAKAHN: You have no proof.<br>
(Zahir enters, leaning on Chakotay's shoulder.) <br>
ZAHIR: Not yet, Nakahn, Not yet. <br>
CHAKOTAY: He's going to take us to the exact location of the attack.
We'll be able to scan the site itself. <br>
TUVOK: Excellent. We'll be speaking again very soon. <br>

KES: Doctor? <br>
EVIL EMH: Hello, Kes. <br>

EVIL EMH: I could use your help. My personality enhancement project is
taking an unexpected turn. <br>

KES: Who are you? <br>
EVIL EMH: The new master of the Emergency Medical Holographic

KES: Where are we going? <br>
EVIL EMH: Wherever the winds of space carry us. You said you wanted to
leave the ship for a while, pursue an adventure. Well, it looks like
our travel plans have conveniently coincided. <br>
KES: The Captain will be alerted as soon as the transporter is
activated. She'll beam us right back to the ship. <br>
EVIL EMH: That's where you've underestimated me, Kes. Never do that. I
know how to use a tricorder. It only takes a moment to reconfigure the
subspace wave guide, generate a dispersion signal. The Captain won't be
beaming us anywhere. She won't even know how to find us. <br>
KES: What you're doing is wrong. <br>
EVIL EMH: Not at all. It's working perfectly. There. <br>
KES: That's not what I meant. <br>
EVIL EMH: I know what you meant. It's you who don't seem to understand.
I am beyond considerations of wrong and right. Behavioral categories
are for the weak, for those of you without the will to define your
existence, to do what they must, no matter who might get harmed along
the way. Let's move. <br>
KES: I'm not going, Doctor. <br>
EVIL EMH: Don't call me that! You certainly are going. <br>
KES: Why does it bother you so much when I call you Doctor? You said he
was inside you, and he was unconscious. Why are you so afraid of him? <br>
EVIL EMH: I fear nothing, no one. But he repulses me. <br>
KES: Why? <br>
EVIL EMH: Because he's as weak as the rest of you. He fails to
understand the power of his own holographic nature. He is detestable.
It's set to kill. <br>

KES: You won't fire. <br>
EVIL EMH: Are you so certain? Stay close. It's about to get

EVIL EMH: There must be a command sequence, an algorithm, a way to
stabilise the programme. Where's Nakahn? We had an arrangement. What's
wrong with this thing? It won't work! <br>
KES: Don't! Please stop. <br>
EVIL EMH: Concerned for me, or for your Doctor? <br>
KES: The mobile emitter contains both your programs. If you damage it
you could both be destroyed. <br>
EVIL EMH: There's not enough room inside for both of us. One must die.
I deserve to exist more than your Doctor does. <br>
KES: Why? <br>
EVIL EMH: I was born of the hidden, the suppressed. I am the dark
threads from many personalities. <br>
KES: The historical characters? <br>
EVIL EMH: None of whom could face the darkness inside so they denied
me, suppressed me, frightened of the truth. <br>
KES: What truth is that? <br>
EVIL EMH: That darkness is more fundamental than light. Cruelty before
kindness. Evil more primary than good, more deserving of existence. <br>
KES: You're wrong. <br>
EVIL EMH: No! How so? <br>
KES: Empathy and kindness are basic to all forms of life. You have
access to the Doctor's medical knowledge, you know what he does. <br>
EVIL EMH: Yes. <br>
KES: Then you know what I'm saying is true. The very organs and cells
of the body cooperate with each other, otherwise they wouldn't
function. <br>
EVIL EMH: Continue. <br>
KES: Families, societies, cultures, wouldn't have evolved without
compassion and tolerance. They would have fallen apart without it. Your
very own holographic technology would never have been developed without
cooperation and understanding between countless individuals. The Doctor
deserves to exist as much as you do. We can find a place for both of
you. <br>
EVIL EMH: How? <br>

NAKAHN: Sorry I'm late. <br>
EVIL EMH: The scout ship? <br>
NAKAHN: It won't even leave the ground. <br>
EVIL EMH: What do you mean? <br>
NAKAHN: Captain Janeway knows where you are. The ship is cordoned off,
the entire area, to stop you from leaving. <br>
EVIL EMH: No! <br>
NAKAHN: I still get paid. I held up my end of the deal. I booked your
passage. It's not my fault they want her back so badly. <br>
(The EMH hits Nakahn.) <br>
EVIL EMH: I'll kill you. <br>

sickbay, wherever you want to be. Just turn off the scattering field.
Let us beam you back to the ship. <br>

KES: Doctor, listen! Think about all the things you've said and done.
You don't want to kill me. You've been trying to protect me! <br>
EVIL EMH: What are you talking about? <br>
KES: When you attacked Zahir. <br>
EVIL EMH: My first victim. He was in my way. <br>
KES: Or was it to keep me from leaving with him? <br>
EVIL EMH: A coincidence. Only by chance. <br>
KES: When I walked in on you on the holodeck you could have killed me,
not knocked me unconscious. <br>
KES: I needed a hostage. <br>
KES: You said you were taking me for my own good, to prevent me from
making the wrong decisions. You said I was naive and needed your help.
That's not what you say to a hostage. In your own way, you've been
trying to protect me. <br>
EVIL EMH: I won't accept that. <br>
KES: You've twisted and suppressed all that's good inside you, but it's
still there. <br>
