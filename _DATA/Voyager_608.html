Naomi Wildman. State your purpose here. <br>
NAOMI: I was waiting for you. Kadis-kot, remember? Our weekly game? <br>
SEVEN: Reschedule for tomorrow. I'm working now. <br>
NAOMI: Redecorating isn't work. <br>
SEVEN: Aesthetics are irrelevant. I'm modifying the alcove to function
as a cortical processing sub-unit. <br>
NAOMI: That was my next guess. <br>
SEVEN: Then I won't need to explain its purpose. <br>
NAOMI: Okay, you win. What do you do with a cortical processing er<br>
SEVEN: Sub-unit. On Borg vessels, there's one in each Unimatrix. It
downloads newly assimilated data to the drones. <br>
NAOMI: But Voyager isn't a Borg vessel, and you're not a drone anymore. <br>
SEVEN: Voyager collects a great deal of information. Sensor scans,
navigational projections, engineering updates, away team reports,
scientific analyses. <br>
NAOMI: The results of our Kadis-kot tournament? <br>
SEVEN: That, too. The crew must read and study this information. An
inefficient procedure. These data nodes are downloading the information
into the alcove. <br>
NAOMI: Which is going to download it into you. <br>
SEVEN: Precisely. In a matter of hours, I will assimilate several
months worth of data. <br>
NAOMI: Can I try it sometime? <br>
SEVEN: Your physiology is different from mine. <br>
NAOMI: Guess I'll stick to reading my lessons and listening to Neelix
tell stories. <br>

Second-degree burns. <br>(Janeway uses a napkin to collect it from the replicator.)<br>JANEWAY: ( I've been slaving over that replicator programme
for hours. What was this bizarre rumour I heard about half the crew on
deck five getting pregnant? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Oh, that. The Doctor was running generational projections on
the Sickbay computer. Tom Paris happened to glance at the monitor and
jumped to conclusions. Wasn't long before Neelix was asking me if he
could turn Cargo Bay one into a nursery. <br>
JANEWAY: Word travels fast on this ship, hmm? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Warp ten. Oh, by the way, I meant to tell you. There's a
Class K nebula twenty five light years off starboard. We should take a
look. <br>
JANEWAY: A major detour for a minor nebula. <br>

TUVOK: Can you be more specific? <br>
JANEWAY: Not at this distance. Tom, alter course. I want to take a
closer look. <br>
PARIS: Chakotay had his heart set on that nebula we're headed for. <br>
JANEWAY: He'll have to wait. <br>(Torres and Seven enter.)<br>
TORRES: Captain, I need permission to shut down the sensor grid. Seven
thinks a couple of insects are disrupting the power flow. <br>
SEVEN: A mating pair of photonic fleas, to be more accurate, and
possibly their offspring. <br>
JANEWAY: And how did you arrive at this theory? <br>
SEVEN: Last night, I downloaded six months of ship status reports into
my new cortical sub-unit while I was regenerating. <br>
PARIS: Learn while you sleep. I tried that once, It gave me a headache. <br>
JANEWAY: Go on. <br>
SEVEN: Eight weeks ago, an away team encountered a Kartelan freighter
carrying supplies from sector four nine two, a territory that included
a former Talaxian colony. Mister Neelix used the opportunity to acquire
twelve kilograms of amber spice, a delicacy among his people. <br>
TORRES: What does that have to do with the sensor grid? <br>
SEVEN: On the same day, Ensign Kim was repairing a replicator in the
Mess hall. <br>
KIM: I remember that. Neelix told me to stick around and try something
he was cooking. <br>
SEVEN: No doubt made with the amber spice, which contained the larvae of
the photonic fleas. <br>
TORRES: How could you possibly know that? <br>
SEVEN: Because I also downloaded data regarding their life cycles. The
larvae flew out of the spice jar in search of their primary source of
nourishment, plasma particles. The conduits within the nearby sensor
grid contain an unlimited supply of these particles. Ensign Kim had
unwittingly given the creatures access by exposing the grid. The now
mature creatures periodically tap into the conduit for nourishment.
When they do, the sensor emitters momentarily lose their resolution. <br>

TUVOK: They are hailing us. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. (A thin faced saurian with a long bony protruberance all the way up the middle of his face from his nose.)<br>
TASH [on viewscreen]: I recommend maximum shielding. There are a few
technical issues I haven't worked out yet. <br>
KIM: There's a massive graviton surge coming from that thing. <br>
TUVOK: Shields to full. <br>(Whumph!)<br>

TASH [on viewscreen]: If I don't find a way to repair this power core
they'll be able to see the explosion all the way to, er, where did you
say you were from? <br>
JANEWAY: I didn't, but we're from a planet called Earth. <br>
TASH [on viewscreen]: All the way to Earth. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Can we ask you what it's supposed to do? <br>
TASH [on viewscreen]: Catapult a vessel across space, in the time it
takes to say catapult a vessel across space. It'll make warp drive look
like a wooden sledge. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe we can help you with that power core. <br>
TASH [on viewscreen]: Hmm? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Briefing

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TASH:
The core sends a graviton surge through the projectors which locks onto
a ship and sends it hurtling into null space, to emerge a few hours
later hundreds, if not thousands, of light years away. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm curious why you built this catapult. <br>
TASH: Simple. I've been looking for a way to get home. <br>
KIM: We know the feeling. <br>
TASH: I'd been exploring an unstable wormhole. Before I knew it, I was
here and my home planet was there. I was facing a journey of at least
ten years. Instead, I decided to build a catapult. <br>
TORRES: Have you tested it yet? <br>
TASH: Two weeks ago I sent a probe nearly six hundred light years. But
it destabilised the core. I've been trying to fix it ever since. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We can send an Engineering team over to help you. <br>
TASH: No, no, it's too dangerous. I wouldn't send my own crew in there.
<br>
KIM: Then we could find a way to adjust the core reaction from here. <br>
TORRES: A few well-timed graviton pulses from our deflector dish might
do it.<br>
TASH: That's generous, but I have nothing to give in return. <br>
JANEWAY: We're not asking for anything in return. <br>
TASH: You could use the catapult after I've made my jump. It should
still be functional. A thousand light years won't exactly get you back
to Earth. <br>
KIM: But it would cut a few years off our trip. <br>
JANEWAY: If you're successful, and if I'm satisfied a jump would be
safe for Voyager, then we'll take you up on that offer. Thank you.
Let's get started.<br>(Seven has another night downloading lots of information into her brain, including the catapult schematics.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Janeway's
quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Good morning. <br>
SEVEN: Perhaps not. The alien, Mister Tash, is trying to deceive us. His
catapult is the same type of technology that was used to trap Voyager
in the Delta Quadrant five years ago. <br>
JANEWAY: I scanned the catapult myself. Sensors didn't pick up anything
unusual. You spent the night in your new alcove. <br>
SEVEN: Processing the same information and cross-referencing it with
Voyager's database. When the catapult destabilised yesterday,
Astrometric sensors recorded a momentary burst of epsilon radiation. <br>
JANEWAY: Unusual, but not unheard of. <br>
SEVEN: Epsilon radiation is one the by-products of a tetryon reactor.
According to your own entries in the database, your only encounter with
that kind of technology occurred five years ago in the Alpha Quadrant.
A coherent
tetryon beam locked onto Voyager, and you were hit by a massive
displacement wave, which pulled you across seventy thousand light years
in a matter of minutes. The source of that
tetryon beam was the Caretaker's array. Mister Tash claims that his
catapult will be able to do something very similar. <br>
JANEWAY: He didn't want us to send over a repair team. <br>
SEVEN: Out of concern for our safety. It's obvious he was trying to
hide his tetryon reactor. <br>
JANEWAY: The first time we met a Caretaker, we were pulled halfway
across the galaxy. The second time we were almost killed. I'm not eager
for a third round. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TASH: Is
this any way to treat a colleague? <br>
EMH: Not so much as a molecule of Caretaker DNA. <br>
JANEWAY: Thank you, Doctor. There's a tetryon reactor powering your
catapult. You didn't want us to find it, did you? Unless you answer my
questions, I'll resume course and you can ask somebody else for help. <br>
TASH: I acquired the tetryon reactor at great cost. This territory is
full of species who would do anything for such advanced technology,
including steal it. I apologise for the deception, but you do
understand. <br>
JANEWAY: We made an agreement to cooperate. I see no reason not to
continue. <br>
TASH: Thank you, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: (to Torres) Keep me informed on your progress. <br>(She walks away with&nbsp;Seven.) <br>JANEWAY: That
reactor had to come from somewhere. I can't just ignore the possibility
of a Caretaker nearby. Keep scanning. See what you can find. <br>
SEVEN: There is another possibility. The reactor may have come from the
same array that brought Voyager to the Delta Quadrant. <br>
JANEWAY: That's a long shot, Seven. <br>
SEVEN: Maybe not. Again, according to your own reports you believed the
only way to keep the array from falling into the wrong hands was to
destroy it. It's possible the destruction was incomplete. <br>
JANEWAY: And one of the reactors survived? We scanned for debris. There
was nothing left but some fused pieces of metal alloy. <br>
SEVEN: I wish to re-examine the sensor records from that event. <br>
JANEWAY: In case we were mistaken? <br>
SEVEN: Yes. <br>
JANEWAY: Go right ahead. </font></p>

COMPUTER: Particulate dust and metallic fragments composed of an
unknown alloy. Vapour composed of hydrogen, helium, mercury and argon. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
Commander, I've been reviewing the data on the destruction of the
Caretaker's array. Unfortunately, the sensor records are incomplete. <br>
PARIS: I don't doubt it. We were being attacked by the Kazon. Half the
ship's systems were down. <br>
SEVEN: A single Kazon vessel. <br>
PARIS: Armed to the teeth. <br>
SEVEN: Commander, you fired the tricobalt charge that destroyed the array. <br>
TUVOK: Correct. <br>
SEVEN: Under the Captain's orders. Did you also programme the charge? <br>
TUVOK: Yes. <br>
SEVEN: Under the Captain's orders as well? <br>
TUVOK: Not directly. I determined the yield. <br>
SEVEN: Twenty thousand teracochranes. <br>
TUVOK: That's correct. <br>
SEVEN: According to sensor estimates of the array's hull integrity, a
charge of half that yield would have been sufficient. <br>
TUVOK: The Captain wanted nothing left for the Kazon to use. I
calculated a yield certain to produce that result. <br>
SEVEN: Something may have escaped the blast. One of the tetryon
reactors. <br>
PARIS: But we scanned for debris. <br>
SEVEN: The charge you detonated tore an opening in subspace. <br>
PARIS: And that's where the reactor went? <br>
SEVEN: Yes. <br>
PARIS: How? <br>
SEVEN: It was pushed there by a tractor beam. <br>
TUVOK: Do you have evidence of a tractor beam? <br>
SEVEN: Perhaps. <br>
TUVOK: Speculation is not evidence. There was no tractor beam, because
there was no ship in the vicinity to generate one, unless you can prove
otherwise. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">NEELIX:
Looking for a midnight snack? <br>
SEVEN: I require information. I'm attempting to determine whether the
catapult technology was derived from the Caretaker's array. <br>
NEELIX: So I heard. A fascinating theory. It's got my mind spinning. <br>
SEVEN: How long were you in the vicinity of the array before Voyager
arrived? <br>
NEELIX: About a year. Kes was on a nearby planet and, er, we were
getting very close. <br>
SEVEN: Did you ever encounter the Caretaker directly? <br>
NEELIX: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. In my opinion, any being powerful
enough to grab ships from the other side of the galaxy should be
avoided. <br>
SEVEN: According to Voyager's database, he claimed he was searching for
a genetically compatible mate. Did you believe that explanation? <br>
NEELIX: I had no reason to doubt it, though it did seem a bit
excessive. I mean, all those ships. <br>
SEVEN: What happened to them? <br>
NEELIX: Well, after he sampled the crew's DNA he sent them back where
they came from, I suppose. You know, Kes always thought something more
was going on, but she had quite an imagination. <br>
SEVEN: Were there any other ships in the area after Voyager arrived? <br>
NEELIX: Only the Kazon. <br>
SEVEN: But the Caretaker could have pulled in another vessel. A cloaked
ship, perhaps. <br>
NEELIX: Seven, what are you getting at? <br>
SEVEN: A third ship, hidden from both Voyager and the Kazon. <br>
NEELIX: What was it doing there? <br>
SEVEN: Preventing the tetryon reactor from being destroyed. <br>
NEELIX: Kes was right. Something was going on. <br>
SEVEN: Voyager's sensor logs were damaged in the Kazon attack. I can't
be certain. <br>
NEELIX: Maybe I can help. The sensor records on my ship weren't
damaged. I can give them to you. <br>(Seven has another download session with Neelix's files.) </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
Computer, seal the doors. Deactivate all sensors within this room. <br>
COMPUTER: Acknowledged. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What's this about? <br>
SEVEN: I believe Voyager's presence in the Delta Quadrant is no
accident. You and the crew have been stranded here intentionally. <br>
CHAKOTAY: By whom? <br>
SEVEN: Captain Janeway. The Captain and Tuvok were involved in a
Federation conspiracy. They're in collusion with the Caretaker and
possibly the Cardassians. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I see. And the point of this conspiracy? <br>
SEVEN: I believe they're attempting to establish a military presence in
the Delta Quadrant. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's quite a theory. Perhaps you haven't heard of the
Jankata Accord? <br>
SEVEN: No species shall enter another quadrant for the purpose of
territorial expansion. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The Federation signed it, the Cardassians signed it, and
Captain Janeway would be the last person to violate it. <br>
SEVEN: Improbable as it may sound, I've found compelling evidence to
support my theory. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What kind of evidence? <br>
SEVEN: I've analysed over thirty million teraquads of data regarding
Voyager's activities over the past five years. It's quite clear that
we've been the victim of an elaborate deception. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't have the benefit of a cortical processor. Why don't
you give me the abridged version? <br>
SEVEN: In the months before Voyager's arrival, Neelix recorded the
appearance of fifty two vessels, including this one. <br>
CHAKOTAY: A Cardassian warship. <br>
SEVEN: A remarkable coincidence. Only days before Voyager's arrival, the
Cardassians were already in the Delta Quadrant. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The Caretaker was trying to find a mate, remember? He was
pulling ships from all over the galaxy. <br>
SEVEN: I'm familiar with the Caretaker's actions. In each instance, he
would examine the crews' DNA, and when he failed to find a genetic match
he would release the vessel. But in this instance, Neelix's sensors
indicated the ship vanished. Obviously, it was returned to the Alpha Quadrant. Why? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You seem to have all the answers. <br>
SEVEN: I believe the Cardassians were sent back to deliver strategic
information regarding the Delta Quadrant. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Conjecture. <br>
SEVEN: Extrapolation. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I can believe the Cardassians might be involved in this, but
not Starfleet. <br>
SEVEN: There are precedents for unauthorised missions of this type,
Commander. According to the Federation database, the Maquis were victims
of several of them. <br>
CHAKOTAY: All right, you've got my attention. You said that Tuvok and
Captain Janeway were involved. Tell me how. <br>
SEVEN: At the same time the Cardassians were meeting with the
Caretaker, your Maquis vessel was infiltrated with a Starfleet agent. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok. <br>
SEVEN: Your navigator. He guided your ship to prearranged coordinates
in the Badlands, where the Caretaker locked onto you. Once you were
pulled into the Delta Quadrant, Tuvok could have secretly transmitted
final instructions to the Caretaker. A short time later, Captain
Janeway guided Voyager to the same coordinates and was also pulled
into the Delta Quadrant. All of these events took place within a matter
of days. I find that suspicious. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'll admit the timing seems a little convenient, but that
doesn't mean there was a master plan. <br>
SEVEN: Why did the Captain destroy the array? <br>
CHAKOTAY: So the Kazon couldn't use it to attack the Ocampa. <br>
SEVEN: That's what she told the crew, but I believe she intended to
remain in the Delta Quadrant all along. If the Array had remained
intact, you and all the others would have insisted on using it to return
home. <br>
CHAKOTAY: She was keeping it from the Kazon. <br>
SEVEN: The Captain ordered Commander Tuvok to destroy the array. He
fired two tricobalt devices. Are those weapons normally carried on
Federation Starships? <br>
CHAKOTAY: No. <br>
SEVEN: Yet they were part of Voyager's arsenal. Why? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I can't explain that. <br>
SEVEN: I can. Neither phasers nor torpedoes are capable of creating a
tear in subspace. A tricobalt device is. As Tuvok detonated the device,
a cloaked ship locked on to one of the array's tetryon reactors and
pushed it through the tear into subspace, protecting it from the blast
and hiding it from Voyager's sensors. But the Captain and Tuvok knew
exactly where it was going. Once Voyager left the area, the reactor was
retrieved and began a similar journey, carried by a series of vessels
until it was finally delivered to Mister Tash. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Who used it to build the catapult. <br>
SEVEN: He was waiting here for Voyager, and for the final phase of the
mission. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Which is what, exactly? <br>
SEVEN: I don't think Captain Janeway is planning to use the catapult to
get Voyager closer to home. I think she's going to use it to bring in
more vessels from the Alpha Quadrant. If I'm correct, this region of
space will soon be occupied by a Federation-Cardassian invasion force. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You've uncovered some interesting facts. But your
interpretation is far-fetched. These are random incidents. Granted, some
of them are hard to explain, but there's no conspiracy here. <br>
SEVEN: Stardate 51008, Captain Janeway allows Kes to leave Voyager.
Neelix told me that Kes had suspicions about the Caretaker. Was the
captain trying to silence her? Stardate 51462, the Doctor's programme
is transmitted to a Starfleet vessel on the outskirts of the Alpha
Quadrant. An attempt by the Captain to contact Earth or a secret
communiqué informing Starfleet of her progress? Stardate 50984, Janeway
forges an alliance with the Borg. Stardate 51762, a cease-fire with the
Hirogen. Stardate 52861, a non-aggression pact with the Terkellians.
She called each incident diplomacy. I believe she was trying to
establish a tactical infrastructure in the Delta Quadrant. Over the
past five years, Captain Janeway has altered course two hundred sixty
three times in the name of exploration. In reality, she was mapping the
region and collecting strategic data regarding <br>
CHAKOTAY: I get the point. <br>
SEVEN: You still doubt my suspicions, but can you be certain I'm wrong? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Absolutely certain? No. <br>
SEVEN: Until you are, you mustn't allow Captain Janeway to retain
control of the catapult. </font></p>

CHAKOTAY: No, and I'm not going to. Not yet. <br>(Chakotay brings Torres up to speed on Seven's conspiracy theory.)<br>TORRES:
She's pulling your leg. It's got to be some kind of Borg practical
joke. <br>
CHAKOTAY: She wasn't joking. <br>
TORRES: A secret mission? Starfleet in league with the Caretaker? It's
ridiculous. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Ridiculous? Seven has some compelling evidence. <br>
TORRES: Well then, let's go to the Captain, get a straight answer. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Good morning, Kathryn. All systems are operational. The
crew's in good health. And by the way, is it true you've been lying to
us for five years? I'm not prepared to make that accusation, but I
can't ignore what I've heard either. <br>
TORRES: So what do you suggest? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I want you to delay those shield modifications. That'll give
me time to check Seven's database, take a look at the evidence myself. <br>
KIM: The Captain asked me to work with you on the shields. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That won't be necessary, Ensign. <br>
KIM: Oh, I don't mind. You know how eager she is to make that jump. <br>
TORRES: Harry, we're fine here. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Too many cooks, Harry. You know how it is. We'll let you know
when we're done.

SEVEN: Seven of Nine to Captain Janeway. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Go ahead. <br>
SEVEN: I need to speak with you in the Astrometrics lab. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: I'm on my way. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Astrometrics
lab]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
Computer, seal the door and deactivate internal sensors to this room. <br>
COMPUTER: Acknowledged. <br>
JANEWAY: Seven? <br>
SEVEN: I believe Chakotay and other members of your crew are involved
in a conspiracy to resurrect the Maquis rebellion. <br>
JANEWAY: Did Chakotay put you up to this? <br>
SEVEN: Voyager and the Federation itself are in grave danger. <br>
JANEWAY: Go on. <br>
SEVEN: I've concluded that Chakotay intends to use the catapult to
launch attacks against Cardassian and Federation starships. <br>
JANEWAY: Chakotay gave up his allegiance to the Maquis a long time ago.
What you're saying makes no sense. <br>
SEVEN: Improbable as it may sound, I found compelling evidence to
support my theory. In the months before Voyager's arrival, Neelix
recorded the sudden appearance of fifty two vessels, including this
one. <br>
JANEWAY: A Cardassian warship. <br>
SEVEN: I've analysed the hull geometry and warp signature. It was one
of the same ships that were pursuing Chakotay and his crew in the
region known as the Badlands. It was pulled into the Delta Quadrant by
the Caretaker during that engagement. According to Federation records,
that same Cardassian warship was found destroyed in the Badlands. The
investigation revealed that it was attacked by the Maquis. I believe
that for some unknown reason the Caretaker had sent this ship back to
the Alpha Quadrant, and that Commander Chakotay attacked the vessel
before it could reach its destination. He downloaded its computer core
and discovered the presence of the Caretaker's array. He realised that
the array could be used by the Maquis as a weapon, to launch surprise
attacks against Cardassian and Starfleet vessels. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, I commend you for your imagination, but Tuvok was a spy
on Chakotay's ship. If your theory were true, he would have known about
it. <br>
SEVEN: He does. Tuvok has been collaborating with the Maquis resistance
all along. <br>
JANEWAY: That's not possible, Seven. <br>
SEVEN: With Tuvok's assistance Chakotay plotted a course toward the
next likely appearance of the Caretaker's displacement wave, offering
his vessel as bait. His ploy almost succeeded, but the Caretaker was
more powerful than he anticipated. His crew was taken captive. A few
days later, Voyager arrived and facilitated their escape. Chakotay
seized that opportunity to make one last attempt to gain control of the array, but then you gave the order to destroy it. <br>
JANEWAY: Circumstantial evidence, not proof. <br>
SEVEN: Who carried out your order to destroy the array? <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok. <br>
SEVEN: Using what type of technology? <br>
JANEWAY: Tricobalt devices. <br>
SEVEN: He set the yield to twenty thousand teracochranes. It was enough
to tear an opening in subspace. A cloaked ship locked on to one of the
reactors, protecting it from the blast and hiding it from Voyager's
sensors. The reactor was retrieved and carried by a series of vessels
until it was delivered to Mister Tash, who was well compensated by
Chakotay to build the catapult. He was waiting here for Voyager so
Chakotay could complete the mission he was forced to abandon five years
ago. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd be willing to consider this theory of yours if I didn't
know Chakotay as well as I do. There is no one on this ship I trust
more. What you've done here is build what we call a house of cards. <br>
SEVEN: Stardate 48658. Commander Seska is revealed to be a Cardassian
spy. She defects to the Kazon and impregnates herself with Chakotay's
DNA. Was he unaware of the procedure, as he claims, or were they
working together, to create a new Kazon sect to capture Voyager?
Stardate 49522. Chakotay recommends establishing trade relations with
the Kolhari. Their technology uses
tetryon power cells. A simple diplomatic overture, or was he seeking a
source of energy for the catapult? Stardate 49571

I picked up a power surge coming from the Cargo bay. <br>
JANEWAY: I detected the same thing. You think it's the enhanced alcove.
<br>
CHAKOTAY: Could be. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's take a look. Are phasers standard equipment on board

CHAKOTAY: Must be. <br>
JANEWAY: The data buffer's been activated. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I wanted to make sure it wasn't malfunctioning. <br>
JANEWAY: You should be careful. Somebody might think you were
trying to delete a few files. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Why would they think that? <br>
JANEWAY: Some of those files could contain sensitive information. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If that's true, somebody might think you were trying to do
the same thing. <br>
JANEWAY: That catapult out there, it's a powerful piece of technology.
If the Maquis ever had access to something like it, they might have been
successful. <br>
CHAKOTAY: And if we had, your mission to the Delta Quadrant never would
have gotten off the drawing board. <br>

JANEWAY: My only mission is trying to get Voyager home. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Seven showed me the sensor records. I saw the tractor beam. <br>
JANEWAY: She showed me the same thing, but she implicated you in some
kind of Maquis plot. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Same evidence, two different theories. <br>

downloading Voyager's database. <br>

Captain. <br>(Janeway walks into a forcefield.)<br>SEVEN: You came here hoping to stop me. You'll fail. <br>
JANEWAY: Turn this ship around. That's an order. <br>
SEVEN: Your orders are irrelevant. I'm no longer under your command. You deceived me.<br>
JANEWAY: There is no conspiracy. There is no Maquis rebellion. The
Federation isn't planning to invade the Delta Quadrant. <br>
SEVEN: I realised that, because I finally uncovered your true objective.
<br>
JANEWAY: And what's that? <br>
SEVEN: Me. Stardate 32611, the Federation sends my parents to study the
Borg Collective. They know my family will be assimilated. That was
their intention. Stardate 48317, Voyager is sent to the Delta Quadrant
with orders to retrieve me. When they reach Borg space, Captain Janeway
negotiates an alliance with the Collective in exchange for information
regarding species 8472. They agree to give her Seven of Nine. Stardate
51030, Janeway extracts the implants from my body to remove any
knowledge I have of her agreement with the Borg. Stardate 53329,
Captain Janeway finalises plans to use the catapult to deliver Seven of
Nine to the Alpha quadrant, where Starfleet will dissect and
analyse the drone to gather tactical data to fight the Borg. I won't
allow you to complete your mission. If necessary I'll destroy the
catapult, and myself. <br>
JANEWAY: You're right, Seven. There is a conspiracy here. But I believe
it's a conspiracy of one. I've got a theory of my own. Your modified
alcove threw your synaptic patterns into chaos and your mind can't make
sense of all the information, so you're generating theory after theory
in an attempt to bring order to that chaos. <br>
SEVEN: Your reasoning is flawed. My alcove is functioning perfectly. <br>
JANEWAY: What about you? You're not a drone anymore. You can't always
predict how Borg technology will affect you. You should be in Sickbay,
not behind that forcefield. Let me help you. <br>
SEVEN: No. I don't believe you. <br>
JANEWAY: Of course you don't. Anything I say gets woven into your
paranoid conspiracies. But you should believe me, Seven, because I've
never lied to you, and I'm not lying to you now. You have to put your
doubts aside and trust me. Stardate 51030, Seven of Nine is severed
from the hive mind. The Captain tells her not to resist, that she'll
learn to accept her humanity. Seven complies, and slowly begins to
embrace her individuality. Does she regret that decision? Stardate
51652, the Captain encourages Seven to develop her social skills. Seven
insists it's a waste of time, but after further requests she pursues it,
and begins to develop her first human friendships. Did Janeway lead her
astray? Stardate 52840, the Captain orders Seven to study her parents'
journals. Seven claims they're irrelevant, but eventually she reads
them and rediscovers part of her own past. Stardate 52841, for the
first time, Seven tells the Captain thank you. <br>
SEVEN: It was Stardate 52842, oh six hundred hours in the mess hall. We
had just finished breakfast. <br>
JANEWAY: My mistake. Stardate today, Janeway beams aboard the Delta
Flyer. She reminds Seven of the bond that's grown between them. Seven
lowers the forcefield and she decides to come home. All I'm asking is
that you trust me again. <br>(Seven lowers the forcefield.)<br>JANEWAY: Delta Flyer to Voyager. Two to beam out. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Captain's log, supplemental. After further testing, we activated the catapult and
were hurtled across thirty sectors of space. In less than an hour, we
cut three years off our journey. I'm happy to say the Doctor has
repaired Seven of Nine's cortical processor and she's returned to duty.
