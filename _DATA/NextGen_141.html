Captain's log, Stardate 42695.3. We are the first manned vessel to
enter the Selcundi Drema sector. Unmanned probes have recorded unusual
levels of geological activity in all five planetary systems. I am
hoping the Enterprise will find the answer to this enigma.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Commander, I've been reviewing the unmanned
probe scans. At some point during the last one hundred and fifty years,
the fifth planet of Selcundi Drema has shattered, forming an asteroid
belt. <br>
RIKER: I'd call that geological instability. <br>
WORF: Is there any indication that this is the work of an unknown
intelligence? <br>
RIKER: This is geology, not malevolence. These planets live fast and
die hard. The question is, why?

TROI: No, I'll just watch you and be impressed. <br>
PICARD: An optimistic vote of confidence from a non-rider. <br>
TROI: You know, I never particularly thought of you as an animal
person. <br>
PICARD: Small animals, no, but horses. Computer, programme the holodeck
for a woodland setting, with a bridle path and an appropriate mount. <br>
COMPUTER: Type of mount? Andorian Zabathu, Klingon Sark <br>
PICARD: Horse. Earth horse. <br>
COMPUTER: Breed? <br>
PICARD: Arabian. The Arabs believed that Allah gathered the south wind
and made the horse. <br>
TROI: On the holodeck we've made that legend come true. <br>
PICARD: I like that. Oh yes, computer, English tack, and I will control
the animal myself. <br>
COMPUTER: Enter when ready.

TROI: So you like horses for the romance? <br>
PICARD: It goes deeper than that. A fine war mare would sleep in a
bedouin's tent, carry him into battle, feed his children with her milk.
There's a bond which is created by mutual need. Hello, beautiful. <br>
TROI: Now I understand. You don't want the comfort of a pet, you want a
companion. <br>
(Picard hands her his riding crop while he tacks up) <br>
PICARD: Thank you. I don't want to anthropomorphise anything. I seems
that some creatures have the capacity to fill spaces you never knew
were empty. <br>
TROI: I had a Betazoid kitten once. My mother and the cat reacted badly
to one another. <br>
PICARD: Sure you don't want to try? It's very relaxing. We can find you
something that will be quiet and gentle. <br>
TROI: No, I prefer a mode of transportation that doesn't have a mind of
its own. <br>
PICARD: Strange. I would expect Betazoids to be outstanding animal
trainers. <br>
TROI: We become too involved in the thoughts and shifting passions of
the beast. We lose our way and get swept up in emotion. <br>
PICARD: I should think the shifting passions of this beast would be far
more terrifying. <br>

RIKER: I'll need your advice and recommendations. As you know, I've
been given the responsibility of overseeing Wesley's education. To
further that goal, I would like to put him in charge of the planetary
mineral surveys. <br>
PULASKI: It's a big job with a lot of responsibility. <br>
RIKER: The game isn't big enough unless it scares you a little. <br>
LAFORGE: To do the job, Wesley's going to need a team. It takes command
presence to lead. Do you think he's ready for that? <br>
TROI: Leadership grows from self-confidence, which is also part of a
Starfleet officer's education. <br>
PICARD: All of this is true, but there is an old horse trainer's adage
about putting too much weight on a young back. We don't want him to
break under pressure. <br>
PULASKI: We seem to be shifting the focus here. Are we talking about a
young officer on the fast track to the Academy, or are we talking about
a young man that we are guiding through adolescence and into adulthood?
<br>
TROI: You can't guide someone into adulthood. The experiences are
unique to each person. Whether Wes succeeds or fails, he will learn
from the experience. <br>
PULASKI: I agree. I'm just questioning the speed at which we're moving.
<br>
LAFORGE: You think we're pushing him too hard? <br>
PULASKI: I think that's a valid concern. <br>
PICARD: Tempering is taken to extremes. <br>
PULASKI: He is a boy, not a sword. <br>
PICARD: Who will one day be a man and, to extend the metaphor, will
need a fine edge that won't dull at the first touch of resistance. <br>
RIKER: Sooner or later he'll have to feel the burden of command. Ensign
Crusher.

PICARD: Ensign, this is a serious responsibility. <br>

PICARD: These officers are here to assist you. Not judge, help you. You
should make use of them. They are a valuable resource. And by the way,
I respect an officer who is prepared to admit ignorance and ask a
question, rather than one who out of pride will blunder blindly

Hildebrandt for volcanology and geomechanics. I want Davies for

recorded. It's also laid down in a very unusual pattern. The crystals
are growing to form perfectly aligned lattices. <br>

ALANS: Which creates a piezoelectric effect. <br>
PICARD: In plain English, you're saying the dilithium is causing the
