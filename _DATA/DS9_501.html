<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Bashir hears raised voices from the O'Brien's
quarters, but when he stops to listen, Quark appears.) <br>
QUARK: Doctor? <br>
BASHIR: Oh! Hello, Quark. <br>
QUARK: Let me guess. Eavesdropping on the battling O'Briens? <br>
BASHIR: Don't be ridiculous. <br>
QUARK: Such language. I hope Molly's not around. <br>
BASHIR: You can hear what they're saying in there? <br>
QUARK: How could I not? <br>
BASHIR: What are they saying? <br>
QUARK: Let's use a little discretion, shall we? He's done something.
She's outraged. He thinks she's overreacting. She thinks he's trying to
run her life. Pretty boring actually, but to hear them you'd think it
was a matter of life and death. <br>
KEIKO: Hello, Julian. <br>
BASHIR: Oh. Hello. <br>
KEIKO: Quark. <br>
QUARK: Mrs O'Brien. <br>
(Keiko goes into her quarters.) <br>
BASHIR: I thought you said the O'Briens were arguing in there. <br>
QUARK: Not Miles and Keiko. The other O'Briens, Miles and Kira. <br>
BASHIR: What do they have to argue about? <br>
QUARK: Miles hid Kira's springball racket because she's carrying his
baby and he doesn't want her taking any risks, and she doesn't want him
controlling her <br>
BASHIR: What? <br>
QUARK: Keiko made them stop. Now they're in the 'let's talk this out
and share our feelings' part of the fight. Show's over. <br>
BASHIR: Oh, well. I mean, good. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: It is the power of his voice, the strength of
his intonation that make Barak-kadan a great singer. There are none
like him. <br>
DAX: None as boring anyway. He never varies his performance, by even a
half-tone. <br>
WORF: I prefer traditional opera performed in the traditional manner. <br>
DAX: You know, for a Klingon who was raised by humans, wears a
Starfleet uniform and drinks prune juice, you're pretty attached to
tradition. But that's okay. I like a man riddled with contradictions. <br>
(Worf sees Grilka (from <a href="449.htm" target="_blank">House
of Quark</a>) and her entourage come out of the airlock onto the
Promenade.) <br>
DAX: That's a welcome sight. The peace talks must be going well if the
Klingons are back on the station. Worf? <br>
WORF: Did you see her? <br>
DAX: The Klingon woman? <br>
WORF: She was glorious.

DAX: Her? She's okay. <br>
WORF: I have never seen such a woman. Who is she? What house is she
from? I do not recognise her family crest. <br>
(Grilka goes over to Quark, makes a pretence of going for her dagger,
then they embrace.) <br>
WORF: She's a friend of the Ferengi. <br>
DAX: Now I remember who she is. Her name is Grilka. And she's not just
Quark's friend. She's his ex-wife.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUARK: Maparian ale with just a hint of pazafer, as
I recall. <br>
GRILKA: You remember. I'm honoured. <br>
QUARK: How could I forget? You're the only Klingon I know who drinks
something besides bloodwine, or prune juice. <br>
GRILKA: Prune juice? <br>
QUARK: Forget it. To the House of Grilka. May it continue to be as
strong and proud as its lady is beautiful. <br>
GRILKA: You may not have been the ideal husband but you are an
excellent bartender. <br>
QUARK: I know of no greater compliment. So, what brings you to my
humble establishment? Business or pleasure? <br>
GRILKA: The recent hostilities between the Federation and the Empire
have been very costly to my family. We have suffered great losses in
ships, lands, warriors. <br>
QUARK: War. What is it good for? If you ask me, absolutely nothing. <br>
GRILKA: The financial cost was significant. <br>
QUARK: I have got an idea. Why don't I take a look at your financial
records? I know that's not why you're here. I'm sure it's simply a
social visit, but maybe I could help. <br>
GRILKA: Very well. If it pleases you, I will allow you access to the
records. <br>
QUARK: Thank you. <br>
(Grilka and Tumek leave, then Thopok puts his hands on Quark's
shoulders.) <br>
THOPOK: Hear this, Ferengi. Help Grilka and you live. Fail and I will
kill you myself. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAX: And even though it was an accident, Quark took
credit for killing Grilka's husband. <br>
WORF: Why? <br>
DAX: As a way of boosting business at the bar. And it worked. But then
Grilka kidnapped Quark and took him back to the Klingon Homeworld and
married him. <br>
WORF: Why? <br>
DAX: I'm getting to that. As a woman, Grilka was forbidden to lead her
House. By marrying Quark she was able to retain control through him.
Eventually, she convinced the Council to give her control and she
divorced Quark on the spot. As far as I know, that's the last time they
saw each other. <br>
WORF: A marriage of convenience. <br>
DAX: Certainly for Grilka. I'm not sure how convenient it was for
Quark. <br>
WORF: His opinion is of no consequence. He is unworthy of such a prize
as she. <br>
DAX: Worf, it sounds like you have got a bad case of par'Mach. <br>
SISKO: Is that contagious? <br>
DAX: Par'Mach is the Klingon word for love, but with more aggressive
overtones. <br>
SISKO: Love? Worf? <br>
DAX: Stranger things have happened. <br>
SISKO: Especially around here. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: This should alleviate Kira's sneezing. <br>
O'BRIEN: Should? <br>
BASHIR: Bajoran women have been sneezing their way through pregnancy
for over a hundred thousand years. You can't expect me to cure it
overnight. You know, I heard a rumour the Jerries may trying to cross
the Channel this evening. Maybe we should have a surprise waiting for
them. <br>
(O'Brien sniffs the respirator and sneezes.) <br>
BASHIR: Serves you right. <br>
O'BRIEN: I can't go to the holosuite tonight. Kira and I have some
things to work out. <br>
BASHIR: Still fighting, huh? <br>
O'BRIEN: Who said we were fighting? <br>
BASHIR: Word gets around. It's a small station. <br>
O'BRIEN: It's a huge station. <br>
BASHIR: Obviously not huge enough. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, for your information, we're not fighting. <br>
BASHIR: Glad to hear it. Bajoran takeo herbs for Kira's swollen ankles.
She'll need to dissolve them in some kind of fruit juice before
ingesting them. <br>
O'BRIEN: I hope they taste better than those makara herbs you gave her.
<br>
BASHIR: Are you sampling all her medications? <br>
O'BRIEN: No. Kira didn't like the taste. Oh by the way, I almost
forgot. She er, she has a rash on the back of her thighs. Do you have a
salve or something? <br>
BASHIR: How long has she had it? <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, I noticed it yesterday when I was helping her out of the
bathtub, so she's had it at least a day. <br>
BASHIR: Helping her out of the tub? <br>
O'BRIEN: She's living in my house. She's having my baby. <br>
BASHIR: So did you look? <br>
O'BRIEN: What? Oh, please. I was holding a towel up in front of her. <br>
BASHIR: How does Keiko feel about you helping Kira out of the tub? <br>
O'BRIEN: Keiko feels fine about it. You see, we are adults. We've
developed a close, mature relationship. <br>
BASHIR: I'm sure that Keiko and Kira have. But you? <br>
O'BRIEN: What about me? <br>
BASHIR: I bet you looked.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Grilka, Tumek and Thopok are at a table. Worf goes
over to Morn, who is signalling for a refill.) <br>
WORF: I will apologize for this at another time. You are in my seat! <br>
(Worf throws Morn off his seat and sits down) <br>
WORF: Bartender! Bloodwine! What is that smell? Is there a pile of
rotting forshak in here? <br>
(Worf glowers at Thopok.) <br>
WORF: Or is it you. Stand when I talk to you. Do you think it is funny?
<br>
(Worf goes to the table, throwing chairs out of his way.) <br>
TUMEK: Mev'Yap! Worf, Son of Mogh. Come, join me. <br>
(Tumek leads Worf to a quiet corner.) <br>
TUMEK: Challenging Thopok to a fight is a waste of time. Grilka cannot
mate with you, now or ever. Your House is dishonoured. Your name is a
curse. <br>
WORF: I meant no disrespect. <br>
TUMEK: You showed none. I'm sure your motives were honourable. Do not
let it trouble you too much. In truth, I doubt it would've been a good
match. <br>
WORF: Why? <br>
TUMEK: Have you ever pursued a Klingon woman? <br>
WORF: No. <br>
TUMEK: There's no shame in that. You were raised by Humans, you wear
their uniform, you accept their values. How could you know anything
about our women? <br>
WORF: You'd be surprised what I know. <br>
TUMEK: Perhaps. But we will not find out here. It is the wish of the
Lady Grilka that you leave us now, son of Mogh, and do not return. <br>
(That cracking sound is a breaking heart.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: I am a fool. <br>
DAX: You're in love. Which I suppose is the same thing. You're making
too much out of this, Worf. Tumek said Grilka wasn't offended. She was
probably flattered. <br>
WORF: There is no flattery in a great lady being courted by a traitor. <br>
DAX: Is that what's really bothering you? Or is it that Tumek said that
you didn't know anything about Klingon women, and you're afraid he's
right? <br>
(Quark enters) <br>
WORF: What do you want? <br>
QUARK: I want to talk to Dax if that's all right with you. I need help.
Grilka invited me to dinner and I need to brush up on Klingon manners
and protocol and all that. <br>
WORF: She invited you to dinner? <br>
QUARK: In her quarters. A private dinner. A very private dinner. <br>
(Worf gets up and stands by the bulkhead, sulking.) <br>
QUARK: What's wrong with him? <br>
DAX: He's having a bad day. <br>
QUARK: That's a shame. Well, when Grilka and I were married there
wasn't a lot of affection involved. So what does a Klingon woman expect
from a man? Are there any secret Klingon phrases I should know, or do
we just leap on each other like a pair of crazed voles? <br>
DAX: Quark, Klingon mating rituals are very involved. It's not just a
one night affair. <br>
QUARK: Two nights. Whatever. Look, I'm serious. Grilka and I, we have
something. I'm not sure what, but I want to pursue it. <br>
DAX: For sex? <br>
QUARK: No. Well, that too. But there's more. She's glorious. <br>
DAX: So I hear. Look, if you're serious about this, then you have to go
slow at dinner. No innuendo, no staring at her cleavage. <br>
QUARK: So what do I do? <br>
DAX: You talk. You ask her about her family's history and their
accomplishments. She'll consider this a great sign of respect. <br>
QUARK: Respect? Okay, okay, I can do that. Anything else? <br>
WORF: Grilka is from the Mekro'vak region. It is customary among her
people that the man to bring a leg of a lingta to the first courtship
dinner. Make sure it's fresh, as if you had just killed it. Then use
the leg to sweep aside everything on the table and declare in a loud
voice, 'I have brought you this. From this day, I wish to provide food
for you and your House. All I ask is to share your company and do
honour to your name.' <br>
QUARK: Then what? <br>
DAX: Well, either she accepts your offer or she has her bodyguard
shatter every bone in your body. <br>
QUARK: Sounds reasonable.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Kira is getting an ankle massage.) <br>
KIRA: Did your father just sit you down one day and say, right, Miles,
it's time to teach you about massaging pregnant women.' <br>
O'BRIEN: It's an O'Brien survival technique. My mother hated being
pregnant. My father's massages were the only things that kept her from
killing everyone. <br>
KIRA: Sounds like me. <br>
O'BRIEN: Pretty much. She didn't swear in Bajoran but she did like to
use what she called descriptive phrases. <br>
(Keiko enters with some clothes and a pair of boots.) <br>
KIRA: Are those my uniforms? <br>
KEIKO: Garak finished the alterations and sent these along. He
guarantees the insoles will help your feet. <br>
KIRA: Ow! Ow! Ow! <br>
KEIKO: That wasn't very convincing. I think she's actually enjoying it,
Miles. You'd better press harder if you want her to suffer. <br>
O'BRIEN: Harder it is. <br>
(Keiko leaves as O'Brien moves onto Kira's lower back.) <br>
KIRA: Ow. You're a sadist, Miles Edward O'Brien. Was your father this
cruel to your mother? <br>
O'BRIEN: Worse. I'd swear sometimes you'd hear her screams halfway
across Ireland. The neighbours didn't know whether to be worried or
titillated. <br>
(And onto the shoulders.) <br>
KIRA: Here. You miss Ireland? <br>
O'BRIEN: You know, if you'd asked me that a year ago, I would have said
no. But lately, I don't know why, I've been daydreaming about home.
Maybe I'm getting nostalgic in my old age. <br>
KIRA: You've got leave coming. Take three weeks and go. <br>
O'BRIEN: If I left, who'd give you foot massages? <br>
KIRA: Take me along. I can think of worse things than spending three
weeks in Ireland with you. <br>

QUARK: I'm not going to ask. Look, I came here to thank you for last
night. Grilka loved it. All of it. Everything I did, everything I said
it was perfect. <br>
WORF: So, I don't know anything about Klingon women. <br>
QUARK: She said I had the heart of a Basai Master, whatever that is. <br>
WORF: It is a poet. <br>
QUARK: A poet? I guess I can live with that. <br>
WORF: What else happened? <br>
QUARK: She spent about an hour talking about her family history. A
rather long and bloody tale, but what else is new? Then we ate the
lingta, which tasted really bad, listened to some noise which she
called Klingon music, and I left. <br>
WORF: A perfect evening. <br>
QUARK: Almost. Her bodyguard was giving me threatening looks all night.
<br>
WORF: That is to be expected. The idea of a Ferengi courting a great
lady is offensive. <br>
QUARK: You know, it's attitudes like that that keep you people from
getting invited to all the really good parties. <br>
WORF: The heart of a Basai Master. She said that? <br>
QUARK: Could I make that up? I'm telling you, Worf, she responded
perfectly. You really have the key to this woman's heart. The question
is, can you help me unlock it? <br>
WORF: Yes. I can. We have work to do.

Put yourself in this time, in this place. A thousand years ago, the
dawn of the Empire, five hundred warriors storm the Great Hall at
Qam-Chee. The city garrison fled before them. Only the Emperor Kahless
and the Lady Lukara stood their ground. It was here that they began the
greatest romance in Klingon history. <br>
QUARK: This is ridiculous! I'm surrounded by corpses, my shoes are
dripping with blood, and you want me to feel romantic? Why am I putting
myself through this? <br>

O'BRIEN: No. <br>
KIRA: Not at all. <br>
KEIKO: Good. Then it's settled. Miles, let's pack your bag.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUARK: What if I just do what I did the last time a
Klingon wanted to kill me? I throw my sword away, kneel down in front
of him and dare him to execute me. Yeah. He'll be humiliated and slink
away like a scalded targ. <br>
WORF: The only reason that worked was because Gowron stepped in and
restrained your opponent before he was able to kill you. No one will
stop Thopok. Dax and I aren't even able to attend. <br>
QUARK: So my choices are to not show up, be branded a coward and lose
Grilka, or die? <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
QUARK: Oh, come on now! There has to be another way out of this! You
people have rituals for everything except waste extraction. You must
have a ceremony or a secret handshake or something I can do. <br>
DAX: I have an idea. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Quark and Dax fighting with bat'leths. Notice
Quark is wearing one of those Ferengi head bands now. Worf is also
fighting, on his own, wearing a VR device. Dax is defeated.) <br>
DAX: Oh, congratulations. How do you feel? <br>
QUARK: Like a puppet. And I have some complaints for the puppeteer. You
nearly wrenched my arm out of its socket. <br>
WORF: The movement would not have hurt if you were in better physical
condition. <br>
QUARK: Exercise makes me sweat. <br>
DAX: You need to get some sleep. <br>
(She turns of a device under his head band.) <br>
DAX: If your body's tired tomorrow, Worf won't even be able to save
you. <br>
QUARK: Bedtime. <br>
(Quark leaves) <br>
WORF: I cannot believe the lengths I am going to for that Ferengi. I'm
practically giving him Grilka. <br>
DAX: What is it you see in her, anyway? I mean, she's attractive, but
other than that? <br>
WORF: It is everything about her. The way she carries herself,
confident and strong. She commands those around her. The proud tilt of
her head. The way her face betrays none of her true feelings. The power
of her voice. And her eyes, as hard as separ gemstones and twice as
sharp. <br>
DAX: It sounds like you're describing a statue. What would you do with
a woman like that? Put her up on a pedestal and clean her every week? <br>
WORF: You do not understand. <br>
DAX: If I were in your shoes, I would be looking for someone a little
more entertaining, a little more fun, and maybe even a little more
attainable. <br>
WORF: You are not in my shoes. <br>
DAX: Too bad. You'd be amazed at what I can do in a pair of size
eighteen boots.

win the favour of the Lady Grilka. <br>
TUMEK: The challenge has been given and accepted. Let no one interfere.

TUMEK: I've never heard of the Right of Proclamation. <br>

QUARK: I beg to differ! I am as proud of my heritage as you are of
yours and I will not be denied the opportunity to express myself
according to Ferengi custom. <br>
GRILKA: He has shown respect to our traditions. We will do the same.
What do you need to do? <br>
QUARK: I must make a speech. <br>

aquarium of my soul, seeking the kelp of discontent which must be cut
so that the rocky bottom of love lie in waiting with fertile sand for
the coming seed of Grilka's affection. And yet, does this explain my
need for her? No. It is like a giant cave of emptiness waiting for the
bats of love to hang by <br>

KIRA: Looks like it. <br>
O'BRIEN: Tell me about this house we're going to. <br>
KIRA: It's a gorgeous two hundred year old cottage filled with
antiques, sitting in the middle of a deep, dark forest. It's got three
fireplaces, two balconies <br>
O'BRIEN: I see. <br>
KIRA: It's twenty kilometres to the nearest neighbour, thirty to the
nearest town. <br>
O'BRIEN: Why am I not surprised? <br>
KIRA: It gets worse. There's a view. <br>
O'BRIEN: Of what? <br>
KIRA: Of the Holana river. You can see it from every room in the house.
At night, when the stars are out and you can only hear rushing water,
it may be one of the most romantic spots in all of Bajor. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's it. I'm not going. I don't care what Keiko says, I'm
not going. You go. I'll wait an hour and then I'll, I'll tell her that
you left without me, that there was a miscommunication about the
departure time. <br>
KIRA: You think she'll buy it? <br>
O'BRIEN: She'll probably accuse us of having another fight, of behaving
like children, but I can handle that. The important thing is that we
don't go anywhere near that place together. <br>
KIRA: You're absolutely right. In fact, I'm going to go to the capital
and see Shakaar. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's the best idea you've had all week. <br>

torn ligaments, strained tendons, numerous contusions, bruises and

man. <br>

WORF: You must have some idea. You were the <br>

WORF: Yes. And now there are questions that must be answered. <br>

one day at a time and see what happens? <br>
WORF: I do not like the uncertainty of that arrangement. <br>
DAX: One thing's for certain. You've stopped thinking about Grilka. </font>
