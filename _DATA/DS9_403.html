BASHIR: How did you know it was me? <br>
DAX: There are different ways to recognise someone. The rhythm of their
steps, for example. <br>
BASHIR: You are remarkable. <br>
DAX: Julian, you and I have to have a talk about Trills and
relationships. <br>
BASHIR: Fine. We'll do it over supper. Quark has found me this
delightfully dry champagne estate bottled on Korris One. <br>
DAX: Julian. <br>
BASHIR: What is this? <br>
DAX: An Altonian brain teaser. <br>
BASHIR: A brain teaser? <br>
DAX: A puzzle. <br>
BASHIR: A puzzle? I love puzzles. How does it work? <br>
DAX: It responds to neural theta waves. The goal is to turn the sphere
into a solid colour. <br>
BASHIR: That's all? <br>
DAX: That's all. I've been trying to master it on and off for, oh, a
hundred and forty years. Would you care to try? <br>
BASHIR: Yes. <br>
DAX: Just sit comfortably, and release your tension into my hands. <br>
Dax strokes his head) <br>
BASHIR: Your hands are cold. <br>
DAX: It's a peculiarity of the Trill. <br>
BASHIR: Cold hands, warm heart. <br>
DAX: Concentrate on the sphere. Clear your mind. This requires focus
and clarity of thought. <br>
BASHIR: I understand completely. What is that exotic scent you're
wearing? <br>
DAX: Focus and clarity of thought. <br>
BASHIR: Yes, yes, I have it. <br>
DAX: I'm going to release it to you now, okay? <br>
BASHIR: Okay. <br>
DAX: Computer, transfer control to second player. <br>
(The sphere goes kaleidoscope then disappears) <br>
DAX: I think your mind is still a little busy, Julian. <br>
BASHIR: So, are you free for supper? <br>

QUARK: A lot of new faces. <br>
ODO: The wormhole does bring them our way, doesn't it? <br>

ODO: And I'm sure you've already tried to sell it to a few of them. <br>
(Raised voices at an upstairs table) <br>
O'BRIEN: We made the decision together. <br>
KEIKO: Not true. That's not true. You decided and asked me to agree
with it. <br>
QUARK: Grapevine says Chief O'Brien and the missus are having problems.
<br>
ODO: I'll never understand the humanoid need to couple. <br>
QUARK: You've never coupled? <br>
ODO: Choose not to. Too many compromises. You want to watch the
karo-net tournament, she wants to listen to music, so you compromise.
You listen to music. You like Earth jazz, she prefers Klingon opera, so
you compromise. You listen to Klingon opera. So here you were ready to
have a nice night watching the karo-net match and you wind up spending
an agonising night listening to Klingon opera. <br>
KEIKO: That's exactly what I'm saying. <br>

growl) <br>

QUARK: I can so think about it. <br>
ODO: You might as well try to find a drink of water on the Yadozi
desert. Besides I'd say our new Commander is interested in her. <br>

SISKO: Well, some things are still the same. <br>
DAX: If you'd listen to me, you would eat steamed azna too. <br>
SISKO: Dax, did I ever tell you about the meals my father used to cook
for us when we were
children? <br>
DAX: All the time. <br>
SISKO: Every night in my house, my dad insisted that we have supper
together as a family. He would try out his new recipes on us. He used
to call us his test tasters. <br>
DAX: Steamed azna will put years on your life. <br>
SISKO: Dax, I don't want years on my life if I can only eat steamed
azna. Saut√©ed, rolloped, fricasseed, fine. But not steamed. I've missed
your steamed azna. <br>
DAX: You must miss Curzon, too. <br>
SISKO: He was, you were, are a mentor, another father to me. <br>
DAX: This happens to Trills, Benjamin. Sometimes, our friendships with
other species don't survive because of the change. <br>
SISKO: It won't be that way with us. It's just a little uncomfortable
right now. <br>

discomfort. Time can do the rest. <br>

IBUDAN: Yeah, well that's too bad, because I have every right to be

O'BRIEN: Not necessarily. <br>
KEIKO: I wish I knew the right thing to do. I'm just lost here.
Starfleet doesn't need a botanist on this station. <br>
O'BRIEN: Keiko, there's a whole new quadrant on the other side of the
wormhole, full of new plant life to explore. <br>
KEIKO: And ships going to explore it and I'm not on any of them. <br>

KEIKO: I don't need favours from you. I just need to be useful. <br>
O'BRIEN: Just think how much more attractive this place could be if you
planted some trees and flowers on the Promenade. You could even create
an arboretum from the new specimens we bring back from the Gamma

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: His name is Ibudan. He used to run black
market goods through here to the surface during the Cardassian
occupation, gouging his fellow man who needed medical supplies and so
forth. Some Bajorans actually considered him a hero, but I saw him let
a child die when the parents couldn't afford the drug that would've
saved her life. A few years back, he killed a Cardassian officer who
wanted a payoff to look the other way. He went to prison for murder. I
sent him there. <br>
SISKO: For murder? What's he doing out? <br>
ODO: The Provisional Government let him go. Killing a Cardassian isn't
considered much of a crime nowadays. <br>
SISKO: Doesn't sound like there's much we can do about it. <br>
ODO: I can get him off my Promenade. <br>
SISKO: If he hasn't done anything wrong, you can't just arbitrarily
force him to leave. <br>
ODO: Watch me. <br>
SISKO: Mister Odo, you're not going to take the law into your own
hands. <br>
ODO: The law? Commander, laws change depending on who's making them.
Cardassians one day, Federation the next. But justice is justice, and
as long as I'm in charge of security. <br>

DAX: Julian, Trills do not look for romance the way humans do. In fact,
we find it quite a nuisance. <br>
BASHIR: A nuisance? <br>
DAX: It's a weakness of the young, and although a Trill host may have
these feelings occasionally, it is our wish to live on a higher plane,
to try to rise above these kinds of temptations. <br>

succeed. <br>

logged Ibudan's check-in at seventeen hundred hours, sixteen minutes.
The suite was secured so no one else could enter. He ran Lauriento
massage holoprogram number one oh one A. Thirteen minutes later the
door opened for the second time, but since Ibudan obviously didn't
exit, we have to assume that's when the killer left. <br>
KIRA: Any evidence of a beam in during those thirteen minutes? <br>
ODO: No. <br>
KIRA: Well then how did the killer get in? <br>
SISKO: He might have entered the holosuite the same time Ibudan did. <br>
BASHIR: Cause of death's no mystery. The knife was thrust directly
between the left and right thoracic vertebrae, perforating the lower
ventricle of the heart. The murderer apparently had a decent knowledge
of Bajoran anatomy. <br>
SISKO: Doctor, I want you to look for evidence that could establish
someone was in here with him. <br>

O'Brien. When I found out what happened this morning on the Promenade <br>
JAKE: We weren't doing anything. <br>
SISKO: I don't want to talk about this now. It's this Ferengi boy, Nog.
Jake's won't be having anything more to do with him. <br>
JAKE: He's the only one here even close to my age. <br>
KEIKO: That's not exactly true, Jake. There are twelve other children
on board, ranging from eight to sixteen. The problem is there's no
structured activity for them. Don't you miss the schools you used to go
to, Jake? <br>
JAKE: No. I guess. Studying alone on the computer, it kind of gets
boring sometimes. <br>
KEIKO: You know, I've never actually been a teacher, Commander, but
it's something I've always thought about doing. <br>
SISKO: As a Starfleet Commander and as a father, I think this is a
terrific idea. What do you need? <br>
KEIKO: Some space. <br>
SISKO: We'll find it. <br>
KEIKO: Computers? <br>
SISKO: You'll have them. I hope you realise what you're getting
yourself into. I can't force the Bajora, the Ferengi or anyone else to
send their children to your school. And even if they do come, every one
has a different culture, a different philosophy. <br>

KIRA: You're saying nobody went into the room with him? <br>
BASHIR: Well, apart from those of us who were in there after the body
was discovered, this was the only DNA present, and we've identified it
as Ibudan's. <br>
KIRA: Wait a minute. Ibudan goes in the holosuite alone, locks the
door, nobody transports in, a few minutes later he's murdered. How is
that possible? <br>
ODO: It's not. Unless the murder was committed by someone who could get
through the cracks in the door. Say, a shape-shifter.

he was planning to meet with me at the time of the murder. No one
except a shape-shifter could get into the holosuite. And since I'd
obviously be called there after the body was discovered, traces of my
DNA wind up at the scene of the crime. <br>
KIRA: Do you have any kind of an alibi? <br>
ODO: Major, I have to return to my natural state every eighteen hours
to regenerate. To be quite honest about it, I was in a pail in the back
of my office when Ibudan was killed. <br>
KIRA: The killer might have known your regenerative cycle and planned
the murder accordingly. <br>
ODO: Like I said, a neat package. <br>
KIRA: Who might want to frame you for murder? <br>
ODO: I can think of about five hundred different people, but I haven't
seen any of them around the station recently. Do you think that
Federation doctor could do a sweep of Ibudan's quarters for me, see if
he can find out if somebody else was using that second bed? <br>

SISKO: The man we have in charge of a murder investigation is the prime
suspect, Major. Those people have a right to complain. <br>
DAX: Even if he's innocent, it could still seem like a conflict of
interest, Kira. <br>
KIRA: You're going to relieve him of duty. <br>
SISKO: I don't see any other choice. <br>
KIRA: He has been completely candid about this investigation. He could
have covered his tracks a half a dozen times already if he were guilty.
<br>
SISKO: I appreciate how you feel, but the decision stands. I'll inform
him myself.

ODO: Do you have any idea what they're from? <br>
BASHIR: I know exactly what they're from. A biological sample
container. I use them all the time. <br>
ODO: What would Ibudan be doing with a biological sample container? <br>
BASHIR: That I'm not so sure about, but when I analysed the fragments I
detected traces of a complex organic structure. <br>
ODO: Translate, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: It suggests Ibudan may have been conducting some sort of
medical experiment on board his ship. <br>
ODO: He wasn't a doctor or a scientist. <br>
BASHIR: Let's see what a standard electrophoretic analysis tells us. <br>
(Bashir touches a few buttons and looks at the monitor) <br>
BASHIR: What the? The complex proteins are breaking down into DNA
fragments. <br>
ODO: And what does that mean? <br>
BASHIR: It means we should set up a bio-regenerative field to
accelerate the cellular development. If I can reconstruct the DNA
sequence, it might just give us an idea what he was up to. <br>
