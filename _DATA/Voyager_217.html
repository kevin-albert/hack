NEELIX: Good afternoon, Ensign. How are we doing today? <br>
WILDMAN: Oh, we're doing just fine, thank you. <br>
NEELIX: Good, good. By the way, I was wondering if you'd take a look at
the thermal array in the kitchen. It overloaded this morning and
vaporised an entire pot roast. <br>
WILDMAN: I'd be happy to. <br>
NEELIX: Wonderful. I informed Ensign Kim about the problem hours ago,
and he still hasn't come down to fix it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Kitchen]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">WILDMAN:
He's been working on a problem with the structural integrity grid. I'm
sure he hasn't forgotten about you. <br>
NEELIX: If this thing doesn't get fixed soon, we'll all be eating cold
leftovers for dinner and who do you think the crew will blame? <br>
WILDMAN: Looks like you need a new set of anodyne relays. I'll go down
to Engineering and get some for you out of storage. <br>

Thanks. Oh, and while you're here, would you mind taking a look at the
replicator? It's been having trouble making anything with large amounts
of cellulose. <br>
WILDMAN: Of course. <br>
NEELIX: Cabbages, psyllium, green beans, celery and all. It all comes
out looking a touch too yellow. <br>
WILDMAN: I thought you didn't use replicated vegetables when you're
cooking. Always fresh, organic, from the airponic bay. <br>
NEELIX: Well, the yields have been a little low lately. Normally, I
would never dream of using synthesised veggies. <br>
WILDMAN: It looks like a malfunction in the power grid. Shouldn't be
too difficult. <br>
(Wildman gasps and sits down.) <br>
NEELIX: What's wrong? <br>
WILDMAN: I think I'm having a contraction. Oh, yeah! It's a
contraction, all right. <br>
NEELIX: That's wonderful. Labour can't be far behind. Let's, let's get
you to Sickbay. Try to breathe now. Deep, deep regular breaths. Not so
fast now. We're having a baby. </font></p>

it. <br>
EMH: Cervical dilation is at ten point two centimetres. Prostaglandin
levels are normal. Push, Ensign. <br>
WILDMAN: You push, damn it! I'm sick of pushing! <br>

PARIS: This is ridiculous. It's been seven hours. How long does it take
to deliver a baby? <br>
JANEWAY: As long as it takes, Mister Paris. <br>
TUVOK: Indeed. During the birth of our third child, my wife was in
labour for ninety six hours. <br>
KIM: Four days? <br>
TUVOK: I have learned that pregnancy and patience go hand in hand. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You know, I didn't expect to be this nervous. It's not even
my child. <br>
JANEWAY: In a way, this child belongs to all of us. It is the first
baby born on Voyager. I'm just not sure whether I should be welcoming
it on board, or apologising. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: Voyager isn't exactly anyone's idea of a nursery, and the
Delta Quadrant isn't much of a playground. <br>
CHAKOTAY: My father had a saying, Captain. Home is wherever you happen
to be. <br>
TUVOK: Captain, long-range sensors are picking up heavy subspace
communications ahead. They're Vidiian. <br>
JANEWAY: All stop. A ship? <br>
TUVOK: At least twenty ships within sensor range. I am also detecting a
G type star system with two inhabited planets. Life signs, Vidiian. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Sounds like we're headed right into their territory. <br>
JANEWAY: And I'm in no mood to donate any organs today. Options, Mister
Paris? <br>
PARIS: There's a large plasma drift bearing four zero mark seven. It
extends almost half the length of this sector. Interference from the
plasma should block us from their sensors. <br>
JANEWAY: Good thinking. Lay in a course at full impulse. Mister Tuvok,
deflectors at maximum. <br>

Oh! Oh, what was that? <br>
EMH: What's wrong? <br>
WILDMAN: A pain in my abdomen. It's different. Sharp. Oh, God! <br>
EMH: The baby has shifted position, and its exo-cranial ridges have
lodged in the uterine wall. This is a rare complication, but it's been
known to happen in human Ktarian pregnancies. <br>
KES: Can we reposition the baby? <br>
EMH: No. Its spinal column is too fragile. I don't want to risk nerve
damage. If we don't deliver the baby now, its ridges could perforate
the uterus and cause internal bleeding. Kes, prepare for a foetal
transport. </font></p>

She's right. The main sensor array is offline. Not a single burst was
fired. <br>

Good news, Ensign. Our baby is perfectly healthy. There's no sign of
any interspecies abnormalities. <br>

EMH 2: A figure of speech. I am, in part, responsible for bringing her
into the world. You may hold her now. <br>
WILDMAN 2: Hello there. <br>
(Janeway 2 enters.) <br>
JANEWAY 2: Congratulations, Samantha. She's adorable. Have you thought
of a name? <br>
WILDMAN 2: Not yet. I really thought it would be a boy. <br>
JANEWAY 2: Let me know as soon as you decide. I've been making a
blanket for her. All that's missing is an initial. Get some rest. How's
our other patient doing? <br>
EMH 2: She's still unconscious. <br>
KES 2: I ran a microcellular scan. We're almost identical in every way.
<br>
JANEWAY 2: Almost? <br>
EMH 2: There's a slight phase shift in her DNA. Do you have any theory
about where she came from? <br>
JANEWAY 2: Not yet. But I intend to find out. Can you wake her? <br>
EMH 2: I believe so. <br>
JANEWAY 2: Good, because I think she's going to have an interesting
story to tell. <br>
(Shortly afterwards, our Kes is awake.) <br>
KES: I was running through the corridor with my medkit. Deck fifteen.
And then suddenly I felt dizzy, and my vision started to blur. After
that, I don't remember anything, until you woke me up just now. <br>
KES 2: You were found unconscious down on deck fifteen, holding a
medkit. <br>
JANEWAY 2: We also found this lying next to you. It's a piece of
damaged conduit. Our analysis shows it's from Voyager, deck fifteen,
section twenty nine alpha, bulkhead zero five two. But there's no
damage to deck fifteen or anywhere else on this ship. <br>
KES: There was massive damage to deck fifteen. <br>
JANEWAY 2: The evidence would seem to suggest that you've come from a
different ship, a different Voyager. We did find a spatial rift on deck
fifteen. It's possible that it somehow connects us to this other
Voyager. <br>
EMH 2: If you're right, where is the other ship? A parallel universe,
another dimension, another point in time? <br>
JANEWAY 2: I'm not sure. Almost everything about the Voyager Kes
described is identical to ours. We've had similar experiences, similar
personal histories. We both entered a plasma cloud to avoid the
Vidiians. Both of our engines stalled as we left the cloud, which
caused both of our antimatter supplies to drain. And then we both
decided to keep our engines running by emitting proton bursts. But
after that, our experiences diverged. We started emitting the proton
bursts. They didn't. <br>
KES 1: Our ship was being damaged by proton bursts. We couldn't figure
out where they were coming from. <br>
JANEWAY 2: That's more than a coincidence. Janeway to Engineering.

CHAKOTAY 2: We analysed the sensor logs from our trip through the
plasma cloud. We couldn't find anything unusual until we ran a quantum
level analysis. Remember that subspace turbulence we hit just before we
left the cloud? <br>
JANEWAY 2: Yes. <br>
CHAKOTAY 2: Well, watch what happens. <br>
(Voyager's outline blurs.) <br>
KIM 2: At first, we thought it was a sensor aberration, but they were
in perfect calibration at the time. <br>
TORRES 2: So I ran a multispectral analysis on the subspace turbulence.
It was more than just turbulence. It was some kind of divergence field.
And the moment we passed through it, all of our sensor readings
doubled. Mass, energy output, bio-signatures, everything. Every
particle of matter on this ship seems to have been duplicated in that
instant. <br>
JANEWAY 2: So where is the other ship? <br>
KIM 2: As strange as it sounds, Captain, according to these readings,
another Voyager's right here, right now, occupying the same point in
space time we are. <br>
JANEWAY 2: Quantum theorists at Kent State University ran an experiment
in which a single particle of matter was duplicated using a divergence
of subspace fields, a spatial scission. <br>
CHAKOTAY 2: If the same forces were at work inside the plasma cloud,
they may have duplicated every particle of matter on Voyager. <br>
JANEWAY 2: Matter. But not antimatter. <br>
KIM 2: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY 2: In that Kent State experiment, they were able to duplicate
normal matter, but when they tried to duplicate antimatter particles,
the experiment failed. <br>
TORRES 2: So the antimatter on the ships wasn't duplicated. Both
engines have been trying to draw power from a single source of
antimatter. <br>
JANEWAY 2: Like Siamese twins linked at the chest, with only one heart.
<br>
CHAKOTAY 2: So what do we do? <br>
JANEWAY 2: I don't know. But whatever it is, we're going to have to
coordinate it with the other ship. Start working on a way to
communicate with them. <br>
TORRES 2: Right. <br>
JANEWAY 2: The only link we know of is on deck fifteen, the spatial
rift. We're going to need a way to send Kes back through safely. <br>

her from the spatial transition. <br>

Captain. The molecular signature of the second Voyager is slightly out
of phase with our own. I can't get visual, audio, nothing. <br>
JANEWAY 2: Have you tried remodulating the comm. frequency carrier? <br>
TORRES 2: Five times on forty seven different frequencies. <br>
JANEWAY 2: There has to be a way. If they were recalibrating their
carrier wave at the same time so we could match phase variance, would
that allow us to connect? <br>
TORRES 2: I think so, but in order to get them to do that, we'd have to
communicate with them first. It's the chicken and the egg. <br>
JANEWAY 2: Maybe we need something a little more primitive. Is there a
signal we could emit on all subspace bands just to get their attention?

what happened here. The damage from the proton bursts, Wildman's baby,
Kes disappearing. She even knew that when I was twelve years old, I
walked home in a thunderstorm over seven kilometres because I lost a
tennis match. <br>
TORRES: And her explanation of how the ship were duplicated, certainly
plausible. <br>
PARIS: If it is true, what do we do about it? <br>
JANEWAY: My counterpart has suggested we try to merge the two ships.
Recreate the subspace divergence field we passed through and then
depolarise it. <br>
TORRES: Both ships would have to send out a massive resonance pulse
from their deflector dishes at exactly the same time. <br>
CHAKOTAY: They may be able to do that, but we barely have enough power
for life support. How can we get enough to send an energy pulse of that
size? <br>
JANEWAY: We could evacuate all the crew to this deck, and cut off life
support everywhere else. Then we could divert all power to the
deflector dish. B'Elanna, re-establish the comm. link with the other
ship. <br>
JANEWAY 2 [on monitor]: This is Janeway. What have you decided? <br>

tells me that any attempt to disrupt the antimatter supply will destroy
us all. What about evacuating your crew to my ship? It might get a
little crowded, but we could manage. <br>
JANEWAY: We've been studying that theory. And my B'Elanna tells me that
sending any more than five to ten people through the rift would
radically alter the atomic balance of the two Voyagers. We'd both be
destroyed. Captain, I think you should return to your ship and run a
metallurgical analysis. Find out the precise phase modulation of your
hull. I'll do the same here. Maybe we can find a way to realign the

TORRES: Ah, it's about time. <br>
TUVOK: Tuvok to Janeway. Ensign Kim has made it through the rift, with
the infant. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Acknowledged. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, the Vidiian ship has been destroyed. So has the
other Voyager. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Captain's
log, stardate 49548.7. There are no signs of any pursuing Vidiian
vessels, and we have resumed a course toward home. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TUVOK:
Repair efforts are underway. Lieutenant Torres estimates we'll be able
to return to the Bridge within three days. <br>
JANEWAY: Good. I'm not sure how much longer B'Elanna can tolerate my
standing over her shoulder in Engineering. Tuvok, is there something on
your mind? <br>
TUVOK: I am curious, Captain. Before the Vidiians attacked, when you
were in disagreement with the other Captain about <br>
JANEWAY: Would I have given the order to self-destruct our ship? I've
gone over that moment a thousand times in my mind. The truth is, yes, I
would have given the order. But I will admit, there was a part of me
that could see her point of view. <br>
TUVOK: One could say that you were both the doubter and the doubted. I
do not envy the paradox of logic you were faced with in that situation.
<br>
JANEWAY: Neither did I. And neither did she. <br>
(Tuvok leaves.) <br>
WILDMAN: Thank you. Thank you so much. <br>
KIM: You're welcome. But you should also thank the Doctor. It was his
counterpart who saved her from the Vidiians. <br>
EMH: I'm not surprised. I am programmed to be heroic when the need
arises. By the way, Ensign, this other Doctor, did he have a name? <br>
KIM: I really didn't have time to ask. <br>
JANEWAY: Am I allowed to go back to my temporary Bridge now, Doctor? <br>
EMH: By all means. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
It's good to have you back, Ensign. <br>
KIM: Thank you, I think. <br>
JANEWAY: Something wrong? <br>
KIM: I'm not sure. I mean, this isn't really my ship, and you're not
really my captain, and yet you are, and there's no difference. But I
know there's a difference. Or is there? It's all a little weird. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Kim, we're Starfleet officers. Weird is part of the
job. </font> </p>
