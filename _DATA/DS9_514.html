spins and not a single dabo so far. The pot is growing and someone's
going to be a big winner. <br>
(We pull away as she gives a little wave to Rom at the bar.) <br>
ROM: Today's the day, brother. I'm really going to do it this time. <br>
QUARK: You've been saying that for weeks. <br>
ROM: I've been waiting for the right moment. And this is it. <br>
QUARK: Now? <br>
ROM: It's perfect. She's about to go on her break, and when she does,
she'll come over here to say hi, to me like she always does, and that's
when I'll do it. <br>
QUARK: Okay, let's hear it. <br>
ROM: I, er, Leeta, would you like, maybe, to one night, soon, to maybe?
<br>
QUARK: Rom, you're a regular poet. <br>
ROM: I can do better. <br>
QUARK: Prove it. <br>
LEETA: Hi, Rom. <br>
(She stands close, knees slightly bent so they can look straight into
each others eyes better.) <br>
ROM: Hello, Leeta. Bye. <br>
LEETA: I must be doing something wrong. <br>
QUARK: I don't know, Leeta. Maybe he's just not interested in you. <br>
LEETA: Well, I know he likes me. <br>
QUARK: Likes you, yes. But he's an engineer, a problem solver. He needs
a woman with a body and brains. <br>
LEETA: I have brains. <br>
QUARK: Of course you do, honey. That's why I hired you. Now eat up and
then take those brains back to the dabo wheel where the customers can
get a good long look at them. <br>
BASHIR: Triple twenty! He's back in the zone today. <br>
O'BRIEN: I never really left it. Just been giving you a chance to get
even. <br>
BASHIR: Thank you, but I don't need your charity. Another game? <br>
O'BRIEN: Maybe one. I promised Molly I'd do some colouring with her
this afternoon. With all this attention focused on the baby, I don't
want her to start feeling that we've forgotten about her. <br>
BASHIR: A father's work is never done. <br>
O'BRIEN: You said it. Still, it's worth it. You should give it a try
sometime. <br>
BASHIR: Me? No. <br>
O'BRIEN: Why not? I bet you'd make a great father. <br>
BASHIR: I'm not exactly the family type. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Doctor Bashir, I presume? <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000585/" target="_blank">Robert
Picardo</a>, this time playing the creator of the Voyager EMH.) <br>
BASHIR: That's me. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: I'm Louis Zimmerman, Director of Holographic Imaging and
Programming at the Jupiter Research Station. And I'm here to make you
immortal.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A ship that looks very like Voyager is leaving the
station.) <br>
ZIMMERMAN: You're familiar, of course, with the Emergency Medical
Holographic Programme? <br>
SISKO: I've heard of it. It's a hologram designed to provide assistance
during emergencies in Sickbay. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: It does much more than provide assistance. <br>
BASHIR: A holographic doctor can literally replace a starship's medical
officer during an emergency. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: I'm surprised you don't have one on the station. <br>
SISKO: The station facilities are Cardassian in origin. Most of our
equipment is incompatible with Federation technology. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: How unfortunate for you. In any case, the original EMH was
designed for short-term use only. But now Starfleet has requested a
programme designed to operate as full-time doctor. <br>
SISKO: Full time? You're not talking about replacing real doctors? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: No, no, of course not. Why is everyone so worried about
holograms taking over the universe? <br>
BASHIR: There are many situations where a holo-doctor could be more
beneficial than a humanoid. Research outposts, subspace communication
stations, long-range exploratory vessels. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: In short, anywhere that life-support or living space is at a
premium and where the primary mission does not require the doctor to
leave Sickbay. <br>
SISKO: I see. And they want to model this new EMH programme after
Doctor Bashir. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Technically, it is a LMH. Long-term Medical Holographic
Programme. And yes, Starfleet Medical has selected Doctor Bashir to
provide the template. <br>
SISKO: Who was the template for the EMH? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Me. It was my programme after all. It only seemed logical to
use myself as a model. <br>
SISKO: Of course. This must be quite an honour. <br>
BASHIR: Yes, it is quite a feather in my cap, sir. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: It is nothing less than a shot at immortality. The original
EMH programme will probably still be in use for decades to come. The
LMH will undoubtedly last far longer than that. That is, if I can work
out certain technical problems. Now, I'll need to remain here for at
least three weeks. I'll need quarters, access to your main computer, a
technician to install my equipment, a high-speed data link with my lab.
<br>
SISKO: Doctor, my first officer, Major Kira, will see to all your
needs. Congratulations, Doctor. I know I speak for everyone on the
station when I say we're really very proud of you. <br>
BASHIR: Thank you, sir. Thank you. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Let's go.

the ceiling.) <br>
BASHIR: This is a long questionnaire. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: I pride myself on my attention to detail. <br>
BASHIR: Let's see. Compare and contrast your eating habits at age five
with those at ages ten, fifteen, twenty, and twenty five? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: It will be necessary for the holo doctor to interact
naturally with patients for weeks, possibly even months. The doctor
will be expected to share amusing anecdotes, extend sympathy, swap
dirty jokes and even have culinary opinions formed by experience. <br>
O'BRIEN: You mean this programme is going to have all of his personal
likes and dislikes? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: That is why we bother to choose a human template in the
first place. <br>
O'BRIEN: Wow, think of it, Julian. If this thing works, you'll be able
to irritate hundreds of people you've never even met. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: If you two could suspend your oh so amusing banter for the
moment, I'd like to begin the optical parameter scans. <br>
BASHIR: What do you want me to do? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Just stand there and look like a doctor. If you can.

LEETA: Dabo! <br>
ZIMMERMAN: We don't have anything like this on Jupiter Station. Or like
her. <br>
BASHIR: She's beautiful, isn't she? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Who is she? <br>
BASHIR: Her name's Leeta. My ex-girlfriend. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Who broke it off? <br>
BASHIR: She did. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Oh, I like her already. <br>
(Leeta looks up, sees Zimmerman looking down and smiles.) <br>
ZIMMERMAN: I think I'll have to add her name to my list of interviews. <br>
BASHIR: Interviews? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: I'll be conducting in-depth interviews with your friends,
colleagues, family members, in order to build a more rounded
psychological profile for the LMH. <br>
BASHIR: I see. Well, regarding my family members, would you could
refrain from <br>
ODO: Excuse me for interrupting, Doctor, Doctor. The Antidean transport
wishes to leave the station a day early. Their cargo is still under
quarantine. If you could issue a health certificate. <br>
BASHIR: Now? <br>
ODO: It would expedite matters. <br>
BASHIR: All right. I'll meet you in cargo bay three in ten minutes. <br>
ODO: Thank you, Doctor. Doctor. <br>
(Odo leaves.) <br>
BASHIR: Well, duty calls. I wonder if you could do a favour and
consider not interviewing my parents? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Why? <br>
BASHIR: Well, to be blunt, we're not close, we haven't been for many
years, and I would consider it a personal favour if you would er, sort
of, leave my parents out of it. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: I see. Well, I certainly understand. <br>

Does it meet with your approval? <br>
BASHIR: Yeah, it looks all right. Except for the eyes. They seem a
little dead. They don't have that certain sparkle,
that zest for life that greets me in the mirror every morning. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: This is a test run. I can assure you that the final product
will be zesty. <br>
BASHIR: Does it talk? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Not yet. First I have to load the LMH with the basic
database and software configurations of the original programme.
Computer, activate the EMH. <br>
EMH: Please state the nature of the medical emergency. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: This is a level three diagnostic. <br>
EMH: I understand. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: Diagnostics look good. Beginning data transferral. <br>
EMH: Data transferral? Am I being replaced? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: You're being supplemented by a new long-term programme. <br>
EMH: By him? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: There. Transfer's complete. <br>
HOLO-BASHIR: Please state the nature of the medical emergency. <br>
EMH: Oh, that's original. He doesn't even look old enough to be a
doctor. <br>
HOLO-BASHIR: If you'd like my advice, you should delete this programme.
Now that I'm here, why would you need an archaic piece of software like
him? <br>
EMH: Archaic? <br>
ZIMMERMAN: We can discuss this at another time. <br>
EMH: Listen. <br>
(EMH is deactivated.) <br>
BASHIR: He doesn't sound like much me. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: I'm sorry. Too zesty for you? <br>
BASHIR: Actually, he sounds more like you. <br>
ZIMMERMAN: As I said, I've loaded the LMH with the basic EMH software
package. We'll have to build a new set of algorithms based on your
scintillating personality. <br>
HOLO-BASHIR: I hope you're more interesting than you seem. I'd hate to
be boring. <br>

friends have to say.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ZIMMERMAN [OC]: What were your initial impressions
of Doctor Bashir? Good and bad. <br>
SISKO: Young, eager, ambitious. He was fresh out of medical school,
looking forward to his first taste of frontier medicine. Sometimes he
let that natural impulse override his sense of decorum. <br>
ZIMMERMAN [OC]: You mean he was difficult. <br>
JAKE: No. But sometimes he could give you way too much information. <br>
ZIMMERMAN [OC]: Could you elaborate on that? <br>
KIRA: Sometimes he just didn't know when to shut up. <br>
ZIMMERMAN [OC]: Are you implying that he harassed you with unwanted
advances? <br>
DAX: No. But he was very persistent. <br>
ZIMMERMAN [OC]: I see. Could you be more specific? <br>
(Morn shrugs.) <br>
ZIMMERMAN [OC]: You're not being very helpful. <br>
WORF: I do not like doctors. Any doctors. <br>
ZIMMERMAN [OC]: You can rest assured that I will keep anything you say
in the strictest confidence. <br>
O'BRIEN: You're sure about that? I wouldn't want this to get back to
Julian. <br>
ZIMMERMAN [OC]: You have my word. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, the truth is he's an extraordinary person. A real sense
of honour and integrity, great sense of humour, warm, caring. You're
sure he's not going to read this? <br>
ZIMMERMAN [OC]: Positive. <br>

Sometimes I think I'm the happiest person. Stroll along the Promenade,
maybe have a little. <br>
LEETA: You want a real game, try dom-jot. If I ran this place, we'd
have three dom-jot tables and two prayko alleys. And I'd make sure the
customers had a lot more fun. Quark is a lot of things, but he's not
fun. I'm fun. <br>

landscape architecture, designing public spaces, parks mostly. I love
the idea of working on projects that thousands of people will enjoy
long after I'm gone. They're my legacy, my gift to succeeding
generations. Aside from Jules here, of course. <br>

a complete psychological profile of me. He's going to be asking you all
sorts of questions. Try to keep your answers as brief and to the point
as you can. You don't want to give him any openings to probe into any
awkward areas. <br>

destroyed if Doctor Zimmerman gets wind of our little secret. <br>

AMSHA: Your father has something he wants to say. Richard? <br>
RICHARD: It's a stressful time for all of us and maybe I said some
things I shouldn't have. <br>
AMSHA: What he's trying to say is, we would never do anything to
jeopardise your career. <br>
RICHARD: And just so there's no misunderstanding, I give you my word
that at no time in our interview with Doctor Zimmerman will we ever
mention or even hint at the fact that you were genetically enhanced as
a child. <br>
AMSHA: Jules, you can trust us. Your father and I have kept the secret
of your DNA resequencing for almost twenty five years and we're not
going to let it out now. <br>
RICHARD: But I would just add that, despite what the authorities would
like us to believe, genetic engineering is nothing to be ashamed of.
You're not any less human than anyone else. In fact, you're a little
more. <br>
AMSHA: We didn't come here to start another fight. Let's just try to
get through this, all right? <br>
BASHIR: All right. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: I can't believe you set them up like that! <br>
O'BRIEN: We didn't set them up. They just happened to walk in when the
programme
was running. Zimmerman thought it would be a idea to test the
programme's ability to cope with an unexpected situation. <br>
BASHIR: And you let it go on? You let them stand there and make fools
of themselves while the two of you sat in the back room and laughed? <br>
O'BRIEN: Look, I'm sorry about this. I wish it had never happened, but
it has and now we've got a problem. <br>
BASHIR: I don't want to talk about it. <br>
O'BRIEN: Julian, Zimmerman is going to file a report saying that Doctor
Bashir is unsuitable for computer modelling because of his suspected
genetically enhanced background. Do you know what's going to happen
when that report gets back to Starfleet Medical? <br>
BASHIR: There's going to be a formal investigation which will lead to
my eventual dismissal from the service. <br>
O'BRIEN: Then it's true? You're <br>
BASHIR: The word you're looking for is unnatural, meaning not from
nature. Freak or monster would also be acceptable. I was six. Small for
my age, a bit awkward physically, not very bright. In the first grade,
while the other children were learning how to read and write and use
the computer, I was still trying to tell a dog from a cat, a tree from
a house. I didn't really understand what was happening. I knew that I
wasn't doing as well as my classmates. There were so many concepts that
they took for granted that I couldn't begin to master and I didn't know
why. All I knew was that I was a great disappointment to my parents. I
don't remember when they made the decision, but just before my seventh
birthday we left Earth for Adigeon Prime. At first, I remember being
really excited at seeing all the aliens in the hospital. Then they gave
me a room and began the treatments, and my entire world began to
change. <br>
O'BRIEN: What were the treatments? Some kind of DNA recoding? <br>
BASHIR: The technical term is 'accelerated critical neural pathway
formation.' Over the course of the next two months, my genetic
structure was manipulated to accelerate the growth of neuronal networks
in my cerebral cortex, and a whole new Julian Bashir was born. <br>
O'BRIEN: In what way did they change you? <br>
BASHIR: Well, my mental abilities were the top priority, of course. My
IQ jumped five points a day for over two weeks. Followed by
improvements in my hand-eye coordination, stamina, vision, reflexes,
weight, height. In the end, everything but my name was altered in some
way. When we returned to Earth, we even moved to a different city, I
was enrolled in a new school using falsified records my parents
obtained somewhere. Instead of being the slowest learner, I was the
star pupil. <br>
O'BRIEN: And no one ever suspected? <br>
BASHIR: Oh, there's no stigma attached to success, Chief. After the
treatments, I never looked back. But the truth is I'm a fraud. <br>
O'BRIEN: You're not a fraud. I don't care what enhancements your
parents may have had done. Genetic recoding can't give you ambition, or
a personality, or compassion or any of the things that make a person
truly human. <br>
BASHIR: Starfleet Medical won't see it that way. DNA resequencing for
any reason other than repairing serious birth defects is illegal. Any
genetically enhanced human being is barred from serving in Starfleet or
practising medicine. <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't there's been a case dealing with any of this in a
hundred years. You can't be sure how they'll react. <br>
BASHIR: Oh, I am sure. Once the truth comes out I'll be cashiered from
the service. It's that simple. <br>
O'BRIEN: There must be something we can do. We can't just give up. <br>
BASHIR: There is something I can do. Resign before Doctor Zimmerman
files his report. <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh, Julian. <br>
BASHIR: It's over, Miles. I always knew this could happen. Now it has.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to be alone.

ROM: I should have told her how I felt. <br>
QUARK: Thank the Nagus that you didn't. Remember what happened with
Nog's mother? Yeah, don't want to think about her, do you. Let me
refresh your memory. You signed a standard five year marriage contract
with Prinadora's father because you wanted to have a child. A simple
everyday business deal. But then you fell in love with your wife and
wanted to extend the contract. And you were so in love that you never
bothered to read the extension before signing it. So in the end, her
father swindled you out of all your money. Prinadora left you for a
richer man and you got stuck with Nog. Hooray for romance. <br>
ROM: Leeta is not Prinadora. <br>
QUARK: She's a female, Rom. And the one constant in the universe is,
females are trouble. Look, if you're lonely I've got a new holosuite

down, that's for sure. I'll arrange for legal counsel. We're going to
fight this all the way to the Federation Supreme Court. <br>
BASHIR: We can't fight this. <br>
RICHARD: You'd better change that attitude right now if you want to
hang on to your career. <br>
AMSHA: Jules, listen to your father. He's trying to help you. <br>
BASHIR: Neither of you is listening to me. I don't want to drag this
through the courts. <br>
RICHARD: We're a little beyond worrying about your wants, Jules. We
have a serious problem here. We have to stop the whining and
concentrate on coming up with a new plan. <br>
BASHIR: A new plan. Yes, let's come up with a new plan. That's the way
we do things in this family, isn't it? We don't face our problems, we
come up with new plans. Don't like your job? Well move along to the
next one. Don't like the law? Well, find a way to get around it. But
whatever you do, do not accept responsibility. <br>
RICHARD: All those gifts, all those accomplishments, and you still want
to behave like a spoiled child. Well you'd better grow up right now or
you're going to lose everything! <br>
BASHIR: You mean you're going to lose everything. You're going to lose
your only real accomplishment in this life. Me. You said before, I'm
your legacy, your proud gift to the world. Well, father, your gift is
about to be revealed as a fraud, just like you. <br>
RICHARD: I'm still your father, Jules, and I will not have you talk to
me like that. <br>
BASHIR: No, you used to be my father. Now, you're my architect. The man
who designed a better son to replace the defective one he was given.
Well, your design has a built-in flaw. It's illegal. <br>
RICHARD: You're so smart. You know so much that you can stand there and
judge us. But you're still not smart enough to see that we saved you
from a lifetime of remedial education and underachievement! <br>
BASHIR: You don't know that. You didn't give me a chance. <br>
RICHARD: You were falling behind. <br>
BASHIR: I was six years old. You decided I was a failure in the first
grade. <br>
RICHARD: You don't understand, Jules. You never did. <br>
BASHIR: No, you don't understand. I stopped calling myself Jules when I
was fifteen and I'd found out what you'd done to me. I'm Julian. <br>
RICHARD: What difference does that make? <br>
BASHIR: It makes every difference, because I'm different! Can't you see
that? Jules Bashir died in that hospital because you couldn't live with
the shame of having a son who didn't measure up! <br>
AMSHA: That's not true! We were never ashamed of you. Never. <br>
BASHIR: I'm sorry, mother, but the truth is <br>
AMSHA: You don't know. You've never had a child. You don't know what
it's like to watch your son. To watch him fall a little further behind
every day. You know he's trying, but something's holding him back. You
don't know what it's like to stay up every night worrying that maybe
it's your fault. Maybe you did something wrong during the pregnancy,
maybe you weren't careful enough, or maybe there's something wrong with
you. Maybe you passed on a genetic defect without even knowing it. <br>
RICHARD: Amsha <br>
AMSHA: No, this is important. You can condemn us for what we did. You
can say it's illegal or immoral or whatever you want to say, but you
have to understand that we didn't do it because we were ashamed, but
because you were our son and we loved you. <br>
(Bashir and Amsha hug.) <br>
AMSHA: What do you want us to do? <br>
BASHIR: Nothing. I'm going to visit Captain Sisko in the morning to
explain the situation to him and tender my Starfleet resignation. <br>
AMSHA: Are you certain this is what you want? <br>

BASHIR: Admiral. <br>
BENNETT: Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: May I ask what's going on? <br>
SISKO: Your parents came to me this morning. They explained the

RICHARD: Two years. It's a minimum security penal colony in New
Zealand. <br>

illegal genetic engineering and in exchange you stay in the service. <br>

who took you to Adigeon Prime. I'm the one who should take
responsibility for it. <br>
AMSHA: Let him do this, Julian. <br>
BASHIR: Two years? Isn't that a bit harsh? <br>
BENNETT: I don't think so. Two hundred years ago we tried to improve
the species through DNA resequencing, and what did we get for our
trouble? The Eugenics Wars. For every Julian Bashir that can be
created, there's a Khan Singh waiting in the wings. A superhuman whose
ambition and thirst for power have been enhanced along with his
intellect. The law against genetic engineering provides a firewall
against such men and it's my job to keep that firewall intact. I've
made my offer. Do you accept? <br>
RICHARD: Yes. <br>

arrive on Earth. <br>
