GARAK: Ah, Constable. How good of you to stop by. <br>
(Garak glances towards the changing room.) <br>
ODO: A shoplifter? <br>
GARAK: Excuse me? <br>
ODO: Is something wrong? <br>
AROYA [OC]: Here I come. <br>
(A Bajoran woman comes out, trying on a new dress.) <br>
AROYA: What do you think? <br>
GARAK: A thing of beauty is a joy forever. <br>
AROYA: Oh, well then, put it on my account. I'll wear it to work. <br>
GARAK: A splendid idea. Ah, Security Chief Odo, I'd like to introduce
you to Chalan Aroya, one of my best customers. <br>
AROYA: I own the Celestial Cafe, the new Bajoran restaurant overlooking
the Promenade. <br>
ODO: I'm familiar with it. <br>
AROYA: I watch you walk by every morning when you're on patrol. Oh nine
thirty seven. You're very precise. <br>
ODO: How nice of you to notice. <br>
AROYA: I was hoping one day you might stop in when you're not working. <br>
ODO: I don't eat. <br>
AROYA: I do, and I hate to eat alone. Think about it. Oh, and next time
you're on the second level, don't forget to say hello. <br>
(Aroya leaves) <br>
ODO: The next time you call me, it'd better be to report a crime. <br>
GARAK: Now that you mention it, I've just witnessed a crime. Letting
Aroya walk out of here without arranging a date. You should be locked
away for that. <br>
ODO: You humanoids. You're all obsessed with these convoluted mating
rituals. <br>
GARAK: True. But do you think we'd waste so much time on something that
wasn't worthwhile? I'll never understand you. You're such a sensitive
man, yet there are so many aspects of humanoid life that you simply
refuse to explore. <br>
ODO: I have no desire to become a slave to humanoid obsessions. <br>
GARAK: But you have to admit, she is quite lovely. <br>
ODO: Well, she is, isn't she? <br>
(Odo has a dizzy spell.) <br>
GARAK: Odo, what's wrong? <br>
ODO: I don't know. <br>
(Odo fits and goes semi-goo before collapsing completely.) <br>
GARAK: Garak to Doctor Bashir. I need a medical emergency team sent to
my shop immediately.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: Doctor, this is a waste of time. You don't
know enough about changeling physiology to diagnose what's wrong with
me. No one does. <br>
BASHIR: Actually, I do have some idea what's going on. I've compared
your current medical scans with ones I've made over the last four years
and there are noticeable differences. Normally when you're in humanoid
form, you have a specific density of one point four which is constant
throughout your body. Your mass and density only vary when you change
shape. Right now, your mass and density are in a state of fluctuation. <br>
ODO: Do you know what's causing it? <br>
BASHIR: No. <br>
ODO: Well, do you know how to prevent it from happening again? <br>
BASHIR: Not yet. <br>
ODO: Then tell me when you do. <br>
BASHIR: I'm afraid I can't let you leave just yet. Moving seems to
increase the fluctuations and may bring on another attack. <br>
ODO: Are you saying that I have to stay here until you discover a cure?
<br>
BASHIR: Or until the fluctuations stop on their own. For all I know,
this could be a normal biological process. The changeling equivalent of
puberty, or menopause. <br>
ODO: That's an interesting theory, Doctor. One I suggest that you keep
to yourself. <br>
BASHIR: Don't worry. This could just as easily turn out to be a virus
or a bacterial infection. Now, lie back and I promise I'll do
everything I can to get you out of here as soon as possible. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GOWRON [on monitor]: We find the Federation's
demands that we return the captured Cardassian colonies insulting and
provocative. Klingon blood was spilled to conquer those worlds. They
are now part of the Klingon Empire and we will never give them up.
Furthermore, if the Federation still harbours any hope of peaceful
coexistence with the Klingon Empire, it must abandon all Starbases and
military installations in the Archanis Sector. Our claim to Archanis
Four and the surrounding territory is ancient and indisputable. We
advise the Federation to leave Archanis, or prepare to face the
consequences. Long live the Empire. <br>
(end of speech) <br>
SISKO: This recording was sent to the Federation Council three days
ago. <br>
WORF: If Gowron is willing to go to war over the Archanis sector, then
he has become even more dangerous than I thought. <br>
KIRA: I don't get it. The Klingons relinquished their claim to Archanis
Four a hundred years ago. <br>
DAX: I guess they've changed their mind. <br>
SISKO: I don't think Gowron gives a damn about Archanis. He's just
looking for an excuse to rattle his sabre. The question is why? <br>
DAX: Yesterday I talked to an old friend of Curzon's from the
Diplomatic Corps. She says that representatives from Federation worlds
near the Klingon border are already urging a preemptive strike. <br>
KIRA: Sounds like war may be inevitable. <br>
SISKO: I hope you're wrong, Major. But right now there's not much we
can do about it either way. Archanis Four is a long way from here. <br>
(Kira sneezes repeatedly.) <br>
DAX: Two, three. I say she stops at seven. <br>
SISKO: I say eight. Mister Worf? <br>
WORF: Ten. <br>
(Kira stops at eight.) <br>
KIRA: I hate being pregnant. <br>
SISKO: I win. <br>
KIRA: My nose hasn't stopped itching for weeks. <br>
DAX: We've noticed. <br>
SISKO: Is there anything Doctor Bashir can do about it? <br>
KIRA: I'm Bajoran. Human women get nauseous. We sneeze. Besides, I
think Doctor Bashir's hands are full right now. <br>
SISKO: How is the Constable? <br>
KIRA: No news yet. I was thinking of going to visit him. <br>
WORF: I doubt that he would wish to be seen in such a weakened state. <br>
DAX: What if he wants some company? Someone to take his mind off his
problems? <br>
WORF: That is doubtful. Odo values his privacy. He does not like to
socialise. <br>
DAX: I think it's all an act. <br>
WORF: It is not an act. He told me so himself. <br>
DAX: But you were socialising with him when he said it. <br>
WORF: Captain, was Dax's last host as argumentative as this one? <br>
SISKO: Worse. <br>
DAX: Thank you, Benjamin. I think. <br>
SISKO: Hopefully Odo will get back on his feet soon. In the meantime, I
want him left alone to rest. Agreed? (A-Choo!) Agreed.

ODO: If you're looking for Doctor Bashir, he's not in right now. <br>
KIRA: Actually, I came to see you. <br>
ODO: To be honest, Major, I really don't feel like company right now. <br>
KIRA: I didn't plan on staying. I just came to bring you this. <br>
ODO: Ah. Today's criminal activities report. <br>
KIRA: I figured you might be getting tired of staring at medical
consoles all day. <br>
ODO: That was very thoughtful of you, Major. <br>
KIRA: If there's anything else you need, you let me know. <br>

RIONOJ: Security Chief Odo. I heard you were indisposed. <br>
ODO: You heard wrong. Now you and I need to talk about those missing

BASHIR: How are you feeling? <br>
ODO: See for yourself. <br>
(He's only partially solid) <br>
BASHIR: It's gotten worse. <br>
ODO: Very observant, Doctor. It's been more and more difficult for me
to maintain humanoid form. <br>
BASHIR: The latest test results aren't encouraging. The destabilisation
of your molecular structure is increasing at an alarming rate. <br>
ODO: How much longer before I totally lose my ability to stay solid. <br>
BASHIR: One week, maybe two. After that, if the destabilisation
continues. I sent my findings to Doctor Mora. Frankly, he was as
baffled as I am, but he wants you to come to his laboratory on Bajor
for further tests. <br>
ODO: Seven years of playing lab rat for him was quite enough. Besides,
you have complete access to his data. If the answer was there, you'd
have found it by now. <br>
BASHIR: I don't suppose you'd agree on a trip to Starfleet Medical? <br>
ODO: Doctor, I think we both know where I have to go. <br>
BASHIR: I was hoping it wouldn't come to that. <br>
ODO: There doesn't seem to be much choice. You have to take me back to
my people. The only ones who can help me now are the Founders.

his people in time? <br>

their attention. <br>
SISKO: You can be sure of that. <br>

WORF: Why not use the transporter? <br>

GARAK: Ah, Captain. How good of you to see me. <br>
SISKO: Make it brief, Garak. <br>
GARAK: I'd like to accompany you on your mission. There are some
questions I'd like to ask the Founders. <br>
SISKO: Such as? <br>
GARAK: The Cardassian Empire lost a number of ships during their
aborted attack on the Dominion. I want to know what happened to the
crewmembers. <br>
SISKO: I was under the impression that those ships were destroyed with
all hands. <br>
GARAK: Oh, we don't know that for a fact. As I recall, when the Defiant
left the scene of the battle, there were a number of Cardassian
warships still fighting. <br>
SISKO: Ah. And you think some of their crewmembers might have been
taken prisoner? <br>
GARAK: I live in hope. Besides, if you do take me along, I think you'll
find me quite useful. I'm a man of many talents. <br>
SISKO: I have no need for a tailor on this mission, let alone a spy.
But maybe there is something you can do for me. This is going to be a
long trip for Odo. I need someone to occupy his attention, take his
mind off his condition. <br>
GARAK: You want me to keep him company? <br>
SISKO: No. Anyone can do that. Dax, Bashir, myself. And what would we
have to offer him? Kindness? Sympathy? That's the last thing he wants. <br>
GARAK: But where you offer kindness, I offer mystery. Where you offer
sympathy, I offer intrigue. Just give me a seat next to Odo's bed and I
promise you I will conjure up enough innuendos, half-truths, and
bald-faced lies about my so-called career in the Obsidian Order to keep
the Constable distracted for days. If there's one thing Cardassians
excel at, it's conversation. <br>
SISKO: You've got yourself a job. But all questions for the Founders
will have to wait until after Odo gets the help he needs. <br>

to take him. The faster we get moving, the better off he'll be. <br>

accompanying him on the rest of his journey. However, I'm sure you
understand my reluctance to reveal the location of our new home.

ODO: Are you saying that you knew I was sick even before we left the

FOUNDER: What do you think? <br>

different. You killed a changeling, Odo. <br>
ODO: He was trying to kill my friends. I had no choice. <br>
FOUNDER: Of course you had a choice, and you chose to side with the
solids. To protect them, you were willing to violate the most sacred
law of our people. <br>
ODO: No changeling has ever harmed another. <br>
FOUNDER: Until you. That's why we forced you to return home to enter
into the Great Link and be judged. <br>
ODO: What does that mean, I'm going to be judged? <br>
FOUNDER: You will join us in the Great Link, open your thoughts, allow
us to understand you. Only then will we be able to decide if your
actions were justified. <br>
ODO: And if you decide that they weren't? <br>
FOUNDER: You will be punished. <br>
ODO: Punished? How? <br>
FOUNDER: You have to understand that nothing like this has ever
happened in the entire history of our people. We have never had to sit
in judgement over one of our own. That's why we took so long to bring
you home. There was disagreement in the Link over what to do with you. <br>
ODO: I'm sorry I've caused you so much trouble. <br>
FOUNDER: Perhaps we are to blame. We sent you away. <br>

FOUNDER: That remains to be seen. <br>
ODO: What if I refuse to cooperate? What if I refuse to join the Link? <br>
FOUNDER: I stabilised your condition temporarily. Only the Link can
heal you. If you refuse to join with us, you will die. <br>
(The Founder steps into the corridor.) <br>
FOUNDER: You may go in now, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: Thank you. <br>
FOUNDER: Try not to disturb him. He needs his rest. <br>

your time? <br>
FOUNDER: You are Cardassian. <br>
GARAK: That's right. And on behalf of my people, I'd like to learn if
there were any survivors after our attack on your homeland. <br>
FOUNDER: Cardassian survivors? <br>
GARAK: Yes. <br>
FOUNDER: There were no Cardassian survivors. <br>
GARAK: You mean, they're all dead? <br>
FOUNDER: They're dead. You're dead, Cardassia is dead. Your people were
doomed the moment they attacked us. I believe that answers your
question. <br>
GARAK: It was a pleasure meeting you.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: I don't suppose there's any way Odo could
hide a communicator on him when he's in the Link with the Founders? <br>
WORF: I do not think he'll be able to hide anything from the Founders. <br>
O'BRIEN: There must be some way we can keep a transporter lock on him
while he's in the Link. <br>
SISKO: What about injecting him with radio-nuclides? <br>
O'BRIEN: That would give the transporter something to lock on to, but
there's no way to be sure the nuclides won't disperse throughout the
Link. If he's in there for more than a few hours, we could end up with
a transporter pad full of
shape-shifters. <br>
ODO: I wouldn't worry about that, Chief. <br>
SISKO: Constable, shouldn't you be in bed? <br>
BASHIR: He insisted on coming to see you himself. <br>
ODO: I thought you might be trying to help me and I wanted to say,
don't bother. <br>
O'BRIEN: Odo, surely you don't really expect us to just stand by while
they do God knows what to you? <br>
ODO: That is exactly what I expect. Captain, I want to be judged. I'm
the only changeling who's ever harmed another. I've spent most of my
life bringing people to justice. Now that it's my turn, how can I run
away? <br>
SISKO: Are you sure that's what you'll find in the Great Link? Justice?
<br>
O'BRIEN: I've heard a lot of stories about the Dominion and the
Founders, and justice seems to be the last thing on their minds. <br>
ODO: Nevertheless, they're my people and I intend to accept their
judgement.

you'll have to ask our navigator. <br>
SISKO: How much longer? <br>
AMAT'IGAN: You'll be informed when we reach our destination. <br>
FOUNDER: We will be within transporter range of my world in less than
one hour. After we have achieved orbit, Odo and I will transport to the

GARAK: Don't tell me. I overlooked one of the security monitors. <br>
WORF: You were trying to override the launch controls for the quantum
torpedoes. <br>
GARAK: I was hoping to gain control of the phasers as well. I just
hadn't got around to it yet. Don't you see? We have an opportunity
here. A chance to end the Dominion threat once and for all. We have
enough firepower on this ship to turn that planet into a smoking
cinder. Personally, I think that would be a very good thing. <br>
WORF: And what about Odo, and Captain Sisko and Doctor Bashir? <br>
GARAK: They'll die. And once the Jem'Hadar ships realise what we're
doing, so will we. But what are our lives compared to saving the entire
Alpha Quadrant? <br>
WORF: We are not here to wage war. <br>
GARAK: I'm not talking about war. What I'm proposing is wiping out
every Founder on that planet. Obliterating the Great Link. Come now,
Mister Worf, you're a Klingon. Don't tell me you'd object to a little
genocide in the name of self-defence? <br>
WORF: I am a warrior, not a murderer. <br>
GARAK: What you are is a great disappointment. <br>

BASHIR: Captain, I'm reading a heart, lungs, and a digestive system.
It's as if he were human. <br>
FOUNDER: We gave him what he wanted. We made him a solid. He's one of
you now. Oh, poor Odo. Perhaps we should have killed you. It would have
been far less cruel. He's yours. Take him and go. <br>

GARAK: Itchy? That's the Inkarian wool. You'll get used to it. Unless
of course you're allergic to Inkarian wool. <br>
ODO: It's not the uniform. I think I'm hungry? <br>

get to enjoy for the first time. <br>
ODO: I can hardly wait. Well, you've done your job. Now I have to do

assaulting a Federation officer, attempting to incite war between the

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: Constable, are you all right? <br>
ODO: It's nothing. It's just a headache. Every once in a while I still
get flashes of memory from the Great Link. A jumble of images or a
word, but I can't quite make sense of it. <br>
SISKO: You know, there's no reason to rush things. You don't have to go
back to work right away. <br>
ODO: Yes, I do. When I joined with the other changelings in the Great
Link, I felt something I've never felt before. In that moment, I knew I
was home. For the first time, I felt that I understood my people. Their
distrust of the solids, their willingness to do anything to protect
themselves. And then in an instant it was all snatched away. I'm
trapped in this body. I can never rejoin the Great Link. My job is the
only thing I have left. Besides, I'm still the best law enforcement
officer on this station. <br>
SISKO: You're the best law enforcement officer in this sector. Maybe
the whole damn quadrant. <br>
ODO: Maybe. What's that all about? <br>

GOWRON [on monitor]: The Klingon Empire is tired of words, of
negotiation, of the endless delaying tactics of the Federation.
Therefore, as of today, a Klingon task force has been dispatched to the
Archanis Sector. Starfleet has ten days to abandon their bases and
withdraw their forces from the Sector. <br>
KIRA: It's coming in on all frequencies. <br>
GOWRON [on monitor]: Any Starfleet vessels found in the Sector after
that time will be considered the enemy and fired upon. <br>
SISKO: Major, put the station on combat alert. Notify the Bajoran
militia. <br>
ODO: Captain. It's him. <br>
SISKO: Gowron? What about him? <br>
ODO: During the Link, I sensed that the other changelings were trying
to hide things from me. Faces, names. One of them was him. <br>
KIRA: What are you saying? <br>
ODO: I'm saying that he's one of them. Gowron, the head of the Klingon
Empire, is a changeling. <br>
GOWRON [on monitor]: No misinterpretation of my words. Archanis is ours
and we will take it back. Resist us in any way, and there will be war! </font>
