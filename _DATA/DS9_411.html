JAKE: Oh yeah, what is it? <br>
SISKO: The two of us are going to Bajor for the start of the Gratitude
Festival. <br>
JAKE: What's the Gratitude Festival? <br>
SISKO: It's the biggest Bajoran holiday of the year. Major Kira says
it's pretty spectacular. And I figured, while we were on the surface,
we could visit those fire caverns you've been wanting to see. <br>
JAKE: Sounds great. When do we leave? <br>

SISKO: What kind of plans? <br>
JAKE: There's an Andorian freighter due in for a maintenance check
tomorrow night. <br>
SISKO: An Andorian freighter? <br>
JAKE: It's supposed to be carrying a shipment of those new anti-grav
tractors. We're hoping we'll get a chance to see one. <br>

madam. Here at Quark's customer satisfaction is our primary concern.
Now, you run along back to the dabo table. Rom, that lady tells me she
misplaced a fat currency pouch. <br>
ROM: Yes, brother? <br>
QUARK: And then you found it. <br>
ROM: Yes, brother. <br>
QUARK: And then you returned it to her intact. <br>

QUARK: You worthless, tiny eared fool! Don't you know the First Rule of
Acquisition? <br>
ROM: Yes, brother. <br>
QUARK: Then say it. <br>
ROM: Once you have their money, you never give it back. <br>
QUARK: Exactly. You can ponder its meaning this evening while polishing
every rail in the place. Now get out of my sight before I toss you out
the nearest airlock. <br>

yours? Sloth and indolence? <br>

QUARK: (kisses the staff) Tell me, is the Grand Nagus here on business
or pleasure? <br>
KRAX: Is there a difference? <br>
QUARK: No, of course not. <br>
KRAX: My father will reveal the purpose of his visit when he sees fit.
As for now, he desires the use of a holosuite. He's heard that some of
your programmes are quite alluring. <br>
QUARK: Oh, they are. They are. But they may prove a touch energetic for
his advanced years. <br>
KRAX: Are you refusing his request? <br>
QUARK: Not at all. Not at all. Is there a particular activity he'd like
to sample? <br>
KRAX: The Nagus dislikes having to choose between so many delightful
possibilities. <br>
QUARK: In that case, here's a list of five programmes that rank among
my personal favourites. I'd be happy to select one for him. <br>
KRAX: That won't be necessary. The Nagus has decided to try all five.

O'BRIEN: Sorry I'm late. The Transporter in Ops needed a minor
adjustment in its upper molecular imaging scanner. but never mind that.
All right, let's settle down. Let's settle down! Jake! Nog! Nog! <br>
(Nog finally sits down) <br>
O'BRIEN: Thank you. Now we only have two more weeks to get through
before Mrs O'Brien returns from Earth, so that shouldn't be too
difficult, right? Right. Let's take out our homework PADDs. We'll begin
with the older students. Your last assignment was to write an essay
defining the term 'ethics.' Let's start with Nog. <br>
(Who has been trying to disappear under his desk) <br>
NOG: I don't have my essay. <br>
O'BRIEN: Why not? <br>
NOG: My PADD was stolen. <br>
O'BRIEN: Is that a fact? Any idea who stole it? <br>
NOG: It happened in Quark's. I put it on a table and there were some
Vulcans nearby <br>
O'BRIEN: Hold on. You're saying Vulcans stole your homework?! <br>
NOG: Yes, sir. <br>
O'BRIEN: Any idea why? <br>
NOG: Because they don't have ethics? <br>
(Giggles around the room) <br>
O'BRIEN: All right, that's enough. <br>
NOG: It's the truth. Ask Jake. He was with me. Go on. Tell him. <br>
JAKE: I guess so. <br>
O'BRIEN: You guess? <br>
JAKE: He, yeah. They took it. I was there. <br>
O'BRIEN: All right, but I want that essay in tomorrow. Is that
understood? <br>

QUARK: What if he injured himself? <br>

suggesting we disobey him? <br>
QUARK: Forget I ever said anything. <br>

QUARK: I hope you can live on pride, because that's all we'll have left

than Nog. <br>
SISKO: I'm afraid that's easier said than done. The two of them have
become inseparable. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, I'd find a way to separate them, sir. That Nog's a bad
influence. <br>
SISKO: I appreciate the advice, Chief, but I trust my son. (the
turbolift is working again) Besides, if I get between them now, it
would become me versus Nog, and I'm not going to force Jake to choose
between us. <br>

him to rot behind bars while you kept all the profits. <br>

ZEK: Never allow family to stand in the way of opportunity. I certainly
never have. You see, I told you he had brains. You've done well for
yourself, Quark. <br>
QUARK: Not that well. <br>

room. And no studying. My apologies, Nagus. It's those Federation
do-gooders, always sticking their ugly noses in other peoples business.

Nevertheless, it is becoming more and more difficult to find truly
lucrative business opportunities here in the Alpha Quadrant. And why?
Because no matter where we go, our reputation precedes us. A reputation
tainted by the lies of our competitors, who maliciously spread the
erroneous impression that we are not to be trusted. But now, thanks to
the discovery of the wormhole, for the first time we can now avoid such
falsehoods. The Gamma Quadrant, gentlemen. Millions of new worlds at

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODO: So, what exactly does it mean, becoming Grand
Nagus? <br>
QUARK: It means that from now on if you wish to speak to me, you must
first make an appointment with Rom. <br>
ODO: Don't be ludicrous. <br>
QUARK: It's also customary to show respect by kissing my sceptre. <br>
(Odo leaves) <br>
QUARK: I suppose I could make an exception in your case. <br>
(Quark puts his foot on a dropped coin, then bends down to pick it up,
just as a small missile whooshes in and explodes against the wall.) <br>
(Later, examining the crime scene) <br>
O'BRIEN: You see the discoloration around the impact perimeter? These
are sorium and argine traces. <br>
SISKO: Aren't they Ferengi explosives? <br>
O'BRIEN: Exactly. What we have here is a Ferengi locator bomb, designed
to lock on to a target's pheromones. <br>
ODO: You mean they're attracted to body odour? <br>
O'BRIEN: Very deadly and very accurate. If Quark hadn't lowered his
head at the last second <br>
BASHIR: Commander. <br>
SISKO: Yes, Doctor? <br>
BASHIR: I've just given Quark a thorough examination. He's a bit shaken
up, nothing more. <br>

twisted little brain that we are trying to save your life. <br>
QUARK: You're trying to interfere in Ferengi affairs of state, which
are none of your concern. <br>
SISKO: Now look here, Quark. <br>
ROM: Grand Nagus Quark. <br>
SISKO: Those locator bombs are damn near foolproof. You were lucky
once. Next time we could be scraping you off the walls. <br>
QUARK: The Grand Nagus does not ask for help from outsiders. <br>
ODO: I'm sure whoever tried to kill you is counting on that. You must
have some suspicion who that could be? <br>
QUARK: I'm suspicious of everybody. <br>
ODO: But who would you say stands to benefit the most from your death? <br>
QUARK: Let's see. That would have to be Krax. Yes, if anything happens
to me, Krax becomes Nagus. <br>
ROM: True, but let's not forget that it was Gral who threatened you. <br>
ODO: Threatened you? How? <br>
QUARK: That's none of your concern. Besides, Gral and Krax were at the
funeral when the bomb went off. Which means that neither one of them
could have set it. <br>
SISKO: Whoever planned this could have had an accomplice. <br>
ODO: You're sure all of Zek's associates attended the funeral? <br>
QUARK: Yes, yes, they were all there. Look, this is getting us nowhere.
<br>
ODO: What about Zek's servant? <br>
ROM: You mean Maihar'du? <br>
QUARK: What about him? <br>
ODO: Was he at the funeral? <br>
ROM: I don't recall seeing him there. Do you? <br>
QUARK: Now that you mention it, no, I don't. <br>
(Quark and Rom leave) <br>
ODO: Interesting. Hupyrian servants are renowned for their devotion to
their employers. For Maihar'du not to have shown up at Zek's funeral is
very odd indeed.

NAVA: Yes, Nagus. <br>

NAVA: I'd like the chance to introduce synthehol to the Gamma Quadrant.
<br>
QUARK: A very lucrative opportunity. Tell me Nava, when Zek announced I
was to succeed him, were you pleased? <br>
(We see Quark is sitting in a chair, stroking a gilvos, and doing his
Blomfeld impression) <br>
NAVA: No, Nagus. <br>
QUARK: Did you come to me and offer your support? <br>
NAVA: No, Nagus. <br>
QUARK: Yet, now you call me Nagus. But is it out of true friendship?
No. You only pretend to show me respect so I will grant you this
immense opportunity. <br>

KRAX: If he keeps handing out these choice opportunities, he's going to
become very popular. <br>

reliable than a locator bomb. Something that can't possibly fail to
kill my dear brother.
