50074.3. We have detected evidence that a wormhole recently appeared
and then disappeared in a nearby solar system. We're on our way there
to investigate.

Kim's station.) <br>
KIM: Based on the residual neutrino levels, I'd estimate it's been at
least six months since the wormhole's last appearance. <br>
CHAKOTAY: From the dispersal pattern of the interstellar plasma, it
looks like it isn't fixed. Seems to be travelling through space. <br>
JANEWAY: It may not be fixed on this end, nut if it's shown up in the
same location more than once, it's possible its exit point is constant,
and it's wagging around the Delta Quadrant like the tail on a dog. <br>
PARIS: Approaching the last known co-ordinates of the wormhole,
Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: All stop. Mister Kim, initiate continuous neutrino scans. <br>
KIM: Aye, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok, scan the planets in this system for life signs.
Maybe there's someone around here who can give us some helpful
information. <br>
TUVOK: I am picking up an M-class atmosphere on the second planet,
humanoid life signs. However, metallurgic analysis indicates a
pre-industrial civilisation, a Bronze Age level of technology. Curious,
Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: What is? <br>
TUVOK: I'm detecting evidence that these people have had contact with
the Alpha Quadrant. <br>
JANEWAY: What kind of evidence? <br>
TUVOK: It is a modulated energy discharge that appears to be consistent
with the recent use of a replicator. <br>
KIM: If they've got a replicator, it could mean the wormhole leads to
the Alpha Quadrant, and that someone's travelled through it. <br>
JANEWAY: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Ensign, but before we indulge in
too much speculation, let's see if we can back up your assumptions with
some facts. Commander Chakotay, I want you and Lieutenant Paris to go
down that planet and have a look around. Launch a high resolution
reconnaissance probe to gather information about the local population's
dress and appearance. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: In the meantime, Ensign, why don't you and Lieutenant Torres
get started on a phase profile of this elusive wormhole's neutrino
emissions. Let's see if we can confirm that it leads to the Alpha
Quadrant.

Chakotay uses his tricorder near a fruit stall then walks back to
Paris.) <br>
PARIS: This is where we picked up a replicator signature? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Hard to believe, isn't it? <br>
(An older man in a long robe, and wearing a patch over his right eye,
enters the square declaiming a poem.) <br>
BARD: Oh, those many years ago, the people's hearts were sad and low.
Then the Sages to the city came. They came upon a burning flame just as
the Seers said they would. They lifted Takar's blinding
hood. Well? What did you think? <br>
CHAKOTAY: It was very nice. <br>
BARD: Nice? I'll wager you've never heard the Song of the Sages more
beautifully or faithfully recited. <br>
PARIS: He's got a point. We have never heard the Song of the Sages more
beautifully recited. <br>
BARD: As you know, the first verse is free, but the next verse will
cost you three frangs. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm sorry. Not today. <br>
BARD: Oh, but I need money for ointment for my eye. Please, gentlemen! <br>
MERCHANT: Go away, old man! Can't you see? These are men of commerce.
They have no business with your silly poems. And may I say, gentlemen,
you both have very fine shoes. <br>
PARIS: Excuse me? <br>
MERCHANT: Well, the Sages say you can tell a great deal about a man
from his shoes, and I can tell from your shoes that you're men of
refinement, affluence. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We've really got to be going. <br>
MERCHANT: Well, you're obviously new in Takar. Perhaps I could interest
you in some property. <br>
PARIS: No, thank you. We're not planning on settling here. <br>
MERCHANT: What about some transportation? The Sages say, 'Time's an
asset.' And you shouldn't waste your assets walking everywhere you go.
You'd be wearing out those fine shoes of yours. <br>
PARIS: I'm sorry, but we're really not interested. <br>
(Chakotay is using his tricorder behind their backs.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tom? <br>
PARIS: Excuse me. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm picking up a narrow band EM dampening field around that
building. It looks like some sort of temple. <br>
PARIS: Then I'd say the temple's where we ought to look. <br>
MERCHANT: Oh, thank the Sages I found you. You can't enter the temple
without wearing your ears. <br>
PARIS: Look, friend, I thought I told you <br>
CHAKOTAY: What do you mean, wearing your ears? <br>
MERCHANT: You're really not Takarian, are you? Nobody visits the temple
without displaying at least one ear. <br>
(They see passersby with replicas of large-lobed ears on thongs around
their necks.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Must be some sort of fetish. <br>
MERCHANT: If you're not wearing an ear, you could be fined, even
arrested. You wouldn't want that to happen. <br>
PARIS: And let me guess. It just so happens that you could sell us a
couple of these ears. <br>
MERCHANT: As a matter of fact, I can. <br>

footwear.)

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Captain's

Kim in the science lab to hear what they've termed as very exciting
news.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Science
lab]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM:
We've been able to confirm that the wormhole does lead to the Alpha
Quadrant. <br>
TORRES: The problem is that on this end, it's jumping from point to
point so quickly that even at maximum warp, by the time we got to its
next probable location, it would be gone. <br>
KIM: So we were thinking, if you can't bring the ship to the wormhole,
bring the wormhole to the ship. We've detected a subspace instability
at our current location that's a result of the wormhole's last
appearance here. <br>
TORRES: If we could somehow amplify and polarise that instability, we
might be able to get the wormhole to reappear. <br>
JANEWAY: Sort of like using a magnet to move a compass needle. The
question is, how do we polarise the instability? <br>
KIM: We haven't figured that part out yet.

PARIS: And my feet are now cold. <br>
MERCHANT: Perhaps I could interest you in some discounted mining
futures? <br>
PARIS: Don't push your luck. <br>
(They walk away.) <br>
PARIS: You know, so far, I can't say that I like this town very much. <br>
(A large gong is struck four times, then the temple door opens and
young women in spangly bikinis and thin veils walk out and stand behind
two thrones.) <br>
PARIS: On the other hand. <br>
(The gong-striker drags out a box covered in a cloth.) <br>
KAFAR: My friends, the Holy Sages. <br>
(Enter two gaudily clad - Ferengi!) <br>
KAFAR: Behold, the Holy Icon. <br>

ARRIDOR: Greed is eternal. <br>
CROWD: Greed is eternal. <br>
ARRIDOR: Greed is eternal. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Greed is eternal. <br>
ARRIDOR: Now what other wisdom have you learned from the Sages? A wise
man can hear profit in the wind. <br>
CROWD: A wise man can hear profit in the wind. <br>
(Chakotay and Paris move out of sight.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Voyager. <br>

you to come forward to honour our greatness and glorify our generosity.
Approach the Holy Sages. Approach your gods and speak your heart. Ah. <br>
(The supplicant goes onto his knees and crawls towards the thrones.
Kafar puts a leather box in front of him and opens it.) <br>
SANDAL MAKER: I am a sandal maker from the poorest quarter of the city.
<br>
KOL: The laziest, you mean. <br>
ARRIDOR: Speak, my friend. What is your business with the Sages? <br>
SANDAL MAKER: I am in need of assistance. My sandal shop is failing. I
can no longer feed my family. <br>
KOL: Same old song. <br>
SANDAL MAKER: My wife and her mother, my five children, the baby. <br>
ARRIDOR: That's seven employees. Eight, if you count the infant. How
can your shop be failing? <br>
KOL: You're not paying them, are you? <br>
SANDAL MAKER: My mother-in-law is ill. My children are very young. <br>
KOL: Oh, don't tell me none of them are working. Ignorant, lobeless
fools! <br>
ARRIDOR: Exploitation begins at home! <br>
CROWD: Exploitation begins at home. <br>
ARRIDOR: Exploitation begins at home! <br>
SANDAL MAKER: Exploitation begins at home. I understand my mistake and
I promise to begin exploiting my family before the end of the day. But
could I have some food and, and some medicine? <br>
KOL: Ha! Ha! <br>
SANDAL MAKER: Until my business improves. <br>
ARRIDOR: You shall have something far more valuable. One copy of the
Rules of Acquisition, cheapest binding possible. <br>

Arridor goes back inside.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Captain's
log, supplemental. The away team has returned with some very disturbing
observations about the situation on the planet.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Briefing
room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CHAKOTAY:
It seems the people have a myth, an epic poem called the Song of the
Sages, which predicts the arrival of two demigods from the sky, the
Sages, who would rule over the people as benevolent protectors. <br>
PARIS: But these Ferengi are anything but benevolent. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What they've done is co-opt the local mythology by using
advanced technology like the replicator to convince the people that
they're the two Sages spoken of in the poem. <br>
PARIS: Of course, being Ferengi, they haven't just co-opted the
mythology. They've cornered the market on everything. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's disgusting, Captain. The two Ferengi live in a palatial
temple, while the people are lucky to have a roof over their heads. <br>
PARIS: Apparently it wasn't always like that. According to the people
that we met, before the Ferengi came, the society may have been
primitive, but it was flourishing. What I'd like to know is how two
Ferengi got to the Delta Quadrant. <br>
JANEWAY: We've been looking into that. Mister Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: According to Starfleet computer records, approximately seven
years ago, the Federation Starship Enterprise hosted negotiations for
ownership of the <a href="../NextGen/156.htm" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" target="_blank"> Barzan
wormhole</a>. Included among the bidding parties were two
Ferengi, minor functionaries known as Arridor and
Kol. <br>
NEELIX: And this Barzan wormhole, it's the same one we've discovered
now? <br>
KIM: Apparently, but we've confirmed what nobody knew at the time. The
wormhole is fixed in the Alpha Quadrant. But in the Delta Quadrant, it
jumps around. It turned out to be worthless. <br>
TUVOK: But the Ferengi were not aware of that, and during a nefarious
attempt to secure the wormhole for themselves, they were pulled into it
and deposited in the Delta Quadrant. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Now that we've found them, what are we going to do with them?
<br>
JANEWAY: Well, I certainly don't intend to leave them here to continue
exploiting an innocent society. How are you two coming with getting the
wormhole back here and reopened? <br>
TORRES: We've been bombarding the area of the subspace instability with
verteron particles. <br>
KIM: So far everything is going according to plan, but it's tricky.
There are a hundred factors that could deflect it from this sector. A
gravimetric shift, a solar flare. <br>
TORRES: And even if we're lucky enough to get it here, it won't be
around for long. We'll have a very short window of opportunity to get
through. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, if we can get the wormhole here, we'll be taking two
additional passengers with us. We'll turn them over to Ferengi
authorities when we get there. <br>
TUVOK: Captain, I must remind you that the Ferengi are not members of
the Federation. They are not bound by the Prime Directive. Nor would it
seem that the Prime Directive would allow us to interfere with the
internal affairs of this society, as much as we may disapprove of what
the Ferengi are doing. <br>
JANEWAY: The Federation did host the negotiations. And if it weren't
for those negotiations, the Ferengi wouldn't be here. So one could say,
without being unreasonable I think, that the Federation is partially
responsible for what's happened, and therefore duty bound to correct
the situation. <br>
TUVOK: That is a most logical interpretation, Captain.

those rules forbid you to interfere with indigenous cultures. <br>

to be their Sages. <br>

JANEWAY: Don't be ridiculous. <br>
ARRIDOR: The song is sung of Sages who can perform miracles which,
thanks to our replicator, we do. The song is sung of men coming from
the sky on a burning flame. When we crash-landed our shuttle in their
quaint little town square, trailing behind us a roaring ribbon of
burning plasma. <br>
KOL: You mean we really are the Sages? <br>
ARRIDOR: The point is, Captain, that these people have believed for
centuries that gods, known as the Sages, would deliver them from their
strife. To them, we are those Sages. What happens to a people when they
lose their gods? Despair, fear, confusion. And how can you as a moral
people blithely tear down the spiritual structure that has supported a
community since before their gods were flesh? What would you be leaving
them with? <br>

temporarily and were kind enough to send a probe through, informing us
of your impressive operation. <br>
ARRIDOR: Well, of course, the Grand Nagus, or his official messenger
the Grand Proxy, is always welcome in our little world, our rather
poverty-stricken little world, and we're thrilled he has taken an
interest in our very modest operation. <br>

ARRIDOR: (to Kol) This is not a time to lose one's lobes. I'll think of
something. (to Neelix) Perhaps the Grand Nagus doesn't understand that
profits in this market depend upon our presence. You see, to these
people we're, well, gods actually. Without us to make the fools cower
in submission, there will be no profits to be had. <br>
NEELIX: The Grand Nagus knows all about your little scheme, the Song of
the Sages and all the rest of it. Very clever. But he wants you and all
your acquisitions back on Ferenginar before the wormhole closes again. <br>
ARRIDOR: I'm sure the Grand Nagus wouldn't want to lose such a
lucrative revenue stream. The wormhole seems to open and close on its
own every seven or eight years. We would be willing to forward a fair
share of the profits every time it does, say, twenty percent? <br>
KOL: That's coming out of your half. <br>
ARRIDOR: Shut up! <br>
NEELIX: The Grand Nagus has no intention of losing profits from this
market. That's why he's already got a team of scientists investigating
the human's technology to see if we can find a way to open and close
the wormhole whenever we want. <br>
ARRIDOR: Then perhaps the Grand Nagus could simply recall one of us and
leave the other behind to administer the operation. You could take Kol
back with you. <br>
KOL: Hey, wait a minute. <br>
NEELIX: That's enough! <br>
KOL: I don't think that <br>
NEELIX: The Grand Nagus has recalled you both. It's non-negotiable. Of
course, the Nagus doesn't want to upset the local population. He may
want to send others in your place. That's why he wants you to make a
little speech telling the people that their Holy
Sages have been recalled to the Divine Treasury or whatever it is the
people around here call it. Then he wants you to tell them not to
worry, that everything will be all right without you. Then he wants you
to thank them for their generosity. <br>

NEELIX: The 299th Rule of Acquisition, Whenever you exploit someone, it
never hurts to thank them. That way it's easier to exploit them the
next time. <br>

(The Bard's eye patch has moved from the right to the left eye.) <br>

NEELIX: I'm, er, well. <br>
BARD: You are another Holy One, aren't you? <br>
NEELIX: That's right. Another Holy One. <br>
BARD: Then you'll appreciate this. The Sages in the sky did dwell upon
white clouds that held them well. Until the sentry rang the bell, the
Holy Sages never fell. That'll be three frangs, please. <br>
PARIS: But we didn't ask you to recite it. <br>
BARD: Well, you heard it, didn't you? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Your poem's very nice, but we're in a hurry. <br>
BARD: No, please, sir! My eye <br>

minute. Wasn't your patch on the other side? <br>
(The Bard moves his patch from left to right, then holds his hand out.)
<br>
BARD: Sir? <br>
PARIS: We've got to go. <br>
BARD: Wait, please. I'll throw in another verse gratis. But when the
ringing called them here, from the sky they did appear. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tell me something. What happens to the Sages at the end of
the Song? <br>
BARD: Oh, let me see now. The final verse. It's been a very long time,
you know. Those are very handsome shoes you have, sir. <br>
(Chakotay takes his shoes off.) <br>
BARD: Ah, yes, it's coming back to me now. And there, amid the eastern
lights, three new stars appeared that night. And with the ringing of
the bell, the Sages knew where they must dwell. The Holy Pilgrim led
them back, high into the sky of black, and riding on the wings of fire,
the Holy Men rose higher and higher. Wait a minute. I know who you are.
<br>
(That evening, Neelix walks up the temple steps.) <br>

Song of the Sages. <br>
ARRIDOR: What in the name of eternal destitution is going on here? <br>
NEELIX: Ah, there you are. Do you not recognise me? I am the Holy
Pilgrim. <br>
KOL: The Holy Pilgrim? Who's the Holy Pilgrim? <br>
ARRIDOR: Quiet, you idiot. This man is no Holy Pilgrim. He's a
Talaxian! <br>
CROWD: Talaxian? <br>
NEELIX: Oh no, Great Sage, you are mistaken. I am indeed the Holy
Pilgrim. And just as the Song of the Sages promises, I have come to
lead you back, high into the sky of black. <br>
SANDAL MAKER: I have prayed for this day to come. <br>
PARIS: Lead them back! Lead them back! <br>
CROWD: Lead them back! Lead them back! Lead them back! Lead them back!
Lead them back! Lead them back! <br>
KOL: What do they mean, lead us back? <br>
ARRIDOR: I don't know. It must be part of the song. I told you we
should have listened to the whole thing. <br>
NEELIX: Well, it looks as though you two will be heading off to see the
Grand Nagus after all. <br>
ARRIDOR: We'll see about that. This man, this man is a false Pilgrim.
He's come to steal your profits. <br>
NEELIX: I am not a false Pilgrim and I'll prove it. <br>
