RIKER [OC]: Geordi, have you found it yet? <br>
LAFORGE: Not yet. I'm starting to get some fumes. Ammonia, chlorine,
potassium chloride. <br>
(Geordi climbs up into the fumes to the next level) <br>
LAFORGE: I can feel the heat from here. <br>
(he crawls along an access tunnel) <br>
LAFORGE: There it is. <br>
RIKER [OC]: How far? <br>
LAFORGE: About ten metres up the ODN line. Boy, it's hot. I'd say over
two thousand degrees. I'm going in. <br>

Best of Both Worlds, wearing a virtual reality suit) <br>
CRUSHER: All his vital functions are completely normal. <br>
DATA: The interface unit is operating within expected parameters. <br>
RIKER: Why did he start coughing when he went through the gasses? <br>
CRUSHER: Psychosomatic response. <br>
LAFORGE: (no visor, white eyes) I feel like I'm actually here. I mean
there, in the Jefferies tube. It's funny. When I saw the smoke, I
couldn't help but cough. <br>
DATA: No one else has reported so complete a sensory experience. <br>
CRUSHER: The interface is perfect for Geordi because his visor inputs
allow the probe to transmit information directly into his cerebral
cortex. <br>
RIKER: It looks like this is going to work. Geordi, I'd like to get the
probe out of the Jefferies tube and onto the launch bay before we reach
Marijne Seven. <br>

CRUSHER: The probe is designed to respond to any movement Geordi
intends to make. When his brain sends a message to move his leg, the
interface should move the probe instead. <br>

input. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 47215.5. We are responding
to a distress call from the science vessel Raman, which is apparently
trapped inside the turbulent atmosphere of an unusual gas giant planet.
We will use an experimental interface probe in our attempt to rescue
it.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: I have reviewed the vessel's mission plans.
The Raman was to descend to the lower atmosphere, eleven thousand
kilometres below its current position. The crew was to sample the
atmosphere at that level, and then return to a safer orbit. <br>
LAFORGE: Something must have happened down there. Maybe the shields
failed, or they had some kind of inversion reaction in the nacelles. <br>
PICARD: Any life signs? <br>
LAFORGE: Our biosensors are useless. There's too much interference in
the atmosphere. <br>
RIKER: The crew might still be alive. There's no way we can tell from
up here. <br>
PICARD: Will the probe be able to transmit through that interference? <br>
DATA: The probe sends information via a focused particle beam. It
should be able to cut through the interference. <br>
LAFORGE: But we may have to operate the probe at close to tolerance
levels. <br>
PICARD: Will your nervous system be able to handle that much sensory
input? <br>
LAFORGE: We've already tested the interface at about seventy percent
tolerance. <br>
RIKER: We shouldn't have any trouble going higher. The safety override
will kick in at about ninety eight percent tolerance, and that'll
disengage the interface. <br>
WORF: Captain, I am receiving a transmission from Starfleet Command.
Admiral Holt. <br>
PICARD: In my ready room. The seven people on that ship are our first
priority. Is the probe ready for launch?
<br>DATA: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: Send it directly to the aft section of the Raman through the
secondary air lock. That way it should put it just one bulkhead away
from the Bridge. <br>
LAFORGE: I'll interface with the probe as soon as it's ready, take it
the rest of the way from there. <br>
PICARD: Make it so.

HOLT [on monitor]: Jean-Luc. <br>
PICARD: How's life on DS Three? <br>
HOLT [on monitor]: We're hosting this year's palio. The Ferengi have
already been accused of trying to bribe the Breen pilot into throwing
the race. <br>
PICARD: There's nothing unusual about that. <br>
HOLT [on monitor]: Nothing at all. I wish I could say I was just
calling to catch up on things. Nine days ago, the Hera left here on a
routine courier mission. We were in contact with them for five of those
days. Then the ship disappeared without a trace. <br>
PICARD: The Hera? <br>
HOLT [on monitor]: I'm afraid so. The Excelsior and the Noble have been
retracing its course for the last seventy two hours. Nothing. I'm going
to keep them at it for another seventy two. But to be honest, I don't
think another week would make any difference. <br>

SILVA [on monitor]: I saw your father last week and your sister about
ten days before that. I decided I missed my favourite son. <br>
LAFORGE: Your only son, Ma. <br>
SILVA [on monitor]: You're going to have to see the Hera again. We've
got a lot of new faces on board, including a Chief Engineer who juices
up the nacelles every chance she gets. I think she's the best
technician in the fleet. Okay, second best. <br>
(doorbell) <br>
LAFORGE: Come in. <br>
RIKER: I'm sorry, I didn't know you were <br>
LAFORGE: Don't worry about it. <br>
SILVA [on monitor]: Maybe you should meet her. We're going to be in the
same sector next week. Take a shuttle over and I'll introduce you. <br>
LAFORGE: My mother's always trying to find me a wife. <br>
SILVA [on monitor]: But if you're too busy, I'll see you at your
father's birthday party. Remember, if you talk to him it's a surprise. <br>
(message ends) <br>
LAFORGE: This came in about three weeks ago. I never got back to her. <br>
RIKER: Geordi, the probe has entered the planet's atmosphere and I'm
ready to take it onto the ship. If you would like to take a couple of
days off, I'll run the interface. <br>
LAFORGE: The interface is calibrated specifically to my visor's inputs.
It would take you at least ten hours to convert it, and those crewmen
down there can't wait. <br>
RIKER: The interface doesn't have to be fully compatible. I could run
it right now. I wouldn't have the same control that you have, but it
would still work. <br>
LAFORGE: Forget it. I'm the best person for the job, and there's no
reason why we shouldn't proceed as planned. <br>
RIKER: The Hera is reason enough. <br>
LAFORGE: The Hera is missing, that's all. Now until I hear something
different, my mother might just as well have taken the crew on an
unscheduled holiday. Let's go.

corridor. Methane and ammonia, primarily. That break in the hull might
even be on the Bridge itself.
I'm heading towards the Bridge. I've found someone. <br>
DATA [OC]: What is your position? <br>
LAFORGE: About twelve metres up the main corridor. He's trapped under
some conduit from the bulkhead. I can't move it. I'm going to need more
power to the tractor beam. <br>

it lead to? <br>

PICARD: How did this happen? <br>
CRUSHER: There was some kind of energy discharge in the interface suit.
<br>
PICARD: But shouldn't the safety overrides have prevented that? <br>
CRUSHER: Yes, but I have a theory why they didn't. The tolerance levels
of the interface were set extremely high. I think Geordi's neural
response to the input was so strong that it created a feedback loop. <br>
LAFORGE: The sensors that were transmitting the sensation of heat to my
hands must've overloaded. <br>
PICARD: The crew of the Raman are dead. I would like to retrieve them
and their vessel, but not if it means putting Geordi's safety at risk. <br>
LAFORGE: If we turn down the sensory input on the probe, I should be
fine. Seven people lost their lives down there, Captain. We should at
least retrieve the information they were collecting. <br>
PICARD: Doctor? <br>
CRUSHER: If we operate the interface at lower input levels, I'd say the
risk is acceptable. <br>

waiting for Commander Riker to finish moving the probe. Do you need to
be comforted? <br>

to. <br>
DATA: I am using the time to catch up on my study of poetry. <br>
LAFORGE: Data, there's nothing on the screen. <br>
DATA: That is not entirely correct. While it is true the display is
currently blank, this emptiness has a poetic meaning. Therefore it
cannot be considered nothing as such. <br>
LAFORGE: Says who? <br>
DATA: The ancient Doosodarians. Much of their poetry contained such
lacunae or empty spaces. Often these pauses measured several days in
length, during which poet and audience were encouraged to fully
acknowledge the emptiness of the experience. <br>
LAFORGE: I remember a few lectures from Starfleet Academy that seemed
like that. <br>
DATA: Are you certain you do not wish to talk about your mother? <br>
LAFORGE: Why would you ask that? <br>
DATA: You are no doubt feeling emotional distress as a result of her
disappearance. While you claim to be just passing by, that is most
likely an excuse to start a conversation about this uncomfortable
subject. Am I correct? <br>
LAFORGE: No, Data. Sometimes just passing by means, just passing by. <br>
DATA: Then I apologise for my premature assumption. This particular
poem has a lacuna of forty seven minutes. You may experience the
emptiness with me if you wish. <br>

little too easily. <br>
DATA: I do not understand. <br>

really didn't mean it. <br>
DATA: My initial assumption was correct. You do wish to speak of your
mother. <br>
LAFORGE: Am I crazy to think that she's still alive? <br>
DATA: Your sanity is not in question. However, your evaluation of the
available information is biased. <br>

impossible situations before. Why should this be any different? <br>

she were standing there in the room? <br>
CRUSHER: I'm not sure, I do know that our brains weren't designed to

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TROI: What's your mother like, Geordi? <br>
LAFORGE: If you think I'm going to start talking about my childhood,
Counsellor, you're way off. <br>
TROI: That's not what I asked. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, she's, she's brilliant. Funny. She's incredibly
perceptive. She knows people. Knows what they're all about even before
they open their mouths. She's always been that way. She's a real good
judge of character. <br>
TROI: When was the last time you saw her? <br>
LAFORGE: About seven months ago, when she first took command of the
Hera. I went to a party she had for her crew. She wanted me to come
over and see her, but I was really busy at the time. I mean I suppose I
could have made the time to go and see her, but, you know, I just
didn't think that. I mean, you know, I, I didn't think that <br>
TROI: You didn't think it would be your last chance to see her. <br>
LAFORGE: That's not what I was going to say. <br>
TROI: I want to suggest something. Call it a theory, all right? <br>
LAFORGE: All right. <br>
TROI: You're worried about the disappearance of your mother, guilty
that you didn't see her when you had the chance, so you're unwilling to
consider that she might be dead. Your need to believe she's alive is so
strong that it manifests itself as a physical image. <br>
LAFORGE: But she told me she's trapped on that planet, that she's in
danger. Now, if this was some kind of wish fulfillment, don't you think
I'd be fantasising her safe and sound? <br>
TROI: No. Because that would be the end of your fantasy. You'd know it
wasn't true. The more involved and complicated and unending your story
is, the longer you can believe your mother's still alive. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, well, that's your theory, Counsellor. I've got one of my
own.
