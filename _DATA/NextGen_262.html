<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JULIANA: Captain, our situation has worsened since
my husband and I first contacted you. The molten core of our planet is
not just cooling, it's begun to solidify. <br>
PRAN: Our gravitational field has been affected. Seismic activity has
increased by a factor of three. <br>
JULIANA: If the cooling continues at this rate Atrea will become
uninhabitable in thirteen months. <br>
LAFORGE: We could minimise seismic activity by creating isobaric
fissures and relieving some of the tectonic stress, but that would just
be a temporary fix. <br>
DATA: The only permanent solution would be to re-liquefy the core. <br>
LAFORGE: These pockets in the magma layer, how close are they to the
molten region of the core? <br>
JULIANA: A few kilometres, why? <br>
LAFORGE: Data, do you think that's close enough for ferro-plasmic
infusion? <br>
DATA: The procedure will involve using the ship's phasers to drill down
through the planet's surface into the pockets, where we would set up a
series of plasma infusion units. <br>
LAFORGE: We'll trigger the units by firing modulated energy bursts down
through the shafts. <br>
JULIANA: I see. Injecting sufficient plasma directly into the core
should trigger a chain reaction, and that will reliquify the magma. <br>
DATA: It should be possible to stabilise the core temperature at ninety
three percent of normal. <br>
PRAN: If it works, the core would remain molten for centuries. <br>
PICARD: If you give your permission, we could begin immediately. <br>
PRAN: Very well. But before we proceed, I'd like to update our
geological surveys. <br>
LAFORGE: Fine. I'd be very happy to help you with that, Doctor. <br>
PICARD: I've assigned you quarters during out time here. Please, make
yourselves comfortable. <br>
PRAN: Thank you, Captain. <br>
(Pran, Picard and La Forge leave)&nbsp;<br>
JULIANA: Data? <br>
DATA: Yes, Doctor? <br>
JULIANA: Do you have any idea who I am? <br>
DATA: You are Doctor Juliana Tainer. <br>
JULIANA: You lost all your early memories. We thought you would, but we
couldn't be certain. <br>
DATA: Have we met before? <br>
JULIANA: Oh, Data, I was there, right at the beginning on Omicron
Theta. I helped create you. Now look at you. <br>
DATA: You were a colleague of Doctor Soong? <br>
JULIANA: Yes, I certainly was. And I was also his wife. In a way, I
suppose you could say I am your mother.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ten Forward]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JULIANA: I still can't believe I'm seeing you like
this again, after all these years. <br>
DATA: Doctor, I have no memory of you. <br>
JULIANA: Oh, there's a reason for that. We wiped your processors after
we finished refining your programming. Why don't you tell me what you
do remember, and then I'll fill in the gaps. <br>
DATA: My memory record begins when I was activated by the Starfleet
officers on the Omicron Theta outpost. <br>
JULIANA: After the attack of the Crystalline Entity. <br>
DATA: Yes. All of the inhabitants of the colony were killed. However, I
discovered that my memory banks contained the contents of their
journals and logs. <br>
JULIANA: We hoped their experiences would be useful. After your
childhood, we figured you could use all the help you could get. <br>
DATA: My childhood? <br>
JULIANA: That's what I called it. You were like a baby, at first. A
hundred kilogram baby, but still. You had trouble learning your motor
skills, learning how to process sensory information. And of course
Noonian was never satisfied. He kept tinkering, trying to make you as
human as possible. <br>
DATA: So you wiped my memory processors after this childhood. <br>
JULIANA: Then we deactivated you and programmed you with the colonists'
logs. We had planned to reactivate you, but we never got the chance.
That's when the Crystalline Entity attacked. We had to leave quickly.
We wanted to take you with us, but there was only room for two in the
escape pod. <br>
DATA: Doctor, I have scanned the journals of the colonists. There is
only one Juliana mentioned in them. Her last name was O'Donnell. <br>
JULIANA: That's me. <br>
DATA: But there was no mention that my father was married to you. <br>
JULIANA: Because of my mother. She thought that Noonian was an
eccentric scientist who was too old for me. We decided to marry
secretly to give her a chance to get used to our being together. We
slipped away to Mavala Four and got married there. A Klingon and a
Corvallan trader were our witnesses. It wasn't exactly the wedding I'd
hoped for. Somehow Noonian had a way of making even the oddest things
seem romantic. <br>
DATA: My father did have an unusual way of looking at things. <br>
JULIANA: How would you know that? <br>
DATA: I encountered him once in the Terlina system. <br>
JULIANA: That's where we went to after we left the outpost. I had no
idea that you'd even met him. <br>
DATA: It was shortly before his death. <br>
JULIANA: He's dead? <br>
DATA: Yes. <br>
JULIANA: I had no idea it would hit me this hard. We didn't exactly
part on the best of terms. <br>
DATA: What do you mean? <br>
JULIANA: I realised he loved his work as much as he loved me. Maybe
more. There we were, stuck on this planet in the middle of the jungle
with no one else to talk to. No life. It just wasn't enough. That's why
I left. That was all a very, very long time ago. The important thing is
that we're here now together. And I do want to get to know you. <br>
DATA: This has been an interesting encounter, and an altogether
unexpected one. I would like to corroborate your story before we
proceed further. Excuse me, Doctor.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: Data, I'm almost finished reconfiguring
the phaser banks. We should be able to start drilling in about an hour.
<br>
DATA: Inform me when you are ready. <br>
LAFORGE: What is it you're doing over there? <br>
DATA: I am attempting to ascertain whether Doctor Tainer's story is
true. <br>
LAFORGE: Don't you believe her? <br>
DATA: I neither believe nor doubt. I am simply attempting to verify her
assertions. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, what have you turned up so far? <br>
DATA: The Registrar's Office on Mavala Four cannot confirm whether
Doctor Soong was married there. Apparently many of the documents were
lost when the government was overthrown. <br>
LAFORGE: What's that you're looking at? <br>
DATA: I am checking passenger manifests to see if they went to Mavala
during the period in question. O'Donnell, Juliana. Soong, Noonian. They
were both passengers on a transport which travelled from Omicron Theta
to Mavala and returned four days later. <br>
LAFORGE: That sure fits with her story. <br>
DATA: Still, the fact that they went to Mavala does not prove they were
married there. <br>
LAFORGE: You know, Data, it almost seems to me like you're trying to
prove that Doctor Tainer wasn't telling the truth. <br>
DATA: Not at all. I am merely unable to reconcile her story with the
fact that my father never mentioned her to me. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, she did leave him. Maybe she broke his heart. Maybe he
just didn't want to talk about her. Let me ask you this. Doctor Soong
created an emotion chip. Didn't Lore tell you that chip also contained
memories, memories Soong wanted you to have? <br>
DATA: Yes. It is possible that those are memories of my childhood. And
of Mrs Soong. <br>
LAFORGE: When you think about it, why would she want to lie? Why would
anybody want to pretend to be your mother? <br>
DATA: I can think of no motive for such a pretense. <br>
LAFORGE: And I can understand that this might all be a little
disconcerting for you, Data. It came out of the blue, and it doesn't
fit into your logical processors. <br>
DATA: That is true. <br>
LAFORGE: But that's life, Data. Part of being human is learning how to
deal with the unexpected. To risk new experiences even when they don't
fit into your preconceptions. <br>
DATA: I admit I am finding it difficult to accept the possibility of a
past about which I know nothing. But it is also true that I am curious
to learn more about it. </font></p>

father insisted on a son. We argued about it endlessly, right up until
we were ready to assemble you. <br>
DATA: How did you decide? <br>
JULIANA: Noonian walked in with your head in his hand and, innocent as
you please, said it was up to me. He knew perfectly well what he was
doing. Once again he had made it in his own image. What could I
possibly say? (reads door name plate) Deanna Troi, is that who you're
going to visit? <br>

(Juliana rests her hand on his shoulder) <br>
DATA: These scans indicate that the magma pockets where we plan to set
up the infusion units are somewhat unstable. <br>
JULIANA: I'm going to monitor the density of the rock layers and adjust
the strength of the particle beam as we go. That should minimise the
seismic stress that we generate while we're drilling. <br>
LAFORGE: Data, I reconfigured the phasers to create the most highly
focused particle beam possible. <br>
DATA: Thank you, Geordi. <br>
JULIANA: I'm just so pleased you've got good manners. It wasn't easy to
strike the right balance with your programming. At first you couldn't
have cared less about the social niceties like please and thank you.
You were downright rude, in fact. <br>
LAFORGE: Data? That's hard to picture. <br>
JULIANA: That was nothing to the problems we encountered. Never mind. I
don't want to embarrass you. <br>
DATA: I am incapable of embarrassment. Please continue. <br>
JULIANA: Well, the one thing we couldn't anticipate was that you didn't
seem to mind about being naked. Some of the colonists objected to
having an anatomically correct android running around without any
clothes on. We asked you to dress, but you didn't feel it was necessary
because you didn't suffer from the elements. We actually had to write a
modesty sub-routine to get you to keep your clothes on. <br>

their children's accomplishments. <br>
JULIANA: I suppose there's a certain amount of vanity involved,
considering that giving you a creative aspect was my idea. Your father
didn't really see the point. He thought that since you didn't have
emotions, there would be no real need for you to express yourself.
Somehow I had the feeling the opposite would be true. <br>

JULIANA: Yes, yes, very nice. Data, may I ask you something? <br>
DATA: Of course. <br>
JULIANA: Do you think you'll ever try to create an android again? <br>
DATA: Perhaps. I created Lal because I wished to procreate. Despite
what happened to her, I still have that wish. <br>
JULIANA: How do you know the same thing won't happen? Creating a stable
positronic matrix is very tricky. Your father lost several prototypes
before Lore. <br>
DATA: I was not aware he created other androids before my brother. <br>
JULIANA: There were three of them. They were like children to us.
Losing them was very painful. When Noonian decided to try again, I was
very much against it. I didn't think we had the right to bring a life
into the world with so little chance of surviving. But your Father was
sure that he'd figured out what went wrong, insisted he could make a
stable matrix, and he did. But Lore was cruel. Evil. Eventually we had
no choice, we had to dismantle him. Your father decided to build yet
another android, one who didn't have emotions. I couldn't believe he
would want to try again. <br>
DATA: I am that android. Are you saying you were against my creation? <br>
JULIANA: Initially I was. But I was wrong, I know that now. I've
followed your progress for years. I'm very proud of what you've
accomplished. <br>
DATA: Then why did you never attempt to contact me? <br>
JULIANA: Because I felt guilty about something I'd done. <br>
DATA: Perhaps if you told me what has made you feel this way, it may
alleviated the guilt. <br>
JULIANA: I lied. When I said there was no room for you in the escape
pod that we took from Omicron. There was. I didn't want to bring you
with us. I was afraid if we reactivated you, you'd turn out like Lore.

turned on us, despite the dreadful things he did, dismantling him was

DATA: There will be more seismic activity. We must hurry. <br>
(Data and Juliana go along a passage to where the equipment is set up) <br>
DATA: The shaft has not been obstructed by the seismic activity. It
should be possible to trigger the unit from orbit. <br>
JULIANA: The infuser's been damaged. We're going to have to start the
programming sequence all over again. <br>
DATA: Priming the energy-transfer matrix. <br>
JULIANA: Re-initialising the particle stream buffer. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Data. Are you there? <br>
DATA: Go ahead, sir. <br>
RIKER [OC]: We're reading an increase in seismic stress levels. <br>
DATA: Understood, sir. We will attempt to expedite our work. <br>
JULIANA: There. Now we just have to re-align the diverter. <br>
(another quake rocks the chamber) <br>
RIKER [OC]: Data, are you all right? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. We'll be returning to the beam-out point shortly. <br>
JULIANA: That's it. Let's go. <br>
(they go down the passage and discover everything has fallen down into
a pit) <br>
JULIANA: Can we transport without the pattern enhancers? <br>
DATA: No, we are too far below the surface. <br>
JULIANA: How are we going to get down there? <br>
DATA: There are no handholds in the rock face. We are going to have to
jump. <br>
JULIANA: No, it's too far! I won't make it! <br>
DATA: You will. <br>
(Data takes Juliana's arm and makes her jump with him. She lands badly,
is knocked out, and her arm has fallen off. It is artificial.)

LAFORGE: Basically she's a Soong-type android, except everything about
her is designed to fool you into thinking she's human. <br>
CRUSHER: She's got tear ducts, sweat glands, even veins and capillaries
underneath her skin. <br>
RIKER: Why does the scanner read her as a human? <br>
CRUSHER: Because she has a feedback processor designed to send out a
false bio-signal. <br>
LAFORGE: It's part of her aging programme. Not only does she age in
appearance like Data, her vital signs change too. <br>
CRUSHER: What I can't figure out is why she lost consciousness. As far
as I can see, everything is fine. She should be awake. <br>
DATA: Check her positronic matrix. There may be a cascade anomaly. <br>
RIKER: You said you knew she was an android. How? <br>
DATA: The first indication occurred when we were digging. I saw her
perform complex calculations without the assistance of the computer. <br>
RIKER: That could have just meant she was good at math. <br>
DATA: That is true, but it was enough to get my attention. Later, I
noticed something odd about the way she blinked her eyes. The intervals
between blinks were governed by the Fourier system, the same
mathematical formula my father used to give my blinking pattern the
appearance of randomness. <br>
RIKER: Only you could have noticed something like that. <br>
DATA: Then there was the concert in Ten Forward. <br>
RIKER: What about it? <br>
DATA: We had practised the piece, and I noticed that she played it the
same way during the performance. Every pitch, every intonation, was
exactly the same. Only an artificial life form could have done that. <br>
RIKER: Does her husband know anything about this? <br>
DATA: I do not believe so. He is on the surface monitoring the plasma
infusion. <br>
RIKER: Probably just as well. <br>
LAFORGE: Data, come take a look at this. <br>
DATA: It appears to be an information module. With a holographic
interface.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Holodeck]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Data puts Juliana's chip into a holder, then into
the holodeck arch panel) <br>
SOONG: Whoever you are, you must have found out about Juliana. <br>
DATA: That is correct. <br>
SOONG: I programmed this hologram to answer any questions you might
have. I am Noonian Soong. I created her. <br>
DATA: I am Data. <br>
SOONG: Data? I hoped somehow it might be you. I even created a response
programme to answer your questions. How are you, boy? <br>
DATA: I am fine. <br>
SOONG: I'm glad you got the chance to meet your mother. <br>
DATA: You refer to Doctor Tainer as my mother, yet the complexity of
her design indicates she was created after I was. <br>
SOONG: You're right. But there was a real Juliana O'Donnell. She was my
wife. She helped me create you. <br>
DATA: What happened to her? <br>
SOONG: She was injured when the Crystalline Entity attacked. We made it
as far as Terlina Three but, she slipped into a coma. When I realised
nothing could be done for her, I built an android. I tried to perfect
my synaptic scanning technique so that I could transfer Juliana's
memories into a positronic matrix. I didn't know if it would work, but
I had to try. I couldn't stand the thought of losing the only woman I
ever loved. A few days after Juliana died, I activated the android. She
looked up at me and smiled. She recognised me. It had worked! Here was
a life not two minutes old, and as far as she knew I was her husband.
She'd just recovered from a terrible injury. It was incredible. <br>
DATA: Then you never told her the truth? <br>
SOONG: Why? There was no reason for her to know. I wanted her to be
happy. I wanted us to be happy. We were. For a while. <br>
DATA: What happened? <br>
SOONG: I made a terrible mistake. I never really let her know how much
I loved her. So she left me. The real Juliana probably would have left
too, if she'd lived. <br>
DATA: If she recovers and learns that she is an android <br>
SOONG: She doesn't have to know. I designed her to shut down in the
event the truth was discovered. When you put that chip back in, she
will wake up and remember nothing. All you have to do is make up some
excuse about what happened to her. <br>
DATA: Then you do not believe she should know the truth? <br>
SOONG: Truth? The truth is, in every way that matters, she is Juliana
Soong. I programmed her to terminate after a long life. Let her live
out her days, and die believing she was human. Don't rob her of that,
son. Please.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: It seems that I must make a decision. Whether
to tell Doctor Tainer that she is an android or to withhold that
information from her. I do not know what to do. <br>
CRUSHER: Why was Doctor Soong so adamant that she not be told? <br>
DATA: He seemed certain that if she knew, it would preclude the
possibility of her being happy. <br>
PICARD: Data, what do you think? <br>
DATA: I am not certain. I understand why my father felt as he did, but
his wishes are not necessarily paramount. I am more concerned with what
would be best for her. <br>
CRUSHER: Wouldn't she be better off knowing the truth? Dealing with the
reality of her existence? <br>
TROI: I don't think so. She's believed she's human all her life. The
truth might be devastating to her. <br>
PICARD: Data, there might come some time in the future when she would
find out anyway. Another accident, perhaps. Maybe it would be easier
for her if she learned the truth from you. <br>
CRUSHER: I can tell you that if I were in her place, I would rather be
told by my son than by some stranger. <br>
DATA: I find I am having difficulty separating what would be best for
her from what would be best for me. <br>
TROI: What do you mean? <br>
DATA: If she knew she were an android, we would have something to
share. I would no longer be alone in the universe. <br>
TROI: I know how much that means to you, Data, but at the same time, by
telling her you're robbing her of the one thing you've wanted all your
life. To be human. <br>
PICARD: It's a difficult choice. You must do what you think best, Data.
But whatever decision you make, we will support it.

JULIANA: I would like that very much. Well, I'd better be going. <br>
DATA: There is something I thought you should know. My father told me
that he had only one great love in his life and that he regretted never
telling her how much he cared for her. I am certain he was referring to
you. <br>
JULIANA: That's nice to know. On Atrea there is a saying, that a child
born from parents who love each other will have nothing but goodness in
his heart. I guess that explains you. Take care of yourself, son. <br>
