EMI: Tell me again. <br>
QUARK: Tell you about what? <br>
EMI: About the stem bolts. <br>
QUARK: I have one hundred gross of self-sealing stem bolts sitting in
Cargo bay eleven. <br>
EMI: And they're all mine? <br>
QUARK: For only ten bars of gold-pressed latinum. <br>
EMI: Quark, you don't know how much this means to me. <br>
QUARK: You don't know how much this means to me. <br>
EMI: With those stem bolts, my family will be able to triple production
of our reverse-ratcheting routing planers. <br>
QUARK: Glad to be of help. <br>
EMI: Quark, I can't wait any longer. Why don't you and I go down to
Cargo bay eleven and sign the contract? <br>
QUARK: No need to rush. Your family's ship won't be here for a week.
We'll have plenty of time to finalise the deal before then. <br>

QUARK: I'm a very unusual Ferengi. <br>

that goes for the female as well. <br>
EMI: Is something wrong? <br>
QUARK: There's nothing wrong. Have you lost your mind? She's willing,
she's wealthy, and she's wants to buy our stem bolts. <br>

QUARK: Right now, nothing is more important than this. <br>

BASHIR: What's this? <br>
DAX: Champagne. <br>
SISKO: Congratulations, Doctor. <br>
BASHIR: Well thank you. Now will someone please tell me what's going
on? <br>
SISKO: The Federation Medical Council has announced the nominees for
this year's Carrington Award. And the nominees are, Doctor April Wade
of the University of Nairobi, Healer Senva of the Vulcan Medical
Institute, Doctor Henri Roget of the Central Hospital of Altair Four,
Chirurgeon Ghee P'Trell of Andoria, and Doctor Julian Bashir, Chief
Medical Officer of Starbase Deep Space Nine. Good luck. <br>
BASHIR: There must be some mistake. As far as I know, my name wasn't
even up for consideration. <br>
DAX: Oh, it was up for consideration. I submitted it myself through an
old friend of Curzon's. <br>
KIRA: You deserve the nomination, Doctor. Your work on biomolecular
replication was both audacious and groundbreaking. According to Dax,
anyway. She's the only one who understands it. <br>
O'BRIEN: So, how does it feel to be the youngest nominee in the history
of the Carrington award? <br>
BASHIR: It feels good. Excuse me, I've got to finish some work.

nominated for the Federation's most prestigious medical award. <br>

it. <br>
DAX: It is a big deal. We're all proud of you. <br>
BASHIR: I'm glad, but before you agonise over the next few days over
the board's decision, I want to assure you that I'm not going to win. <br>
DAX: You don't know that. The work you've been doing deserves to be
recognised. <br>
BASHIR: This isn't about my work. Do you know what the life expectancy
of a Carrington Award winner is? Five years. Ten at the very best. And
do you know why? Because the Carrington Award is intended to be the
crowning achievement for a lifetime in medicine. April Wade is a
hundred and six. The last time she was nominated, three years ago,
people said it was premature. <br>
DAX: You're exaggerating. <br>
BASHIR: Maybe, a little. But the undeniable truth is I am way too young
to be a serious contender for the Carrington. Now, put my name up for
nomination in seventy years, and I promise you I will get very excited.
But until then, I don't plan on giving it much thought. <br>
DAX: That's a very mature attitude. <br>
BASHIR: You sound surprised. <br>
DAX: I'm actually astonished, but impressed. <br>
BASHIR: So then we don't have to dwell on it for the next three days. <br>
DAX: I won't mention it again. <br>
BASHIR: I appreciate that, Jadzia. <br>

<br>
QUARK: A cup of millipede juice, hold the shells. <br>
(The drink arrives) <br>
QUARK: Rom! Rom! Rom! <br>
(Rom comes out of the bathroom, using an electric toothbrush device but
for his ear.) <br>
ROM: Did you call me, brother? <br>
QUARK: Would it be too much trouble for you to put these empty bottles
in the replicator? <br>
ROM: Keeping my quarters clean is Nog's job. <br>
QUARK: Except Nog is on the Homeworld visiting his grandmother. <br>
ROM: Then cleaning will just have to wait until he gets back. <br>
QUARK: No it won't. Until the Nagus gives me back my own quarters this
is my home too, and I've had enough of this mess. Clean it up. Now. <br>
ROM: I won't. <br>
QUARK: Yes, you will. It's bad enough I've to put up with your constant
teeth grinding every night, and your incessant ear-picking. But I will
not tolerate living like some Pakled refuse merchant for another. Wait
a minute. This is a bottle of Aldeberan whiskey. <br>
ROM: Let me, brother. <br>
QUARK: I recognise this label. This is from my private stock. <br>
ROM: No, it's not. <br>
QUARK: It most certainly is. Wait a minute. What's that over there? <br>
ROM: Trixian bubble juice? <br>
QUARK: Nog's favourite. This came from my stockroom, didn't it? <br>
ROM: Are you accusing my son of being a thief? <br>
QUARK: No, I'm accusing you of being a thief. These table linens, this
chair, that table, everything in here comes from my bar. <br>
ROM: Not everything. <br>
QUARK: As soon as you're done cleaning up, I'm going to conduct a
complete inventory and find out exactly what you've stolen from me. Now
get to work. <br>
ROM: No. I refuse. I work for you all day, brother, but here I'm the
boss. You want this place cleaned up, do it yourself. <br>
QUARK: What I want is my own quarters back. <br>
ROM: That makes two of us. Living with you was bad enough when we were
children. <br>
QUARK: What do I do? <br>
ROM: You think. <br>
QUARK: What do you mean, I think? <br>
ROM: You stay up late every night, plotting and scheming. And when you
think, you mumble. And if there's anything I can't stand, it's
listening to you mumble. <br>
QUARK: That does it. I've been accommodating long enough. If the Nagus
wants to stay on the station, he's going to have to find someplace else
to live. </font></p>

opposite.) <br>
ROM: Are you sure this is a good idea? No one's seen the Nagus since he
got here. He must be working on something important. If you disturb
him, he might get very angry. <br>
QUARK: I'm not going to disturb him. You are. <br>
ROM: Me? Why not you? <br>
QUARK: Zek likes me, so I can't afford to get on his bad side. On the
other hand, he barely acknowledges your existence, so you have nothing
to lose. Now get in there and tell the Nagus he'll have to leave. And
whatever happens, don't let Maihar'du intimidate you. <br>
ROM: Where are you going? <br>
QUARK: Don't worry. If you need me, I'll be close by. <br>
ZEK: Rom! What can I do for you, my boy? <br>
ROM: Grand Nagus, forgive me for disturbing you. <br>
ZEK: Who's disturbed? I've been hoping someone would drop by. Now come
right in. <br>
QUARK: Why thank you. We'd be delighted. <br>
ZEK: Quark. I knew you'd be lurking around here someplace. Well, what
are we standing out here for? I've got something very exciting to show
you both.

ZEK: I'm glad you asked. Maihar'du, the book. <br>
(Maihar'du is sitting in a corner, looking rather worried.) <br>
ZEK: You are about to read the shining triumph of my life. The one
thing I'll always be remembered for. <br>
QUARK: May I? <br>
ZEK: By all means. <br>
QUARK: (reading) The Rules of Acquisition, Revised for the Modern
Ferengi. You rewrote the Rules of Acquisition? <br>
ZEK: I hope you like them. Absorb, enjoy. <br>
(Zek goes into the bedroom) <br>
QUARK: Rom, you know what this means? <br>
ROM: Yes. It means we're going to have to memorise a whole new set of
Rules. <br>
QUARK: No, you idiot. It means we'll be the first Ferengi to benefit
from Zek's wisdom. The knowledge contained in this book could make us
both rich beyond our wildest dreams. <br>
ROM: I'll be able to go into business for myself. Turn the page,
brother. Turn the page. <br>
QUARK: The first Rule of Acquisition is <br>
ROM: Go on. <br>
QUARK: If they want their money back <br>

QUARK: Give it to them. <br>
ROM: If they want their money back give it to them? <br>
(In the corner, Maihar'du cries.) <br>
(later) <br>
ROM: Rule number twenty one. Never place profit before friendship. Rule
number twenty tour. Latinum tarnishes, but family is forever. Rule
twenty three. Money can never replace dignity. <br>
QUARK: Oh, skip to the end. Well, what is it? <br>
ROM: You're not going to like it, Brother. <br>
QUARK: I can take it. Tell me. <br>
ROM: Rule number two hundred and eighty five. A good deed is its own
reward. <br>
(Quark starts to swoon.) <br>
ROM: Brother, are you all right? <br>
QUARK: I just have to sit down. <br>
(Rom fans him with the book.) <br>
QUARK: No, take it away. <br>
ROM: Sorry. <br>
QUARK: Got to think. Got to think. There has to be some explanation, a
reason for why he's doing this. <br>
ROM: Maybe we should ask him. <br>
QUARK: No. Don't you see? He's testing us. Yes, that must be it. It's
some kind of test. The book, the book. <br>
ROM: You want to hear more? <br>
QUARK: No, but it must be some kind of code. Read me the first word of
every Rule. <br>
ROM: If. Never. Keep. Profit. A. Good. Smile. Honesty. <br>
QUARK: If never keep profit a good smile honesty. <br>
ROM: What does it mean, brother? <br>
QUARK: It means absolutely nothing. Maybe if we hold the pages up to
the light. No, no. <br>
(Quark taps the cover, sniffs it, tastes the edges of the pages.) <br>
QUARK: No, that's not it. The answer must be right in front of us. <br>
ROM: I know. Maybe the Nagus has gone insane. <br>
QUARK: Nonsense. The Nagus is the most brilliant Ferengi alive. I've
modelled my life after him. Don't ever let me hear you speak that way
about him again. <br>
ROM: But what if he really believes all this? <br>
QUARK: How could he believe this insanity? No. It has to be part of
some brilliant, twisted, devious plan. The Nagus isn't like you and me,
Rom. He thinks ten, sometimes twenty, steps ahead. These Rules are
probably the key component in some vast plot to seize financial control
of the entire quadrant. <br>
ROM: So what do we do? <br>
QUARK: The only thing we can do. We put down this book and we walk
away. And when the Nagus feels ready, he'll inform us of his plans. But
until then, we have to act as if we know nothing. <br>
ROM: I can do that. </font></p>

<br>
QUARK: But why? <br>
ZEK: It will make everyone happy. And that will make me happy. <br>
ROM: It must all be part of his plan. Wheels within wheels, brother. <br>
QUARK: Drinks for everyone, compliments of the Grand Nagus. Is there
anything else I get you, Nagus? We just got in a shipment of quality
Hupyrian beetle snuff. <br>
ZEK: Actually, I've lost my taste for beetle snuff. It might be fun for
you and me, but it's no fun for the beetles. Oh, and by the way, Quark,
I just met the most lovely young female. She came by your quarters
looking for you. <br>
QUARK: Was her name Emi, by any chance? <br>
ZEK: She wanted me to tell you that her family's ship has arrived with
the latinum. <br>
QUARK: It's about time. Rom, watch the bar. We're finally going to get
rid of those stem bolts. <br>
ZEK: I don't think so. <br>
QUARK: But we have a contract. <br>
ZEK: Which was never signed. And frankly, Quark, you were charging an
outrageous price for those stem bolts. <br>
QUARK: She didn't seem to think so. <br>
ZEK: Well, she did once I explained it to her. <br>
QUARK: You what? <br>
ZEK: Well, I couldn't allow you take advantage of an innocent young
female like that, Quark. So I told her where she could get all the stem
bolts she needed at wholesale. <br>
QUARK: Wholesale? He told her where to get them at wholesale. What am I
going to do with a hundred gross of stem bolts? <br>
(Quark wanders off) <br>
ROM: My poor brother. <br>
ZEK: Oh, don't worry about him. Eventually, he'll sell those stem bolts
at a fair price. <br>
ROM: A fair price? I'm very confused. <br>
ZEK: That's understandable. It'll take some time to get used to the new
ways. <br>

kind of Ferengi. An evolved Ferengi. <br>
QUARK: Evolved? Into what? <br>
ROM: I'm not sure, exactly. The Nagus says that the answers lie in his
new Rules of Acquisition. He told me, Rom, it's time for the Ferengi to
move beyond greed. <br>
QUARK: Beyond greed? There's nothing beyond greed. Greed is the purest,
most noble of emotions. <br>
ROM: Greed is dead. That's the tenth Rule of Acquisition. <br>
QUARK: No, it's not. The tenth Rule of Acquisition is, Greed is

Ferengi society, and we're going to be at his side every step of the

Your name will figure prominently on all our correspondence. <br>

get the Benevolent Association established here, the Nagus plans on
returning to the homeworld, and we'll go with him. Think of it. You and
I will be there when Zek personally announces the New Rules of
Acquisition on the Grand Steps of the Sacred Marketplace. <br>

the new Rules, the Ferengi Benevolent Association, everything. <br>
ROM: It does? How? <br>
QUARK: I'm not sure, but I'm going to find out. Don't just stand there.
Talk to me. I know how you feel. What are you doing? <br>
ROM: I thought we should look inside. I mean, we don't know for certain
that there's an Orb in here. Maybe Zek's just giving them the box. <br>

from your lobes. <br>

you so paralysed with fear that you can't think straight? <br>
(Zek changes position to the second floor.) <br>
ZEK: Answer me, Quark. What are you so nervous about? Don't you think
change is worth dying for? All I want is a little leap of faith. <br>
(Zek jumps over the railing, and Quark catches the orb box.) <br>
ZEK: Nice catch. That's the wonderful thing about mysteries. Sometimes
the answers just fall from the sky. What do you have to lose? Open it. <br>

all applaud.) <br>

QUARK: Zek said the new rules were a gift. <br>
ROM: A gift from Zek to the Ferengi people. <br>
QUARK: No. A gift to Zek from them. Don't you see? They did it. They
put the idea for the New Rules in Zek's head. They changed him somehow.
<br>
ROM: They did? How dare they? Who are we talking about, brother? <br>
QUARK: The Prophets. The aliens that live inside the wormhole. They did
this to him, didn't they? <br>

QUARK: Tell me everything. <br>
ROM: Easy, brother. You know Hupyrian servants take a vow only to speak
to their masters. <br>
QUARK: You're right. Give him a handkerchief or something. I'm going to
try to break into Zek's personal logs.

from one of his contacts on Cardassia Three. From there, he headed
straight for the wormhole. His ship's log shows that he entered the
wormhole, stayed inside for only a few minutes, then reversed course
and came here. <br>
ROM: You think he went in there to talk to the Prophets? <br>
QUARK: In his personal logs, Zek said that the future was looking very
bright indeed. Don't you get it? According to Dax, the wormhole aliens
can see through time. The Nagus must've thought he could convince them
to let him see the future. That way he could anticipate economic
changes throughout the galaxy. <br>
ROM: The opportunity for profit would have been enormous. But instead
he created the New Rules of Acquisition. Why? <br>
QUARK: Something must've gone terribly wrong. But I intend to set it
right. <br>

ODO: Perhaps. But P'Trell is by no means as popular as Doctor Wade. <br>

ODO: The point is, if it's not going to be Wade, it could be anyone.
P'Trell, Senva, Roget, even you. <br>

called the Prophets? I never could figure that one out. <br>
ROM: (quarters) Did the Sisko send you? <br>
QUARK: What? Sisko? What does he have to do with anything? <br>
SISKO: (office) The Sisko taught us about corporeal lifeforms. <br>
KIRA: (Promenade) About linguistic communication. <br>

QUARK: I know all about it. He's quite a guy. But I'm not here to talk
about Sisko.&nbsp;<br>
MAIHAR'DU: (corridor) Then why are you here? <br>
QUARK: I'm here to talk about the Nagus. <br>
EMI: (quarters) The Nagus? <br>
QUARK: The other Ferengi who visited you. The one who brought the Orb. <br>
EMI: We are aware of the Zek. <br>
QUARK: He came to see you, to ask for help. He wanted to learn about
the future. <br>
SISKO: (office) The Zek wanted to know the outcome of the game before
it was played. <br>
QUARK: That's right. So what went wrong? <br>
ROM: (quarters) At first we did not understand the Zek's request. The
Sisko said that corporeal beings value their linear existence. <br>
DAX: (Quark's) The Zek wanted to understand events outside the
restrictions of linear time. <br>
QUARK: He wanted to see the future so he could gain by it. <br>
BASHIR: (Infirmary) Yes. The Zek explained the value of gain. How more
is preferable to less. <br>
QUARK: He taught you about profit. <br>
KIRA: (Promenade) We found the concept aggressive. <br>
SISKO: (office) Adversarial. <br>
EMI: (quarters) Dangerous. We could not comprehend how any species
could lead such a barren existence. <br>
QUARK: It has its advantages. <br>
MAIHAR'DU: (corridor) We don't agree. We found the Zek's adversarial
nature invasive, threatening.&nbsp;<br>
SISKO: (office) We examined your species' history, the totality of your
existence. We discovered that you have not always been as you are now. <br>
QUARK: We haven't? <br>
KIRA: (Promenade) There was a time when your peoples' acquiring nature
was not so pronounced. <br>
QUARK: Wait a second. Are you telling me that you somehow de-evolved
the Nagus? <br>
BASHIR: We restored the Zek to an earlier, less adversarial state of
existence. <br>
QUARK: You can't do that. The Nagus is the financial leader of billions
of Ferengi. I demand that you re-evolve him immediately. <br>
DAX: (Quark's) This one is adversarial too. <br>
BASHIR: Aggressive. Intrusive. <br>
SISKO: We should do to this one what we did with the other. Restore it
to a purer existence. <br>
ROM: Counteract its adversarial nature. <br>
QUARK: Wait. Let's not be hasty. There's nothing wrong with acquiring
profit. <br>
MAIHAR'DU: That is what the Zek said. <br>
QUARK: And he was right. Look, I don't know how you people live, but
all of us corporeal, linear whatevers have certain things in common,
and one of those things is the need to improve ourselves. Our ambition
to improve ourselves motivates everything we do. Without ambition,
without, dare I say it, greed, people would lie around all day doing
nothing. They wouldn't work, they wouldn't bathe, they wouldn't even
eat. They'd starve to death. Is that what you want? Are you so isolated
and detached that you would sit back and allow the extinction of every
corporeal being in the galaxy? <br>
SISKO: Your argument is specious. Changing you will not result in the
termination of all corporeal existence. <br>
QUARK: All right, so maybe I exaggerated a little. <br>
EMI: We should alter this one and return it to its own people. <br>
ROM: Agreed. It is best to avoid contact with this species. <br>
QUARK: Wait. If you don't want to have any more contact with the
Ferengi, that's fine with me. But by altering me, you won't be avoiding
contact, you'll be encouraging it. My people are very inquisitive, and
if you change me, they're going to want to know what happened. And
they're going to come here to find out. Just as I came to find out what
happened to Zek. <br>
DAX: That is linear. <br>
QUARK: And potentially very annoying to you. But on the other hand, if
you leave me alone, and you put the Nagus back the way he was when you
met him, I guarantee you you'll never have to talk with another Ferengi
again. So what do you say? <br>
KIRA: Linguistic communication is tiresome. <br>
QUARK: My point exactly. Which is why I think you should send me back <br>
