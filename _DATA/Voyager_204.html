PARIS [OC]: Paris to the Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Janeway here. <br>
PARIS [OC]: I've done an analysis of our route through Botha space.
Whenever you have a minute to check it out. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm on my way to Engineering. I'll be with you as soon as I'm
done. <br>
PARIS [OC]: Aye, Captain. <br>
NEELIX: Ah, Captain, the computer told me I'd find you on deck eleven
section four B, starboard side, and sure enough, here you are. <br>
JANEWAY: What can I do for you, Neelix? <br>
NEELIX: I assumed you'd want to talk to me. <br>
JANEWAY: About? <br>
NEELIX: About the Botha. We're headed for their space and as I've told
you, they're going to have to be handled very carefully. <br>
JANEWAY: I understand, and of course I want your counsel, but right now
I'm late for a meeting. <br>
NEELIX: I wouldn't put this off too long. We're getting closer, you
know. <br>
JANEWAY: Yes, I know. And I will be with you as soon as I can.

Sorry, I'm late. What do you have? <br>
TORRES: I think we're about ready to make our first attempt, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: If you're successful, will the Doctor be able to move freely
around the entire ship? <br>
KIM: Not exactly. The holoemitters would be set up in certain key
areas, the Bridge, Engineering. We'll be able to transfer him to those
locations. <br>
JANEWAY: In the same way we can now transfer him to the holodeck. <br>
TORRES: Exactly. But if he tries to move into an area where there's no
emitter field, he'll dematerialise. <br>
KIM: I have the holoprojector online. We're ready to start. <br>
JANEWAY: Proceed. I don't have much time. <br>
TORRES: Engineering to Sickbay. Doctor, we're ready here. <br>
EMH [OC]: I'm standing by. <br>
TORRES: Okay. Here goes. <br>
KIM: Initiating transfer. Here he comes. <br>
(The EMH appears, six inches tall.) <br>
EMH: Well, this is certainly a brilliant feat of engineering. <br>
JANEWAY: What happened? <br>
TORRES: I'd guess the imaging interface wasn't properly stabilised. <br>
KIM: Just a small oversight. No pun intended. <br>
EMH: Very amusing. <br>
JANEWAY: How long will it take you to correct this small oversight? <br>
KIM: Maybe a couple of hours. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Kim, I have to assess our navigational plan and get
ready to make contact with an alien species. I can't drop everything
whenever you call. <br>
TUVOK [OC]: Tuvok to Janeway. <br>
JANEWAY: Go ahead. <br>
TUVOK [OC]: Captain, I would like a half an hour of your time to review
the security protocols before we encounter the Botha. <br>
JANEWAY: Yes, Mister Tuvok. Somehow I will find half an hour. <br>
EMH: Excuse me, Captain. Would you come down here, please? <br>
JANEWAY: Yes? <br>
EMH: When did you last take shore leave? <br>
JANEWAY: About two months ago. <br>
EMH: Ah. How long since you've done something pleasurable, for
recreation? <br>
JANEWAY: Doctor, I know I'm a bit testy today, but I can assure you <br>
EMH: How long? <br>
JANEWAY: It's been a while. I have a holonovel programme. It helps me
unwind. I haven't had time to run it for a few weeks. <br>
EMH: Well, I want you to, now. <br>
JANEWAY: Doctor, I'm really very busy. <br>
EMH: I've checked Starfleet regulations. The Chief Medical Officer
outranks the Captain in health matters. Now I realise this may be the
first time a hologram has given an order to a captain, but I'm ordering
you to report to the holodeck, now. <br>
JANEWAY: Aye, sir. <br>
EMH: And the two of you can get busy undoing this ridiculous blunder of
yours!

BURLEIGH: Presently. <br>
JANEWAY: Lord Burleigh, is something wrong? <br>
BURLEIGH: Yes. Terribly wrong. <br>

BURLEIGH: Nothing, thank you. <br>
TEMPLETON: I see. <br>
BEATRICE: I want my tea in this cup, please. And I don't want a
cucumber sandwich. I don't like the way Cook cuts them. <br>
JANEWAY: My lord, you'll be very pleased with the children's progress
in their studies this week. Henry shows a real talent for mathematics,
and Beatrice turns out to be quite musical. <br>
TEMPLETON: Beatrice? Musical? <br>
BEATRICE: I don't know what she means. <br>
JANEWAY: She's very modest about it. I've heard her several times in
the music room, playing a lovely Mozart sonata. But whenever I ask her
to play it for me, she won't. I think her talent should be encouraged.
Would you consider lessons? <br>
BURLEIGH: I didn't know Beatrice could play the piano. <br>
(Beatrice drops the flowered tea cup.) <br>
BEATRICE: I'm sorry. <br>
HENRY: It's just a cup. Don't be a goose. <br>
BEATRICE: It's the flower cup, Mother's cup. <br>
HENRY: It doesn't matter. <br>
BURLEIGH: Mrs Templeton, please take the children to the nursery. <br>
TEMPLETON: Yes, my lord. Come. <br>
BURLEIGH: Please stay here, Mrs Davenport. <br>
JANEWAY: Beatrice is upset. I should be with her. <br>
BURLEIGH: I want you here. <br>
JANEWAY: What's happening in this house? How can you not know that
Beatrice plays the piano? Why shouldn't I go to the fourth floor?
What's up there? <br>
BURLEIGH: Those are questions you must not ask. <br>
JANEWAY: But I am asking them. I'm worried about the children. Beatrice
fantasised that her mother is still alive. <br>
BURLEIGH: Don't pursue this, I beg you. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Bridge to the Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Freeze programme. Janeway here. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: We've been hailed by a representative of the Bothan

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">NEELIX:
Captain, I knew we should have talked this morning. <br>
JANEWAY: Tell me what you know, Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: I've been in subspace contact with some old friends of mine.
Nomads, collectors, much as I used to be. They're in a position to
gather information during their travels. What they've told me doesn't
sound good. <br>
JANEWAY: In what way? <br>
NEELIX: There are lots of rumours about ships entering Bothan space,
never to be heard from again. My sources on Mithren say that they have
lost a number of vessels. They say the Botha protect their territory
fiercely. <br>
JANEWAY: But we aren't aggressors. <br>
NEELIX: I don't think they are either. They just don't want anyone
crossing their borders. <br>
JANEWAY: Will they negotiate? Will they respond to diplomacy? <br>
NEELIX: It's hard to say. There's some belief that they don't even have
a legitimate claim to the space, that they're nothing more than
pernicious, odious vandals. In which case, diplomacy would fall on deaf
ears. <br>
TUVOK: We're being hailed again, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. I'm Kathryn Janeway of the Federation Starship
Voyager. <br>
(A shadowy, back-lit figure appears.) <br>
BOTHAN [on viewscreen]: Why have you entered our space without
permission? <br>
JANEWAY: We didn't realise that this was your space. On what basis do
you claim it? <br>
BOTHAN [on viewscreen]: I have no intention of explaining myself to
you. The fact is, you're violating our territory. <br>
JANEWAY: I assure you, we mean no disrespect. We are from another part
of the galaxy. We're just trying to make our way home. <br>
BOTHAN [on viewscreen]: We'll send a ship to rendezvous with you. If
you meet the criteria, we'll consider your request. <br>
JANEWAY: Thank you. What are the criteria? <br>
BOTHAN [on viewscreen]: We'll discuss that when we meet. <br>
(Transmission ends.) <br>
PARIS: Friendly fellow. <br>
JANEWAY: At least they're willing to talk. <br>
KIM: I wonder why he wouldn't let us see his face. <br>
JANEWAY: I suspect it was a calculated move. An attempt to intimidate
us. Commander, you have the Bridge. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Neelix, join me in my Ready room. We should talk about
this meeting. <br>
NEELIX: Captain, if I may. What was the last time you ate? <br>
JANEWAY: Ate? Oh, I had some soup last night. <br>
NEELIX: Then let me suggest that we conduct our talk in the mess hall.
We're serving a sumptuous repast for lunch. <br>
(Everyone looks at Janeway.) <br>
JANEWAY: Right. Lunch it is.

Captain, you have a nasty habit of skipping meals and that can do
horrible things to your electrolyte levels. <br>
JANEWAY: I know, but sometimes I just get too busy to eat. <br>
NEELIX: All you have to do is give me a call. I'll be there in a trice
with a tray of food so delectable you won't be able to resist. I do
think I've outdone myself this time. An exquisite pate made from Seltin
wood fungus. Brine-soaked neccel strips. Deviled wood
throk. <br>
(A plate of cucumber sandwiches.) <br>
JANEWAY: Where did these come from? <br>
NEELIX: Lieutenant Hargrove asked for them. Is something wrong? <br>
JANEWAY: No, just a funny coincidence. Something I saw on the holodeck.
Thank you, Neelix. This all looks delicious. And it's bound to boost my
electrolyte levels. Where did you get that cup? <br>
(Neelix pours a drink into a flowered tea cup.) <br>
NEELIX: Why, I'm not sure. I think I found several of them in storage.
Unusual, isn't it? Captain, is everything all right? <br>
JANEWAY: It's perfectly all right, Neelix. I just have to remind myself
that coincidences do happen.

In the course of your experiments with the Doctor, have you accessed
any of the holodeck programs? <br>
TORRES: No, we're bypassing the holodecks. <br>
JANEWAY: Where did you get this holoprojector? <br>
KIM: We found several of them in storage. We've been reconfiguring them
one by one. <br>
JANEWAY: So you haven't worked directly with any of the projectors on
the holodecks? <br>
TORRES: No. <br>
JANEWAY: Is there anything you've done, anything you can think of, that
might have caused holographic objects and characters to appear outside
the holodeck? <br>
TORRES: Not that I'm aware of. <br>
JANEWAY: I was sure your experiments would explain it. <br>
TORRES: Captain, there has to be a reason why you've had these
delusions and we're going to figure out what it is. <br>
JANEWAY: The Doctor pointed out that I've been under some stress. I
can't ignore that. <br>
KIM: I think we should check out the imaging systems on the holodeck.
There might be a simple malfunction. <br>
JANEWAY: Good idea. <br>
TORRES: We can run the diagnostic from here in Engineering, but you
should activate the programme first. <br>

bounced off me, then I saw the little girl moving right into you. <br>

CHAKOTAY: Of course. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's see. There was a problem with one of the deflector
shields. You'll want to follow up on that. And Stellar Cartography was
hoping for a review of their latest report. I think Tuvok wanted to
discuss something about weapons storage. <br>

PARIS: I'm trying. <br>
KIM: The ships are powering their weapons, preparing to fire. <br>
TUVOK: That last volley took our shields down to twenty one percent. <br>
KIM: We've got damage on all decks. Reports of injuries. <br>
CHAKOTAY: All stop. <br>
TUVOK: The lead ship is hailing us, Commander. <br>
CHAKOTAY: On screen. <br>
BOTHAN [on viewscreen]: Your ship is damaged and your captain
incapacitated. I will accept your immediate surrender. <br>
JANEWAY: You're not getting one. The Captain is fine. <br>
BOTHAN [on viewscreen]: I don't think so. I think the battle is over
now. <br>
(The figure walks forward into the light.) <br>
JANEWAY: Mark. <br>
MARK [on viewscreen]: Don't you recognise the man you love? <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Paris, who do you see on the viewscreen? <br>
PARIS: It's my father. <br>
ADMIRAL PARIS [on viewscreen]: I hope you've been behaving yourself. <br>
KIM: I see my girlfriend, Libby. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Kim, shut down visual. <br>
KIM: I'm trying, Captain. It won't terminate. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok, do a multiphasic scan on those ships. I want any
evidence of defensive weakness. And prepare the forward photon
torpedoes for launch. Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: I do not understand how this can be. <br>
T'PEL [on viewscreen]: Don't try to understand, Tuvok. Just accept it.
We're together again. <br>
TUVOK: No. You are not my wife. <br>
T'PEL [on viewscreen]: Of course I am. I am T'Pel. And there, right in
front of you, is your lute. The one you used to play for me. And look.
Look around you. You're back home, on Vulcan. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok? Tuvok, answer me. Tuvok! <br>
(Tuvok is still.) <br>
KIM: Captain, I'll do it. Running a multiphasic scan. <br>
TORRES [OC]: Torres to the Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Janeway here. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TORRES:
People are becoming delusional. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: It's happening her too. <br>
TORRES: I think I know why. There's a massive energy field coming from
those ships. It's bioelectric, modulating on a delta wave frequency. It
has psionic properties, and it's permeating the hull.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
A psionic field has a psychoactive effect. That would explain the

The shields, but in the meantime, I'm going to set up a resonance burst
from the warp core. That will probably block the field, but it'll take
a while to set up. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Notify the Doctor. If the field is bioelectric, he might have some
ideas how to neutralise it. Commander, give Lieutenant Torres a hand in
Engineering. Mister Neelix, if the crew ever needed a morale officer,
now's the time. See if you can help. <br>
(Chakotay leaves.) <br>
NEELIX: Aye, Captain. <br>
MARK [on viewscreen]: Kath, do you always have to be the captain? Can't
you relax for a minute? I want to talk to you. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Kim, remodulate the shields on a rotating frequency. <br>
(But Kim is lost.) <br>
JANEWAY: Janeway to Kes. <br>
KES [OC]: Yes, Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: Can you come to the Bridge? I think we could use you. <br>
KES [OC]: Right away. <br>
JANEWAY: Paris, are you still with me? <br>
PARIS: Sure am, Captain. I'm running the scans on those ships. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll work on the shields. I suggest you don't look at the
viewscreen. <br>

How's it going down here? <br>
TORRES: Not good. I can't get a response from anybody. It's like
they're catatonic. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's the same all over the ship. On my way here, I must have
seen fifty people just sitting, staring. <br>
TORRES: A few minutes ago, there was a momentary interruption in the
psionic field. Were there any indications that the alien somehow came
on board? <br>
JANEWAY: I'll find out. Chakotay to Janeway. Chakotay to the Captain.
Please respond. Chakotay to anyone on the Bridge. Kim, Paris, anybody.
We may be the last ones left. <br>
TORRES: What do we do? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I think we should take an escape pod. We passed an M Class
planet yesterday. The pod should get us there in a week. We can try to
get help. <br>
TORRES: A week? That might be too late. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It may be our only hope. If we stay here, we'll end up like
the others. <br>
TORRES: No, I have to keep trying to set up the resonance burst. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Do I have to give you an order? <br>
TORRES: I can't believe you're saying this. You know we have to stay
here and try to help the others. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I want you with me. <br>
TORRES: You aren't Chakotay. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm the Chakotay you want me to be. The one who loves you.
This is what you want, isn't it? The secret you've been keeping? You
want us to be together. (he kisses her) And we can be. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
Captain, I'm getting results from the scans. No apparent defensive
weaknesses. Metallurgical analysis is inconclusive. <br>
JANEWAY: I can't remodulate the shields. Try moving us out of here. If
we can get some distance between us and those ships, we might be able
to block the effects. <br>
PARIS: Yes, ma'am. <br>
ADMIRAL PARIS: This time let's see if you can do it without causing an
accident. You usually manage to make a mess of everything you do. <br>
PARIS: Let me say something I've always wanted to say. Get out of my
life. <br>
ADMIRAL PARIS: I'm just telling you what you already know. When the
going gets tough, you crumble. <br>
PARIS: Not any more. Not any more. <br>
ADMIRAL PARIS: You don't really believe that. In your heart, you
believe you'll fail again. And of course you will. You can't do
anything right. You'll fail. Why even try? <br>

there? Engineering respond. If anyone in Engineering can hear me, I'm

JANEWAY: I don't know who you are, what you are, but I won't let you
touch me. <br>
MARK: What about the man on the holodeck? You didn't seem to mind him
touching you, did you? In fact, I think you liked it. Now I ask you,
Kath, is that fair to me? I've stayed faithful to you. I've vowed to
wait for you no matter how long it takes. Shouldn't you do the same? <br>

understand the basic principle behind her plan. How hard can it be? <br>

KES: Doctor, we have to set up this resonance burst as quickly as
possible. I've started hallucinating. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: Then see if Lieutenant Torres's last programme is
active. <br>
KES: I think I have it. B'Elanna was writing a programme to open a
symmetrical warp field. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: All right. You'll have to sequence the magnetic
plasma constriction to the following formula. T equals C sub-one over
theta times P sub-E. <br>
KES: Er, how do I do that? <br>
EMH [on monitor]: I'm not sure. Wait a minute. I'll see if I can access
Starfleet's interactive database. <br>
NEELIX: Sweeting! Thank goodness I found you. Are you all right? <br>
KES: Where have you been? <br>
NEELIX: In the mess hall, trying to help the poor souls there. <br>
KES: Why didn't you answer the Doctor's hails? <br>
NEELIX: I didn't hear them. The comm. system must be down. And frankly,
I was a little busy. Ashmore thought I was a Kazon. Tried to kill me
with a carving knife. <br>
KES: How do I know you're really Neelix? <br>
NEELIX: Who else would I be? Kes, all I want to do is protect you, to
keep you safe. We have to get away from here, get to my shuttle. <br>
KES: Doctor, have you figured out how I can enter that sequencing code?
<br>
EMH [on monitor]: It's quite simple, really. Do you know where the
command module is? <br>
KES: Of course. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: Activate it and select magnetic plasma sequencing. <br>
NEELIX: You're becoming annoying. <br>
KES: I've got it. It's activated. Now it's asking me to enter the core
temperature. <br>
NEELIX: Move away from that console. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: Now, we need a temperature high enough to emit the
resonance burst, but not so high as to irradiate everyone on the ship.
Try three million Kelvins. <br>
(Kes screams as her face and hands break out in oozing sores.) <br>
EMH [on monitor}: Kes, look at him. <br>
KES: It hurts! <br>
EMH [on monitor]: Look at him. Focus. <br>
KES: I can't. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: Yes, you can. The mirror, remember? <br>
KES: It hurts too much! <br>
EMH [on monitor]: Kes, look at him. <br>

NEELIX: What's the matter, Kes? Can't lift your head? <br>
KES: Focus. <br>
(Kes looks at Neelix, and transfers the sores to him.) <br>
NEELIX: Stop it! <br>
(Neelix collapses and turns into the Bothan. Kes turns the monitor back
on.) <br>
KES: I'm all right now, Doctor, and I've entered a temperature of three
million Kelvin. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: Then all you have to do is activate the warp field. <br>
KES: All right. Here we go. <br>
(A burst of energy leaves Voyager. The crew start to wake up.) <br>
KES: Kes to the Captain. If you can hear me, please report to
Engineering. <br>
TORRES: What happened? <br>
KES: It's a long story, but I think everything's all right now. <br>
TORRES: Is that who's responsible for all this? <br>
KES: Apparently. He looks so harmless. It's hard to believe he almost
destroyed us. <br>
(Torres points a phaser at the waking Bothan.) <br>
BOTHAN: You're a powerful little thing. I must say, you surprised me. <br>
JANEWAY: Why did you do this to us? <br>
BOTHAN: Because I can. <br>
JANEWAY: Is it just telepathy, or is there technology involved? <br>
BOTHAN: Does it matter? <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, it matters to me, because I don't intend to let you
continue preying on others. <br>
BOTHAN: How would you propose to stop me? <br>
JANEWAY: We could destroy your technology. Or adjust your brain wave
patterns to prevent telepathy. And then we could turn you over to the
government of Mithren. We could even keep you confined in our brig
behind a force field. <br>
BOTHAN: I'm sure you're very well-intentioned, Captain, and I'd like to
be able to accommodate you but you see, I'm not really here. <br>

I'm surprised to see you here, Captain. Isn't this the day that you're
usually in the holodeck with your novel? <br>
JANEWAY: I thought, after our recent experience, that I'd take a break
from fantasy for a while. <br>
TORRES: I don't blame you. I think it had quite an impact on all of us.
Do you think it's true? That the alien was reading our minds, creating
images from our own experiences? <br>
JANEWAY: It seemed that way. He had uncanny ability to bring buried
thoughts out into the open. Why? <br>
TORRES: Oh, it's just, I experienced something I'd rather not admit. <br>
JANEWAY: I know. Me too. But, in a way, maybe he did us all a favour.
Maybe it's better to look those feelings in the eye than to keep them
locked up inside. <br>
TORRES: I guess. I'll have to think about that. I have an early watch
tomorrow, so I'd better turn in. Good night, Captain. <br>
