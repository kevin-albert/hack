DATA: Geordi? <br>
LAFORGE: In here, Data. <br>

LAFORGE: Got her now. She's trapped. Come on out of there, you. Hey,
don't you spit at me. <br>
DATA: Why is Spot under the bed? <br>
LAFORGE: Probably because she knows if I catch her, I'm going to kill
her. <br>
DATA: Has Spot been misbehaving? <br>
LAFORGE: So far she's broken a vase, a teapot, she's ruined one of my
chairs using it as a scratch post, and she's coughing hairballs up all
over my carpet. <br>
DATA: These incidents are common to cat owners. When you borrowed Spot,
you said you wanted to experience the full range of feline behaviour
before getting a cat yourself. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, well, I'm not ready. You can take her back with my
blessings. Go ahead, call her. <br>
DATA: Spot does not respond to verbal commands. <br>
LAFORGE: She won't come when you call her? Data, have you ever
considered training this cat? <br>
DATA: I never found it to be necessary. <br>
LAFORGE: Necessary? Data, the cat is out of control. Half the time I
wasn't sure if she was going to lick me or scratch my face off. <br>
DATA: I have never experienced this kind of behaviour in Spot. Although
she does have the unfortunate habit of jumping on my computer console
when I am working. <br>
LAFORGE: She needs training. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Riker to senior staff. Please report to the Observation
lounge. Mission briefing in ten minutes. <br>
LAFORGE: Right, we have to get her out of here. I'll scare her. You
grab her when she comes out, okay? <br>
DATA: I do not think it would be wise to startle her. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, Stardate 47310.2. We're
investigating the disappearance of the Medical Transport Fleming
somewhere in the Hekaras Corridor. Our search is complicated by the
unique properties of this particular region of space.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Observation lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: The Fleming's last contact with Starfleet
was four days ago. According to them, there was nothing out of the
ordinary when they entered the Corridor. <br>
PICARD: Data. <br>
(Data explains the wall monitor display) <br>
DATA: The unusually intense tetryon fields in this sector pose a severe
navigational hazard to
warp driven vessels. The Hekaras Corridor is the only route through the
area which is free of tetryon fields. Ships travelling at warp must use
the Corridor to ensure safe passage through the region. <br>
PICARD: How long will it take to complete a level one search? <br>
DATA: At least two days, sir. The Corridor is over twelve light years
long, and the surrounding tetryon interference will limit our sensor
range. <br>
WORF: Could we send out reconnaissance probes to supplement the
sensors? <br>
LAFORGE: They won't be very effective. The interference will make it
difficult to maintain contact with the probes. The best we can do is to
increase sensor efficiency. We've installed multiphase buffers on all
the sensor modules, Captain. It should help a little. <br>
TROI: Hekaras Two is inhabited, isn't it? Maybe they've had contact
with the Fleming. <br>
RIKER: They haven't. I've already spoken to the Hekaran government.
According to them, only one ship has passed through the system in the
last week. It was a Ferengi trader. <br>
CRUSHER: The Fleming was carrying a supply of rare biomimetic gel,
which is very valuable. Is it possible that the Ferengi might have
hijacked it? <br>
RIKER: I wouldn't put it past them. I think we should prepare for that
contingency. <br>
PICARD: I agreed. All right then. Mister Worf, initiate your search
pattern. Let's head in.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(La Forge is doing something with a device to the
dilithium crystals) <br>
DATA: Geordi, there has been a slight drop in sensor efficiency.
Perhaps we should examine the phase buffers. <br>
LAFORGE: No problem, Data. I'll be right with you. Okay, Hansen,
transfer EPS conduit thirteen to the stabiliser matrix. <br>
HANSEN: Aye, sir. <br>
DATA: Is there a problem with the engines? <br>
LAFORGE: No. <br>
DATA: Then why are you stabilizing the EPS conduit? <br>
LAFORGE: I'm just trying to get a slightly higher power conversion
level. <br>
DATA: But that would not affect the engines in any way. <br>
LAFORGE: I know that, Data. It's not the point. <br>
DATA: What is the point? <br>
LAFORGE: I'm just trying to get a higher conversion level, that's all. <br>
DATA: Why? <br>
LAFORGE: You know the Intrepid? <br>
DATA: Yes. <br>
LAFORGE: Well, their Chief Engineer is Commander Donald Kaplan. He and
I went through the Academy together. I just like to make sure that our
power conversion levels are a little higher than theirs. <br>
DATA: I understand. You are in competition with Mister Kaplan. <br>
LAFORGE: You might say that. This is the flagship. We should be better
than everybody else. <br>
DATA: Then you are trying to outperform the Intrepid. <br>
LAFORGE: Actually it's more a point of personal pride. These are my
engines. And there's nothing wrong with a little friendly rivalry.
Okay. Computer, how much have the conversion levels increased? <br>
COMPUTER: Levels are unchanged. <br>
LAFORGE: All right, I'll deal with of this later. Let me give you a
hand with those sensors.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(at a panel in a junction) <br>
LAFORGE: How's that? <br>
DATA: One moment. The phase buffer is functioning within normal
parameters. Sensor efficiency has increased by six point seven percent.
<br>
LAFORGE: Six point seven? One of the stages must still be out of
alignment. Let's try junction A nine. <br>
(they climb down one level) <br>
DATA: Geordi, I have taken your suggestion regarding Spot. <br>
LAFORGE: Coming down. <br>
DATA: I have begun training her. <br>
LAFORGE: Really? <br>
DATA: Yes. I am studying several new techniques. <br>
(crawling along) <br>
DATA: I began with simple conditioned response exercises and followed
with environmental enhancement. Next I plan to explore bioconditioning
devices. <br>
LAFORGE: Devices? <br>
DATA: Such as sensor nets for behaviour modification or biofeedback
motivators. Unfortunately, I have been less than successful. <br>
LAFORGE: I've got an idea. How about a phaser? A low stun setting at
just the right moment might do the trick. <br>
DATA: Geordi. I cannot stun my cat. <br>
LAFORGE: I was kidding, Data. (at a panel) Let's see what we've got.
No, this isn't it, either. <br>
DATA: Clearly there is a misalignment somewhere in this system. <br>
LAFORGE: That's for sure. Well, we've got one more possibility.
Junction C twelve. <br>
DATA: I am somewhat concerned that my training efforts will ultimately
fail. <br>
LAFORGE: Maybe you're just going about it the wrong way, Data. <br>
DATA: I have consulted numerous animal training manuals. Some of them
claim that cats are inherently untrainable. <br>
LAFORGE: I don't believe that for a second. Listen to me. My sister
didn't know a thing about animals and she was able to train her cat.
How complicated could it be? <br>
DATA: What did she train her cat to do? <br>
LAFORGE: She had that cat jumping into her arms on command. <br>
DATA: Interesting. Perhaps I could modify your sister's techniques to
keep Spot from jumping on console. Do you know how she was able to
train her cat? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, as I recall, she walked around for two months with a
piece of tuna in her blouse. <br>
(at the next junction) <br>
LAFORGE: I was right. This buffer is out of alignment. Okay, try that. <br>
DATA: Phase alignment is stabilised. However, sensor efficiency has
increased by only an additional one point three percent. <br>
LAFORGE: It's not much, but every little bit going to help. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Data. <br>
DATA: Data here. <br>
RIKER [OC]: We're picking up a ship ahead on long range sensors. If you
and Geordi are through down there, we'd like to have you on the Bridge.
<br>
LAFORGE: We're not going to squeeze anything else out of these systems.
<br>
DATA: Acknowledged, sir. We are on our way.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: We are within visual range, sir. <br>
PICARD: On screen. <br>
WORF: It is a Ferengi transport ship, D'Kora class. <br>
RIKER: That's the same Ferengi vessel that entered the Corridor a week
ago. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, there are no emissions from their plasma vents. Their
warp drive must be completely inactive. <br>
DATA: That is correct, sir. Their impulse system is down as well, Power
generation is at extremely low levels. <br>
PICARD: What about life signs? <br>
DATA: Life support systems are also functioning at low levels. There
are approximately four hundred fifty Ferengi on board. That is a
standard complement for a ship of that class. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, open a hailing frequency. <br>
WORF: There is no response on any channel, sir. <br>
LAFORGE: I'm not picking any subspace emissions from the ship at all,
Captain. It looks like every one of their field coils has been
overloaded. <br>
RIKER: That would explain why they haven't respond to our hails. <br>
DATA: It would also explain the failure of their warp drive. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, Ferengi sensors are still online. I could modify one
of our deflector emitters to transmit old style delta waves. If I
modulate that with a comm. signal, the Ferengi should be able to pick
that up. <br>
PICARD: Make it so. <br>
RIKER: If they did hijack the Fleming, they sure didn't get very far
with the cargo. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, have tractor beams standing by. We may have to
take them under tow. Helm, take us within tractor range. <br>
HELM: (female) Aye, sir. <br>
WORF: Captain, I am picking up power emissions from the Ferengi ship.
They are locking weapons. <br>
PICARD: Shields up. <br>
(the Enterprise gets hit) <br>
RIKER: Ready phasers. Prepare to return fire. <br>
PICARD: Target their weapons array only. <br>
WORF: Phasers locked. <br>
PICARD: Fire. <br>
DATA: Direct hit. Their weapon systems are down. <br>
PICARD: Damage report. <br>
WORF: We sustained minimal damage to decks five and seven, sir. <br>
DATA: Sir, the Ferengi ship's power has stabilised. They appear to have
impulse capability. <br>
RIKER: They were just playing dead. Conserving power until we got in
close enough. <br>
PICARD: But why would they attack us in the first place? <br>
RIKER: Somehow I don't think they'll let us beam over there and ask
them. <br>
PICARD: Mister La Forge, how are you coming with that comm. link? <br>
LAFORGE: Almost ready, Captain. All right, let's give it a try. <br>
PICARD: Open a channel. <br>
(a fuzzy viewscreen image that La Forge cleans up) <br>
PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. Will you
please explain why you attacked us? <br>
PRAK [on viewscreen]: Our attack? We were defending ourselves. Do you
deny that you are responsible for disabling my vessel? <br>
PICARD: DaiMon, your ship was adrift, your communications inoperative.
We were attempting to assess your status. <br>
PRAK [on viewscreen]: You were attempting to move in for the kill. Do
not toy with me, Picard. We are obviously at your mercy, but know this.
When the Ferengi Council learns of your actions, they will consider
this an act of war. <br>
PICARD: DaiMon, clearly there has been some misunderstanding. I think
it would be in all interests if you were to come aboard and we discuss
this situation. <br>
PRAK [on viewscreen]: I see no reason to trust you, human. <br>
PICARD: In that case, we'll be on our way. I'll relay your position to
your government if you wish, in case you're unable to complete your
repairs and you remain stranded. <br>
PRAK [on viewscreen]: Perhaps it would be better to discuss the
situation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PRAK: We detected what appeared to be a Federation
signal buoy. When we approached it, it emitted a massive verteron
pulse. Our warp drive, our sensors, our communications systems were all
disabled. We assumed we were the victims of a new Federation weapon. <br>
PICARD: The Federation established this corridor to ensure safe access
through this sector. We have nothing to gain from mining it. <br>
RIKER: Whatever happened to your ship may not have been an isolated
incident. A Federation Medical transport was recently lost in that
corridor. <br>
PRAK: We passed a Federation ship several days ago. It did not appear
to be in any distress. <br>
RIKER: Can you give us an idea of its heading? <br>
PRAK: It is possible that information was recorded in our sensor logs,
Commander. Unfortunately, my entire crew is occupied with our repairs.
I don't think there will be time to search our records. <br>
PICARD: DaiMon, if we assigned an Engineering team to assist you with
your repair efforts, would that give you time to retrieve your logs? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: You have made a very serious accusation. I
want you to explain it. <br>
RABAL: Captain, according to our research, warp fields cause a
dangerous reaction in this region of space. <br>
SEROVA: Our planet is already being affected. We have measured large
gravitational shifts throughout our system. <br>
RABAL: If something isn't done, our planet will become uninhabitable. <br>
LAFORGE: Captain, I've heard this theory before. Their research was
evaluated by the Federation Science Council a few years ago. Quite
frankly, it didn't hold up. <br>
SEROVA: That research was only preliminary. Our original analysis was
incomplete. <br>
PICARD: If you wanted us to review your research, you should have made
a request through the Science Council. <br>
RABAL: Their resources are limited. It would have taken over a year
before they dispatched a science ship to come and evaluate our work. <br>
SEROVA: We were not willing to wait any longer. We knew that if we
disabled enough ships, Starfleet would come. Then at least we would be
able to present our case. <br>
RIKER: That's how you rationalise these attacks? <br>
SEROVA: Neither you nor the Ferengi suffered any casualties, Commander.
The actual damage to your vessels was negligible. <br>
RABAL: We dispersed verteron probes in the Corridor merely to disable
warp-driven ships. Nothing more. <br>
RIKER: You can call it whatever you like. The fact remains you
deliberately disguised your probes. You made them look like signal
markers. You hid them in debris field. You mined the Corridor. <br>
PICARD: Mister La Forge, how long do you estimate it will take to
restore the engines? <br>
LAFORGE: Their verteron pulse overloaded our field coils, Captain.
It'll take at least thirty six hours to get underway. <br>
SEROVA: I know precisely how our pulse affected your field coils. With
my help, your ship could be operational in ten hours. Provided you
agree to review our research. <br>
PICARD: Because of the seriousness of your claim, I'm willing to listen
to your case. But let there be no mistake. Our priority here is the
recovery of the Fleming. Now I expect you to help us restore our
engines and deactivate all of the remaining probes in the Corridor. If
you do not, you will both be taken to the brig and from there to the
nearest Starbase, where you will answer charges for what you have done.
<br>
RABAL: My sister and I do not wish to impede your rescue process. <br>
SEROVA: Rabal, don't. The probes are the only leverage we have. If we <br>
RABAL: Serova. We will do as you ask, Captain. But please, re-examine
our data. <br>
PICARD: We will. It is part of our job to retain an open mind, even
under these circumstances. Mister La Forge, take them to Engineering.
Get the core back online. <br>
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, I want you to review their research. I'd like your

take at least a week to recalibrate them properly. <br>
SEROVA: I'm sorry you've been inconvenienced. But that's all it is, an
inconvenience. Our concerns are much more important than the condition
of your engines. <br>
LAFORGE: What if the Fleming had been transporting perishable supplies
or was on an emergency mission? Your little plan might have cost a lot

what we're trying to do. <br>

RABAL: Commander, I know my sister can be somewhat, er, aggravating. <br>
LAFORGE: I'd have to agree with that. <br>
RABAL: But please, try to understand. She believes profoundly in this
cause. She has sworn to dedicate her life to exposing the dangers of
warp drive. <br>
LAFORGE: Warp drive has been around for three centuries. It's a proven
technology. <br>
RABAL: And you sound just like I did, about four years ago. <br>
LAFORGE: You mean you didn't believe her either? <br>
RABAL: No. What I didn't realise was just how brilliant my sister is.
It took two years of study for me even to grasp the principles behind
her theoretical models. They're that sophisticated. <br>
LAFORGE: Well our Commander Data's no slouch. If there's anything
there, he'll find it. <br>
RABAL: Well I hope so, because once we persuade Starfleet to stop warp
travel through the Corridor, we're going to have to convince our own
people to give up warp drive completely. <br>
LAFORGE: Hekaras Two is the only inhabited world in this region.
Without warp drive, you'd be completely isolated from the rest of the
Federation. Are you really willing to take that step? <br>
RABAL: Yes. And if you were in my position, I hope you'd be willing to
do the same thing.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Stellar Cartography]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Serova and Rabal believe there are regions of
potential subspace instability within the Corridor. They believe that
if these regions continue to be exposed to warp field energy, they will
rupture. Subspace will extrude into normal space, forming a rift. <br>
PICARD: It's like pacing up and down on the same piece of carpet.
Eventually you wear it out. <br>
DATA: That analogy is essentially correct, sir. <br>
PICARD: Can this theory be proven? <br>
DATA: Not at this time, sir. There is insufficient evidence to do so.
In order to determine whether or not a rift will form, region must be
exposed to warp field energy approximately one million times greater
than that normally generated by a starship. <br>
RABAL: Commander, we believe the warp field effect is cumulative. Each
starship that passes through the Corridor at warp brings us one step
closer to forming a rift. <br>
DATA: I agree that is a possibility. Captain, I suggest we ask the
Federation Science Council to send a research vessel to this area. A
more detailed investigation would resolve many of our questions. <br>

WORF: Captain, the Hekaran ship is moving off. There is one person on

PICARD: Mister Worf, open a channel. <br>
RABAL: Serova, what are you trying to do? <br>
SEROVA [on viewscreen]: They wanted proof. I'm going to give it to
them. I'm sorry. <br>
DATA: Captain, the Hekaran ship's engines are beginning to overload. I
believe Serova's attempting to create a warp core breach. <br>
RABAL: No! <br>
RIKER: Prepare for impact. <br>
(KaBOOM! and a purple afterglow) <br>
RIKER: Shields at maximum. Full reverse. <br>
PICARD: Report! <br>
DATA: We have cleared the shock wave. However, tetryon flux in the area
is increasing rapidly. <br>
(there's a swirly thing in the middle of the purple) <br>
RIKER: It's incredible. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, what's your analysis? <br>
DATA: The event is approximately zero point one light years in
diameter, and it is emitting extremely high levels of tetryon
radiation. It appears to be what Rabal and Serova predicted, a subspace
rift. <br>
LAFORGE: She was right. <br>
PICARD: Can you get a fix on the Fleming? Is she still in one piece? <br>
DATA: Scanning. The Fleming is near its previous coordinates. It
appears to be intact, but it is now within the rift. <br>
PICARD: Doctor, is it possible for a ship to survive in there? Doctor.
I'm sorry about your loss but we need your help now. <br>
RABAL: Of course, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Does the rift pose any danger to the Fleming? <br>
RABAL: I don't know. <br>
(Enterprise shakes) <br>
RIKER: What was that? <br>
LAFORGE: Some kind of high energy distortion wave. Looks like they're
being generated from within the rift. <br>
DATA: IF we maintain our current position, our shields should provide
sufficient protection. <br>
PICARD: What about the Fleming? How long can they survive in there? <br>
DATA: The waves are even more intense within the rift. I estimate her
shields will fail in approximately twelve hours. <br>
RIKER: Can we risk going in there to get them out? <br>
LAFORGE: Not at warp, Commander. According to these readings, the rift
is in a state of accelerating instability which would make it extremely
sensitive to warp field energy. If we go in at warp, we might make it
expand even further. <br>
RIKER: I don't think we have a choice. It would take weeks to reach
them at impulse. <br>
PICARD: I want some better options. Data, Geordi, take Doctor Rabal and
begin an analysis of the rift. We need to find some way to get the
Fleming out of there.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: Everything here supports Serova's
theories. I can't find any way to close the rift or even reduce its
size. <br>
(rumble and shake) <br>
DATA: Doctor, is it possible there are areas inside the rift which are
stable, where we can safely use our warp engines? <br>
RABAL: Perhaps. Computer, scan the rift for regions of low instability.
<br>
(off the monitor display) <br>
RABAL: There's no area stable enough to withstand a warp pulse. <br>
LAFORGE: Wait a minute. This is strange. Computer, display grid delta
seventeen. Enhance and magnify. What do you make of that? <br>
RABAL: It's a subspace instability outside the rift. <br>
DATA: That should not be possible. <br>
RABAL: Commander, I'm going to begin a field enhanced scan of this
sector. I'd like to take a closer look at this. <br>
LAFORGE: In the meantime, we'd better tell the Captain we don't know
how to get to the Fleming. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: I suggest we coast into the rift. <br>
RIKER: Coast? <br>
DATA: We can initiate a brief, high intensity warp pulse from our
current position. We should be able to attain sufficient velocity to
enter the rift, beam the crew off the Fleming and exit without using
our warp engines. <br>
RIKER: All right, let's say we initiate a full power warp pulse. How
much time do we need to drop out of warp? <br>
DATA: If we field saturate the nacelles, we should be able to sustain
warp speed for approximately two minutes. <br>
RIKER: That doesn't give us much time, and it could get pretty rough in
there. <br>
DATA: The timing will be critical. <br>
PICARD: Begin your calculations, Mister Data. We'll go as soon as
you're ready. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: I believe the maximum saturation level should
be eighteen point three percent. <br>
LAFORGE: All right. With these parameters, we should be able to
maintain warp speed for two minutes eight seconds. I don't think we can
get any more than that. <br>
DATA: I agree. But based on the size of the rift, it should give us
sufficient time to complete the rescue. Computer, initiate nacelle
field saturation. <br>
LAFORGE: How did we miss it, Data? <br>
DATA: I beg your pardon? <br>
LAFORGE: How did we miss the connection between warp drive and the
formation of the rift? Between the two of us we've logged thousands of
hours on these engines. We're supposed to be warp field experts. We
certainly were wrong this time. <br>
DATA: Technically, Geordi, we were not wrong. Serova's theories rested
on assumptions which were unprovable. <br>
LAFORGE: Seems to me she managed to prove them pretty conclusively. <br>
DATA: By using methods any reputable scientist would never employ. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, she was willing to die to make her point. We should have
listened to her more closely, Data. <br>
DATA: We reviewed Serova's research to the best of our abilities, and
we were prepared to continue studying the problem. But that was not
satisfactory. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, I can remember times when I was a little stubborn,
trying to get people to believe me when I didn't have enough proof. <br>
DATA: I do not believe that you would have resorted to such extremes. <br>
LAFORGE: But she had to, just to get us to listen. Why was I so
resistant? <br>
DATA: Perhaps because her aggressive methods created an adversarial
situation. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah. Maybe I was taking the whole thing personally. <br>
DATA: I do not understand. <br>
LAFORGE: Maybe I was a little threatened. The thought that warp engines
might be doing some kind of damage. It's going to take another half an
hour for the nacelles to saturate. Will you call me when they're done? </font></p>

RABAL: Thank you. I'm trying to tell myself that she died for what she
believed in, but somehow that isn't much comfort. <br>
LAFORGE: I wish it could have happened differently. Maybe I should have
looked at the research more closely. It's possible there's something
that I missed. <br>
RABAL: No. You didn't miss anything. The problem was time. We needed
more time to do the proper research. Serova wasn't willing to wait. <br>
LAFORGE: No. I guess the question is now, where do we go from here? <br>
RABAL: I don't think we can look at space travel the same way anymore.
We're going to have to change. <br>

projected where subspace rifts will be most likely to be formed over

they'll look in ten years. Twenty years. Thirty years. Forty years. <br>

(a crewman hands Picard a PADD)&nbsp;<br>
PICARD: Ah. We've received new directives from the Federation Council
on this matter. Until we can find a way to counteract the warp field
effect, the Council feels our best course is to slow the damage as much
as possible. Therefore, areas of space found susceptible to warp fields
will be restricted to essential travel only, and effective immediately
all Federation vessels will be limited to a speed of warp five, except
in cases of extreme emergency. <br>
WORF: The Klingons will observe these restrictions, but the Romulans
will not. <br>
TROI: And what about the Ferengi? And the Cardassians, for that matter?

PICARD: The Federation's sharing all our data with warp-capable
species. We can only hope that they realise it's in their own interests
and take similar action. <br>

rifts from forming. What are we going to do about this one? <br>

Hekaras Two. It's only a temporary solution, but it should suffice for
now. <br>

it did. It gives us some time to consider our options. <br>

exploring space. I've charted new worlds, I've met dozens of new
species. And I believe that these were all valuable ends in themselves.
Now it seems that all this while, I was helping to damage the thing
that I hold most dear. <br>
