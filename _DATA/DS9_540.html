O'BRIEN: She's down fifty strips. <br>
WORF: Not for long. <br>
O'BRIEN: What makes you so sure? <br>
WORF: Jadzia is playing a very deep game. Her strategy will become
apparent any moment now. <br>
O'BRIEN: I see. You have absolutely no idea how this game is played, do
you? <br>
WORF: No. But I have developed a new appreciation for it. <br>
O'BRIEN: Since when? <br>
WORF: Since I married a tongo player. But one thing I am certain about,
she will defeat the Ferengi bartender. <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't know about that. Quark's on a roll. In the last month,
he's won two hundred and six straight games. <br>
WORF: Would you care to make a wager on the outcome? <br>
O'BRIEN: I wouldn't want to bet against a man's wife. <br>

QUARK: Perish the thought. I just hate to kick somebody when they're

DAX: Because I wanted to recalibrate the external sensors before the
nightwatch comes on duty. <br>

DAX: I think that'll work. Oh, the Sutherland is going to be here the
day after tomorrow and <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRA: We don't have a lot of time, so I'll get
right to it. For the last two months, Starfleet has been receiving
military intelligence from a Cardassian operative. That operative has
now sent an emergency signal indicating he needs to speak to someone in
a face to face conversation. In thirteen hours, he'll beam an encrypted
subspace transmission to these coordinates in the Badlands. <br>
DAX: Who is the operative? <br>
KIRA: Intelligence told me that his name is Lasaran, but that's all
they'd say about him. They did emphasise several times that he's very
important to them and we should send someone to the Badlands as soon as
possible. So, with the Defiant gone and most of the runabouts off on
exercises with the Ninth Fleet <br>
DAX: We just volunteered to take a trip to the Badlands. <br>
KIRA: Afraid so. The Shenandoah is prepped and ready to go on landing
pad A. Good luck.

DAX: No. <br>
WORF: No? <br>
DAX: No. I'm not going to spend two weeks hiking across Vulcan's Forge
in the middle of their summer. <br>
WORF: I thought you always wanted to see the Forge. <br>
DAX: See it, yes. Honeymoon there, no. <br>
WORF: Well, there's a mountain climbing expedition on Andor that caught
my attention. <br>
DAX: Worf, my love. Let me make this very clear. I do not want to spend
my honeymoon climbing, hiking, sweating, bleeding or suffering in any
way. <br>
WORF: All right, what do you want? <br>
DAX: Room service. <br>
WORF: Room service? <br>
DAX: Room service. I want to be pampered. I want a staff to cater to
our every whim. I want to be embarrassed by the size of our room. I
want a balcony with a view that would make you want to break down and
cry from the sheer beauty of it all. And I don't want to spend one
moment of our honeymoon suffering from anything except guilt about our
complete self-indulgence. <br>
WORF: Risa. <br>
DAX: Not this time. Welcome to Casperia Prime. The vacation capital of
the Horvian Cluster. <br>
(The PADD says Starfleet Bureau of Information. It should be the
Hitchhiker's Guide, methinks.) <br>
WORF: You have been planning this all along. <br>
DAX: Seemed fair. You did plan the wedding. <br>
WORF: Very well. Room service. <br>
DAX: Really? <br>
WORF: Really. <br>
DAX: Well that was easy. <br>
WORF: Did you want to fight over it? <br>
DAX: No. It's just I didn't expect you to surrender so quickly. <br>
WORF: Surrender? <br>
DAX: Bad word. <br>
WORF: Very bad. <br>
DAX: Okay. But you have to admit you've been unusually accommodating
lately. <br>
WORF: What is wrong with that? <br>
DAX: Nothing. It's just unusual. Are you feeling all right? <br>
WORF: I'm a married man. I have to make certain adjustments to my
lifestyle. <br>
DAX: Adjustments? Worf, you're practically easygoing. What's next, a
sense of humour? <br>
WORF: I have a sense of humour. On the Enterprise, I was considered to
be quite amusing. <br>
DAX: That must've been one dull ship. <br>
WORF: That is a joke. I get it. It is not funny, but I get it. <br>
DAX: I don't know if I can get used to the new you. It's kind of eerie.
<br>
WORF: Your problem is you cannot accept change. <br>
DAX: I can't accept change? <br>
WORF: That is correct. <br>
DAX: Oh, you've got to be kidding. I've changed bodies six times, Worf.
<br>
WORF: Yes, but you are still very set in your ways. <br>
DAX: And look who's talking. <br>
WORF: Well, I do not have to sleep on the same side of the bed every
night, or brush my hair exactly fifty strokes every night, or eat the
same thing for breakfast every day, or read the last page of a book
before the beginning, or lift up the <br>

BASHIR: You play tongo? <br>
O'BRIEN: Sure. Well, I used to. That is, I played a game once, a long
time ago with a Ferengi privateer and a Romulan mercenary. <br>

LASARAN [on monitor]: Who are you? <br>
WORF: I am Commander Worf, this is Commander Dax. Starfleet
Intelligence has sent us here to receive your transmission. <br>
LASARAN [on monitor]: A Klingon. Why did they have to send a Klingon? <br>
DAX: I'm a Trill. Does that make you feel any better? <br>
LASARAN [on monitor]: Are you trying to be funny? <br>
DAX: Not at all. He's the funny one. <br>
WORF: What is it you want? <br>
LASARAN [on monitor]: We'll get to that in a moment. First, I have
something that you want badly. Information about the Founders. I know
how many of them there are in the Alpha Quadrant, where they are and
what they're doing. <br>
DAX: We're listening. <br>
LASARAN [on monitor]: I'm sure you are. Now let's talk about what I
want. I want out. Now. <br>
DAX: You want to defect. <br>
LASARAN: The Vorta advisor here is getting suspicious, asking
questions, making a lot of routine security checks in my section. I
can't stay here any longer. <br>
WORF: Very well. We will relay your message to Starfleet Intelligence
and they will arrange to bring you out. <br>
LASARAN [on monitor]: I can't wait for them to make arrangements. In
fifteen minutes I am leaving here for the Dominion base on Soukara, and
I have a feeling this is going to be the last time that they let me
leave Cardassia Prime, so I need to take advantage of this opportunity.
<br>
WORF: Soukara is inside Dominion controlled space. It will not be easy
to make a rendezvous near that planet without being detected. <br>
LASARAN [on monitor]: Don't work your brain too hard, Klingon, I've
taken care of everything. Three days from now, at exactly seventeen
thirty hours local time, I will leave the base and walk into the
jungle. It'll be at least two days before they know I'm missing. All
you have to do is get me off the planet. Now, there are transporter
scramblers protecting Soukara, so you can't beam me aboard your ship.
You're going to have to land and meet me at a rendezvous point on foot.
I'm sending you all the information you'll need to avoid the Dominion
sensors on the ground. Follow my instructions, meet me at the
rendezvous point and have a ship waiting. <br>
DAX: We've got the information. It looks pretty thorough. <br>
WORF: We will need time to study these plans. <br>
LASARAN [on monitor]: You haven't been listening. I don't have time.
Once I leave here, I can't contact you again. I have to know if you're
going to be there or not, and I have to know now. <br>
WORF: We will be there. <br>

of a Klingon. Three days. Don't be late.

BASHIR: Why are you so determined to beat him? <br>
O'BRIEN: It's the challenge. <br>
BASHIR: The challenge? <br>
O'BRIEN: Isn't it enough? Why do you think I became an engineer? The
challenge. What do you think has kept me kayaking down the same river
week after week for the last seven years? The challenge. Why would I
keep playing darts against someone with a genetically engineered
hand-eye coordination? <br>
BASHIR: The challenge. <br>
O'BRIEN: Exactly. I have to do something to keep my mind off the fact
that Keiko's been away for six months. Hold on. Maybe I can't beat
Quark, but you can. You and that genetically engineered brain of yours.

beat him. <br>

O'BRIEN: Yeah, well, you're good at calculation, but a little weak on
strategy. I'll be your coach. <br>

O'BRIEN: Think of it as a challenge. <br>
BASHIR: That's your obsession, Miles, not mine. <br>
O'BRIEN: Do it for the latinum. <br>
BASHIR: Nice try. <br>
O'BRIEN: Do it for the satisfaction of the look on Quark's face when
he's beaten at a game of tongo to a lowly human. <br>

three gaps and they're all in that asteroid field. <br>

the helm, I'll scan the surface for a landing site. <br>

DAX: There's the base, the rendezvous point, and the Dominion sensor
perimeter. There's a valley about twenty kilometres north of the
rendezvous point. It's a long way to go on foot in the jungle, but I
don't think we can risk taking the ship any closer to their sensors. <br>
WORF: Agreed. <br>

WORF: We have less than two days to reach the rendezvous point <br>
DAX: About ten kilometres a day. That shouldn't be too bad. <br>
WORF: Do not underestimate the task ahead. We still have to penetrate
the sensor grid and avoid the Dominion patrols. <br>

him out without getting caught. Piece of cake. <br>

They have yet to create the computer that can master this game. <br>

QUARK: You realise we're not playing for drinks. This is a high stakes

QUARK: I would never say something so distasteful during a game. <br>
BASHIR: You'd wait until it was over. <br>
QUARK: Of course. Evade. Dax was a quick study too. She told me it only
took her two weeks to win her first match. That's practically unheard
of. <br>
BASHIR: Dax specialises in the unexpected. Still buying at three
hundred, selling at four hundred. I'd like to index the margin at
twenty percent. <br>
QUARK: Interesting. She certainly did the unexpected when she married
Commander Boring. <br>
BASHIR: That's for sure. <br>
QUARK: When they first started seeing each other, I thought this can't
last. I give it two months. I'll buy at four hundred and sell at five. <br>

gave it a month. Confront. <br>
QUARK: She's a real heartbreaker, that one. <br>
BASHIR: That she is. <br>
QUARK: Leverage the buy in and sell at five fifty. You know, you go
through a lot of ups and downs in my business. There are days when the
profits are down and the customers are scarce and you think you'll
never see another strip of latinum again. And then Jadzia comes in and
flashes that smile of hers. Suddenly things don't seem so bad after
all. <br>

walks past the Infirmary and all she has to do is wink and somehow that
makes my whole day look a little brighter. <br>

QUARK: Out of reach. I'm converting my reserves and selling at six
hundred. You know what's really sad, what really keeps me awake at
night? She's out of reach because we let her go. <br>

O'BRIEN: Julian, are you sure you want to <br>
QUARK: Chief, please. You know the rules. No coaching during a round.
You're probably right. But what if that's a convenient rationalisation?
What if deep down in our heart of hearts we both know she's something
unique, something we may never see again. A chance at true happiness
and we let her slip through our fingers. What if fifty years from now
we each look back and say, what a fool I was. Confront. Doctor? <br>

BASHIR: You mean all that about Dax was meant to distract me? <br>
O'BRIEN: Obviously. <br>
BASHIR: I can't believe I let him get to me. <br>
O'BRIEN: Not your fault. Genetically engineered or not, you're still
human. <br>
BASHIR: I guess. <br>
O'BRIEN: Let's go get a drink.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Jungle]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Worf and Dax walk through the plants to the
accompaniment of animal sounds. The sun climbs high in the sky. Dax
uses a PADD compass. Worf uses his mek'leth as a machete. Worf treats
an injury on Dax's leg. Evening falls and the frogs call. They make
camp with birdsong in the trees. Full night, and Dax puts a foil
blanket around Worf's shoulders.) <br>
DAX: Let's not stand on pride, shall we? Trills don't like the heat,
and Klingons don't like the cold. There's no shame in admitting it. <br>
WORF: Thank you. <br>
DAX: You're welcome. So, how are you enjoying your honeymoon? Are you
suffering enough? <br>
WORF: Almost. <br>
DAX: Is there anything I can get for you? <br>
WORF: More pain, less cold. <br>
DAX: I don't know why that's funny, but it is. <br>
(Howl) <br>
DAX: Mating call? <br>
WORF: Five hundred metres that way. <br>
(Another howl.) <br>
DAX: That didn't take long. <br>
WORF: Less than three hundred metres. <br>
(Pair of howls.) <br>
DAX: Another happy couple. <br>
WORF: When I was a boy, my father used to take my brother and me on
camping trips in the Ural mountains. Every night we would listen to the
wolves howling in the distance. Nikolai was afraid of them, but I would
lay in my tent for hours just listening. I remember being seized by the
urge to just strip off my clothes and run into the night to live in the
forest and become something wild. <br>
DAX: He must have been rejected, he's moving away. She's not happy.
(twig break) What? They're getting farther away, aren't they? <br>
WORF: Yes, but it's because something is coming. And it is close. <br>
(They throw everything behind a fallen tree trunk and take cover. Three
Jem'Hadar enter the clearing. Dax shoots the first and Worf the second,
shots are exchanged then Worf throws his mek'leth to kill the third.) <br>
WORF: Jadzia? <br>
(Dax has been hit in the abdomen. She is whimpering in pain.) <br>
WORF: Lie still. <br>
DAX: I think I can do that. <br>
(Worf scans her.) <br>
DAX: Can I have the good news first? <br>
WORF: No vital organs were damaged. <br>
DAX: Now the bad news? <br>
WORF: The disruptor burst left an anti-coagulant in your system. <br>
DAX: So you can't stop the bleeding. <br>
WORF: No. <br>
DAX: Well, I must not have taken the whole burst. I'm not haemorrhaging
that bad yet. Just keep me pumped full of painkillers and let's be on
our way. <br>
WORF: Moving could make the bleeding worse. <br>
DAX: Staying here isn't an option. Someone's going to come looking for
them when they don't check in. I'd rather take my chances on foot. You
ready? You ready? <br>
WORF: Ready. <br>
DAX: Let's go. <br>
(Next day, Worf has been up a tree to get a better look around.) <br>
WORF: We are still twelve kilometres from the rendezvous point. <br>
DAX: And only twenty hours left. Well, I guess it's time we stop having
so much fun and pick up the pace, huh? Oh, more plasma? No, thanks. I'm
full. <br>
WORF: Your blood pressure has dropped another twenty percent. <br>
DAX: Love that bedside manner. You know, you should have been a doctor.
<br>
WORF: Your bandage will need to be changed soon. <br>
DAX: I think I'd like a blue chiffon bandage this time. Maybe some
rhinestones. Something with a little
pizzazz. <br>
WORF: This is no joking matter. You are seriously injured and we have a
great deal of terrain to cover. <br>
DAX: Just trying to lighten the mood. <br>
WORF: This is neither the time nor the place. <br>
DAX: What happened to that new Worf? You know, the one with the sense
of humour? <br>
WORF: That was a mistake. <br>
DAX: What is that supposed to mean? <br>
WORF: It means if I had not been joking with you, I would not have
allowed the Jem'Hadar to get so close. <br>
DAX: So this is all my fault. <br>
WORF: No. It is mine. I was trying to be something I am not. By letting
down my guard, by ignoring my duty, I allowed my wife to be injured and
I put the entire mission in jeopardy. It will not happen again. <br>
DAX: That's not what happened. Without our tricorders there's no way <br>
WORF: I do not wish to debate this. We have a long way to go and very
little time. <br>
DAX: Fine. Let's go. <br>
(More shots of them marching on, but Dax is starting to flag. She leans
against trees then shrugs off Worf's helping hand. They stop to rest
and he takes a sextant bearing.) <br>
WORF: Ready? <br>
(Near a waterfall they clamber over a fallen tree, and she collapses in
pain.) <br>
DAX: Hypo. There. Good as new. <br>
WORF: I have to change your dressing. <br>
DAX: That's four bandages in two hours. That's got to be some kind of
record. Oh, sorry. I forgot the new rules. Nothing funny. Got to be
serious. Life and death. We've got a job to do. <br>
WORF: Jadzia, I know you are tired, but we have to cover three
kilometres before nightfall. Can you do it? <br>
DAX: As long as you got those painkillers, I'll follow you through the
gates of hell, sir. That was almost a smile. <br>
WORF: When this mission is over, I will smile all you want. <br>
DAX: Oh, you promise? <br>
WORF: I promise. <br>
DAX: Then let's finish the mission and get out of here. Whoa. It's all
right, I can stand. Just help me get my balance. I got my balance.
Maybe not. <br>
(Another scan.) <br>
DAX: Let me guess. Things aren't looking up. <br>
WORF: There has been another drop in your blood pressure and your
neural EDL readings are erratic. <br>
DAX: So what's your prescription, Doc? <br>
WORF: Surgery. At a Starbase. <br>
DAX: Can I get a second opinion? Worf, you have to go on without me and
I know that. I understand. <br>
WORF: My duty requires that I complete the mission regardless of my
personal feelings. <br>
DAX: Absolutely. You're a Starfleet officer. So am I. I understand. <br>
WORF: The information Lasaran has could be potentially invaluable to
the war effort. <br>
DAX: You don't have to explain yourself. I'm hurt, you're not. And
there's a job to do. <br>
WORF: I will be back tomorrow night. <br>
DAX: Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere. <br>
WORF: I can have you in the stasis chamber on the runabout in forty
five hours. <br>
DAX: No problem. <br>
WORF: I will leave the medkit. Scan yourself with the tricorder every
half hour. The plasma hypospray will be set <br>
DAX: I took basic first aid. I know what I have to do. Worf, it's been
a great two months, hasn't it? <br>
WORF: Yes. Jadzia, I just want to tell you how <br>
DAX: Just kiss me and go. <br>
(Worf obeys, gives her a rifle and leaves her crying. He runs through
the jungle, his heartbeat pounding and drowning out the animal sounds
until he stops. As the Klingon heart beats, he looks forwards and back
then throws his mek'leth into a tree. Jadzia is
unconscious when he reaches her, so he carries her on his shoulders.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: What's the word? <br>
WORF: She is still in surgery, but Doctor Bashir is hopeful she will
make a full recovery. <br>
SISKO: Lasaran's dead. Starfleet Intelligence intercepted a
transmission saying that he'd been killed trying to re-enter the base
at Soukara. Could you have made the rendezvous? <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
SISKO: Yet you turned back to save Jadzia? <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
SISKO: Were you aware that the information that man had could have
saved millions of lives? <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
SISKO: So what happened? <br>
WORF: You may not understand. <br>
SISKO: Try me, sir. <br>
WORF: You were at my wedding. You heard the story of the first two
Klingon hearts and how nothing could stand against them, and how they
even destroyed the gods that created them. I have heard that story
since I was a boy but I never understood it, I mean really understood
it, until I was standing in the jungle with my heart pounding in my
chest and I found that even I could not stand against my own heart. I
had to go back and it did not matter what Starfleet thought or what the
consequences were. She was my wife and I could not leave her. <br>
SISKO: As your captain, it is my duty to tell you that you made the
wrong choice. I don't think Starfleet will file any formal charges.
Even a secret court martial would run the risk of revealing too much
about their intelligence operations. But this will go into your service
record, and to be completely honest, you probably won't be offered a
command on your own after this. <br>
WORF: I understand. <br>
SISKO: I have also issued new orders. You and Jadzia are not to be
assigned to a mission on your own ever again. And one last thing. As a
man who had a wife, if Jennifer had been lying in that clearing I
wouldn't have left her either.

DAX: Hey, I know you. <br>
WORF: We have met. <br>
DAX: Ah, you're joking again. That's a good sign. Did you make the
rendezvous? <br>
WORF: No. I could not leave you there. Not for Lasaran, not for the
mission, not for anything else. <br>
DAX: Lasaran? <br>
WORF: Dead. <br>
DAX: Are you in trouble? <br>
WORF: I have been in trouble before. <br>
DAX: I'm sorry. I should've kept going. <br>
WORF: You have nothing to be sorry about. <br>
DAX: I know how much your career means to you. <br>
WORF: You come first. Before career, before duty, before anything. I do
not regret what I did. And I would do it again. <br>
DAX: I don't know what to say. <br>
WORF: You could say, thank you for saving my life. <br>
DAX: Thank you for saving my life. <br>
WORF: And you could say, I would do the same for you, Worf. <br>
DAX: Well, I'd have to think about that. My career is very important to
me, you know. <br>
WORF: And you could say I love you. <br>
DAX: I love you. <br>
WORF: And I love you. </font> </p>
