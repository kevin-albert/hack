PICARD: Lieutenant, please receive our guest. <br>
WORF: Captain, I must request permission to send another officer. <br>
PICARD: May I know your reason? <br>
WORF: My dishonour among Klingons may offend Ambassador K'Ehleyr. <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant, you are a member of this crew, and you will not go
into hiding whenever a Klingon ship uncloaks. <br>

WORF: You may not respect our traditions, but I do. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">K'EHLEYR: The Klingon Empire is at a critical
juncture. We may be facing civil war. <br>
RIKER: War over what? <br>
K'EHLEYR: The usual excuses. Tradition, duty, honour. <br>
DATA: The word excuses implies ulterior motives for a conflict. <br>
K'EHLEYR: I won't bore you with the intricacies of Klingon politics.
Basically, two factions are trying to seize power. <br>
PICARD: Do you believe there is a threat to the Federation in this
struggle? <br>
K'EHLEYR: Klingon wars seldom remain confined to the Empire. Sooner or
later they'll drag in the neighbouring star systems, then the Tholians,
the Ferengi. The Federation won't be able to stay out of it for long.
This has been coming for some time. Only K'mpec, the head of the
Council, has been able to maintain the peace. <br>
TROI: Now something has changed that. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Correct. K'mpec is dying. He is aboard the cruiser. He has
come specifically to meet with you, Captain. Alone.

a lot of red in the decor, and the chairs are massive) <br>
K'MPEC: It's about time you arrived, Picard. Sit. <br>
(He dismisses the guard with a wave of his hand) <br>
K'MPEC: I need your help. <br>
PICARD: If the Enterprise medical facility can do anything to help. <br>
K'MPEC: Too late. For some months I have been poisoned with small doses
of Veridium six. The wine. There is no cure. <br>
PICARD: What do you want of me? <br>
K'MPEC: After I die, you will act in my name to arbitrate the struggle
for power. <br>
PICARD: I will? <br>
K'MPEC: No one on the Council can be trusted, and I have my reasons for
wanting an outsider. <br>
PICARD: K'mpec, you cannot possibly be serious. A Federation officer
has no business in <br>
K'MPEC: Nonsense. You are an accomplished mediator. This is no
different than any other dispute requiring your services. <br>
PICARD: On the contrary, I think this is very different. And I must
respectfully decline. <br>
K'MPEC: If you refuse the dying request of the Klingon Supreme
Commander it will be a insult by the Federation to all Klingons.
Besides, I've already sent the order to the leaders of the two opposing
factions. They're on their way. <br>
PICARD: You had no right to involve me without my permission. <br>
K'MPEC: If I'd asked, you would have said no. <br>
PICARD: This is not a case of simple mediation. You are asking me to
choose the next leader of the Klingon Empire. <br>
K'MPEC: No. By tradition, the two strongest challengers fight for the
right of succession. As mediator, only you can designate those
challengers. <br>
PICARD: But you have just said there are only two challengers arriving.
What is the point? <br>
K'MPEC: I want you to discover which one of them has killed me. Gowron
or Duras. Yes, Duras. I thought you would find that interesting. <br>
PICARD: Interesting? You could say that, since he tried to have me
killed, and conspired to strip Worf of his good name. <br>
K'MPEC: And I approved. All for the glory of the Empire. That should be
my epitaph. Find the assassin. The Klingon who kills without showing
his face has no honour. He must not lead the Empire. Such a man would
be capable of anything. Even war with the Federation. <br>
PICARD: Very well. I accept. <br>

K'EHLEYR: He is also my son and I am half-human. He will find his own
ways. Why the sudden concern? You won't even acknowledge that he's
yours. <br>
WORF: Why did you not tell me? <br>
K'EHLEYR: What would you have done? That's right. You would have
insisted that we take the oath, just as tradition would demand. <br>
WORF: You should not have kept this from me. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Well, now you know. <br>
WORF: I cannot acknowledge my relationship to the boy. It would only
harm him. <br>
K'EHLEYR: Because you were dishonoured? <br>
WORF: As my son, he would also bear my disgrace, as would his children.
<br>
K'EHLEYR: Why did you accept discommendation from the High Council? <br>
WORF: My father was accused of collaborating with the Romulans at
Khitomer. <br>
K'EHLEYR: I know. And I also know that you challenged it. <br>
WORF: Yes at first. Ultimately I withdrew my challenge. <br>
K'EHLEYR: But why, Worf? I can't believe you'd just give up. What
really happened? <br>

WORF: Duras must not be allowed to lead the council. <br>
PICARD: He has a legal claim, Mister Worf. Your personal feelings
toward him <br>
WORF: It is not personal, sir. His father betrayed my people to the
Romulans. Duras is a traitor. <br>
PICARD: Klingon tradition may hold the son responsible for his father's
sin. I cannot, Worf. Treason was his father's crime. Duras' crime was
to lay that blame on your father. I will not forget that. But you
should not forget that you chose to accept the consequences of that
lie. <br>
WORF: To preserve the Empire. <br>
PICARD: The issue now is whether or not he killed K'mpec. <br>
WORF: Sir? <br>
PICARD: He was murdered. Poisoned. <br>
WORF: A Klingon would not use poison. His murder would have no honour. <br>
PICARD: K'mpec believed that it was either Duras or Gowron. <br>

has often challenged the Council. But Duras? I know him. His heart is

just because of tradition. <br>

that two challengers have been chosen is necessary. <br>
PICARD: You said modern rite. How was the ritual performed in the past?
<br>
K'EHLEYR: The old forms dictated that the challengers perform the
ja'chuq. It's a long, involved ceremony where the challengers list the
battles they've won, the prizes they've taken, the idea being to prove
their worthiness to lead the Council. <br>

GOWRON: He has no place here, Picard! <br>
DURAS: I will not sit at the same table with that! <br>
PICARD: It is my prerogative to investigate anything that may be
relevant to the Rite of Succession. Lieutenant Worf is my Chief
Security Officer. His presence is required. <br>
DURAS: We will not proceed. <br>
PICARD: If you wish to withdraw from the ja'chuq, that is your option.
Proceed, Mister Worf. <br>
WORF: What did your investigations reveal about the explosion? <br>
DURAS: It was a bomb. <br>
WORF: And was your analysis just as insightful? <br>
GOWRON: It was a common explosive. <br>
WORF: What type? <br>
GOWRON: Triceron. <br>
WORF: What about the detonator? <br>
DURAS: This is pointless! The findings were inconclusive. <br>
WORF: Fortunately, our investigation was more thorough. The bomb used a
molecular-decay detonator. <br>
GOWRON: What? <br>
PICARD: A Romulan device. <br>
DURAS: I will return to my ship to confirm these conclusions myself. <br>
GOWRON: As will I. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, please be sure to send a complete record of our
findings to both vessels and to the High Council. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: That will be all.

K'EHLEYR: I've been investigating what happened at Khitomer. Not at all
an easy task, considering that most of the records are sealed. <br>
DURAS: Worf's father was a traitor. <br>
K'EHLEYR: No, the evidence was altered to make it appear that way. I
found it interesting to read that your father was also at Khitomer and
you are the one who sealed the records. <br>
DURAS: You would dare to insult my father's name? <br>
K'EHLEYR: Don't play the wounded Klingon for me, Duras. You don't do it
very well. What happened in that Council Chamber? How did you get Worf
to take the blame for you? <br>
DURAS: Do not pursue this matter further. <br>
K'EHLEYR: The son betrays his people to the Romulans just as his father
did, Duras?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: One of the Klingons who died in the
explosion was with Duras, the other was with Gowron. I've been
examining the bodies, trying to get a clue to where the bomb was
hidden. There's always a pattern in the lacerations and tissue damage.
It would normally give a clear indication as to the direction,
distance, force of impact. <br>
RIKER: Normally? <br>
CRUSHER: In this case, the pattern was virtually impossible to detect.
I couldn't understand it until I looked at the dynoscans. This wound is
different from all of the others. It was made from the inside out. The
bomb was implanted in one of their forearms. <br>
RIKER: It's considered an honourable way for a Klingon to die, a
suicide that takes an enemy with it. Which one of them was it? <br>
CRUSHER: Duras' man.
