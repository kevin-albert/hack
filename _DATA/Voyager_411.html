Cold, patronising, arrogant. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I know she can be difficult. <br>
TORRES: Difficult? She's impossible. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm getting tired of playing referee every time you two have
a disagreement. If you have a problem, talk to her yourself. <br>
TORRES: Does the word irrelevant mean anything to you? She won't
listen. She may look human, and she may sound human, but she's all
Borg. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Part of the problem is your attitude. You've never tried to
accept Seven as part of the crew. <br>
TORRES: And with good reason. Guess what she did this morning. She took
an isolinear processor out of Engineering without asking, and when I
went to Astrometrics to get it back she had locked the door, like that
lab is her own private domain. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What do you want me to do? Throw her in the brig for the rest
of the trip home? <br>
TORRES: I've heard worse ideas.<br>
SEVEN [OC]: Seven of Nine to Chakotay. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay here. <br>
SEVEN [OC]: Report to the Astrometrics lab at once.<br>
CHAKOTAY: On my way. <br>
TORRES: Did you hear that? She's giving orders now. I'm telling you,
Chakotay. If she gets in my way again, I am not responsible for what
happens.<br>
CHAKOTAY: You're a senior officer on this ship. Act like one. Find a
way to deal with her. <br>(Chakotay catches up with Janeway.)<br>CHAKOTAY: Astrometrics? <br>
JANEWAY: I've been summoned. Any guesses what this is about? <br>
CHAKOTAY: None. </font></p>

CHAKOTAY: Your call sounded urgent. <br>
SEVEN: It was. I've been working to increase the range of the
astrometric sensors, and I have detected something that you should find
of particular interest.<br>
JANEWAY: A ship. What's special about it? <br>
SEVEN: I've analysed the warp signature. It's a Starfleet vessel. The
ship we're seeing is in the Alpha Quadrant. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You couldn't have extended the astrometric sensors that far. <br>
SEVEN: No, but I increased the range far enough to detect a large
network of relay stations. They're alien in origin, abandoned but still
functioning. By establishing a sensor link with the nearest station I'm
getting readings from the entire network. The Starfleet ship is within
range of one of the farthest sensors near the outer edges of the Alpha Quadrant.<br>
JANEWAY: It must be on a deep space mission. <br>
SEVEN: I've extrapolated it's course. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It doesn't look like we'll be able to keep track of it very
long. <br>
SEVEN: The ship should move out of range in forty one minutes. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Can we use the network to transmit a message? <br>
SEVEN: Yes, but we'll have to remodulate our signal to match the
network's interlink frequency. <br>
JANEWAY: We don't have much time. Get it done, Chakotay.<br>(Chakotay leaves. Later, as Voyager hangs still in space -) <br>SEVEN:
Seven of Nine to Ensign Kim. <br>
KIM [OC]: Kim here. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
Got it. <br>
JANEWAY: Seven, how much longer do we have? <br>
SEVEN [OC]: Sixteen minutes. <br>
TORRES: That should do it. The subspace transceiver is at two hundred
percent output and online. We're ready. <br>
JANEWAY: Open a channel. <br>
KIM: Open. <br>
JANEWAY: Starfleet vessel, this is Captain Kathryn Janeway of the
starship Voyager. We are in the Delta Quadrant, at coordinates one
eight, mark two oh five, mark four seven. Remodulate your signal to
match our interlink frequency. <br>
TUVOK: We're receiving a transmission. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's hear it. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Astrometrics

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> SEVEN:
I don't understand. My readings show that the station picked up our
message and relayed it across the entire network. </font></p>

Can we try a different kind of signal? Something stronger?<br>
TORRES: A holographic datastream might work. It wouldn't degrade so
quickly. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It would take too long to reconfigure the message, unless <br>
JANEWAY: The Doctor. <br>
TORRES: Exactly. <br>

Doctor, you have to come with me, quickly. <br>

When I requested more away missions, this isn't exactly what I had in
mind. <br>
JANEWAY: You may be our only chance to communicate with that ship. <br>
TORRES: When you get there, you'll be downloaded into their EMH system.
I'm sending an initiation code along with your programme so you'll be
activated immediately.<br>
SEVEN: We have less than ninety seconds before that ship moves out of
range. <br>
EMH: How am I supposed to get back here? <br>
JANEWAY: When you've completed your mission, instruct them to move
within range of the sensor network. With any luck, they can send you back
the same way you came. <br>
EMH: Luck?<br>
JANEWAY: I won't lie to you, doctor. A lot of things could go wrong.
We're relying on an alien technology to send you across thousands of
light years.<br>
EMH: So there's a chance my programme could be lost. <br>
JANEWAY: Yes. I'm asking you to take that chance. <br>
SEVEN: Thirty five seconds. <br>JANEWAY: Doctor?<br>
EMH: Far be it from me to turn down an opportunity to become a hero.
I'm ready. <br>

COMPUTER: Affirmative. <br>
EMH: Ah. Sickbay to bridge. <br>(No answer.)<br>EMH: All right. this is Sickbay calling any crew
member. Please respond. Computer, is the comm. system malfunctioning?<br>
COMPUTER: Negative. <br>
EMH: Then why can't I reach anyone?<br>
COMPUTER: Access to the communications system has been restricted. <br>
EMH: Restricted? But this is important. Isn't there some sort of
emergency comm. channel available? <br>(He
sees a scorch mark on the wall, then a burnt woman lying on the deck.
She is dead, but not the man nearby. The EMH gives him a hypo.)<br>EMH: Try to lie still. You have severe

Commander, there's a vessel approaching on an intercept course. It's

NEVALA: I've been trying. These new systems are unfamiliar. We should
have left some of the crew alive. <br>
REKAR: You'd be surprised how stubborn humans can be. <br>

EMH: Computer, display the design schematic of this ship and list
general specifications. <br>

deep space tactical assignments. Primary battle systems include
regenerative shielding, ablative hull armour, multivector assault

COMPUTER: Negative. Communications access requires level four clearance
or above. <br>(The doors open and the EMH ducks down behind the console. Nevala enters with the injured Romulan and he stands up again.)<br>
EMH: Please state the nature of the medical emergency. <br>
NEVALA: Who activated you?<br>
EMH: You did, automatically, when you entered Sickbay. <br>
NEVALA: Can you treat him? <br>
EMH: Of course, that's my function. Third degree burns, hairline jaw
fracture, and a ruptured blood vessel in his brain. I'll have to
operate.<br>
NEVALA: You're a Starfleet programme. Why should I trust you?<br>
EMH: I'm a doctor. Whether my patient is human, or Romulan, I'll do
everything in my power to save him. You're welcome to assist me if you
like. Or maybe you'd just prefer to supervise. (The EMH brings a tray of instruments and makes a start.)<br>
NEVALA: Report to me when you're finished. <br>
EMH: Mmm hmm. <br>(Nevala leaves. The EMH leaves his patient.)<br>EMH: Computer, can I access this ship's EMH programme or do I need some
kind of clearance for that, too? <br>
COMPUTER: Access to that programme is unrestricted.<br>
EMH: Activate it. <br>(The Prometheus' EMH appears. He is younger and with a full head of hair.)<br>EMH2: Please state the nature of the medical emergency. What the hell
are you doing in my Sickbay? I've been programmed to identify every
member of this crew. You aren't one of them.<br>
EMH: That's because I'm<br>
EMH2: State your rank and security clearance. <br>
EMH: I don't have clearance. I'm an Emergency Medical Hologram. I've
been sent here to <br>

programme. <br>
EMH: Inferior?<br>
EMH2: Beady eyes, terrible bedside manner. I recognise you. But you're
not part of this database. What are you doing here? <br>
EMH: If you'd disengage your vocal subroutines for one second, I'd
explain. I was transmitted onto this ship by a Starfleet vessel over
sixty thousand light years from here. <br>
EMH2: Sixty thousand light years? We don't have ships that far out. <br>
EMH: It's the starship Voyager. We were taken into the Delta Quadrant
four years ago by an alien force. What are you doing? <br>
EMH2: Activating intruder alert. <br>
EMH: That's the last thing you want to do. <br>
EMH2: Security. <br>(The EMH puts his hand over his colleague's mouth.) <br>
EMH: Listen to me. This vessel has been taken over by Romulans. The
crew is dead. You and I are the only Starfleet officers on board. Do
you understand?&nbsp;<br>
EMH2: (muffled) I understand. <br>(The EMH removes his hand.)<br>EMH2: Computer, deactivate EMH. <br>
EMH: Computer, activate EMH. <br>
EMH2: Please state the nature of the medical emergency. Now what?<br>
EMH: I need your help. <br>
EMH2: Starfleet security protocol twenty eight subsection D. In the
event of hostile alien takeover, the EMH is to deactivate and wait for
rescue.<br>
EMH: I'm afraid you don't have that luxury. There are two ships at
stake here, yours and mine. Now, I need to know more about what's
happening. Is the Federation at war with the Romulans? <br>
EMH2: No. The Romulans haven't gotten involved in our fight with the
Dominion. <br>
EMH: The who?<br>
EMH2: Long story.<br>
EMH: In any case, we need to take control of this situation. <br>
EMH2: I'm a doctor, not a commando.<br>
EMH: It's time you became a little of both. <br>
EMH2: You don't understand. The Prometheus is an experimental
prototype, and so am I. I, I, I haven't even been field tested yet. I'm
not designed for this kind of duty.<br>
EMH: Try to calm down. You'll do fine as long as I'm here. I have
plenty of expertise in this area. Now, first things first. We've got a
patient. You treat his burns, I'll repair the bone fracture. <br>
EMH2: You're not serious. <br>
EMH: I certainly am. <br>
EMH2: He's the enemy. <br>
EMH: He needs our help. I assume you're familiar with the Hippocratic Oath?<br>
EMH2: You see? You see what's happening? The Romulans are using you. <br>
EMH: Hmm. <br>
EMH2: Hmm what? <br>
EMH: Your holomatrix is unstable. It may explain your erratic
behaviour. <br>
EMH2: I told you, I'm a work in progress! I was only installed six
weeks ago. <br>
EMH: Stable or not, I need you. And so does he. <br>
EMH2: He'll live. I say we leave him and deactivate ourselves. <br>
EMH: No! You're free to do as you please. Go cower inside the data
processor if you'd like. I'll work alone. <br>
EMH2: We're medical holograms. What can we expect to do against a ship
full of Romulans? <br>
EMH: I'm not sure. Not yet. But I've faced my share of challenges.
Alien invasions, macro-viral infestations. I've crossed Borg space,
travelled through time.<br>
EMH2: Have you run a self-diagnostic lately? The EMH mark one is
designed to function in Sickbay only.<br>
EMH: Voyager lost it's Chief Medical Officer four years ago. I've been
active ever since. <br>
EMH2: Four years? No wonder you're delusional. Your programme's degrading
after being active for so long. <br>
EMH: I assure you I am in perfect health. I was saving Voyager from
annihilation when you were only a gleam in your programmer's eye. Now,
are you going to help me take back this ship or not? <br>
EMH2: Get me the thrombic modulator. <br>(The EMH hesitates over the various devices on the instrument tray, then picks up one like a small flying saucer.)<br>EMH2:&nbsp;It's the cone shaped device. Hand
it to me, please. Medical science has made a few advances while you've
been off in the Delta Quadrant, did you say? <br>
EMH: That's right. <br>
EMH2: We don't use scalpels or leeches anymore. I suggest you let me
handle the medical side of things. As for retaking the ship, I'll leave
that in your experienced hands. </font></p>

is standing watch in Astrometrics. I tried to relieve her but she
doesn't want to leave her post. She says she doesn't need to regenerate

JANEWAY: Letters home. I started them a year ago. One to my family, one
to Mark. I'm making a few updates, just in case. I know. It's premature.
<br>
CHAKOTAY: You're right. It's probably a mistake for us to get our hopes
up at all. We've been through this before. All right, I'll admit it. I

I've accessed the navigational logs. We're at warp nine point nine,
heading straight for Romulan space. <br>

somehow. What kind of anaesthetics do you have handy? <br>
EMH2: Only the best. Axonol, neurozine, anaesthazine. <br>
EMH: Neurozine will do nicely. It can be distributed in gaseous form.
Show me a schematic of the ship's ventilation system. Please. <br>

environmental control. <br>
EMH: It looks like there are holo-emitters on every deck. <br>

free reign on Voyager, and I can even leave the ship as well. <br>

EMH: My mobile emitter. A little piece of twenty ninth century
technology we obtained. <br>
EMH2: Really? <br>
EMH: I'm as close to a sentient life form as any hologram could hope to

Starfleet years to develop the EMH. I can't just design a new doctor. <br>

Lieutenant Torres. You are recalibrating the relay interface. <br>
TORRES: That's right. <br>
SEVEN: State your reasons for making these modifications. <br>
TORRES: State your reasons, please. It's not what you say, Seven. It's
how you say it. <br>
SEVEN: I don't understand. <br>
TORRES: You may have noticed that some of the crew seem a bit on edge
when you're around. <br>
SEVEN: I was Borg. I elicit apprehension. <br>
TORRES: No, that's not what I mean. We're not afraid that you're going
to assimilate us. We're just not used to. You just. You're rude. <br>
SEVEN: I am rude? <br>
TORRES: Yes. Yes. You order people around, you do things without
permission, and whether you realise it or not you come off as a little
insulting. You don't even say please or thank you. Look, I don't expect
you to change overnight but, try to remember that we are not just a
bunch of drones.<br>
SEVEN: Your attempt to recalibrate the interface is ill-advised. The
risk of disrupting our link is too great. <br>
TORRES: In your opinion. That is exactly what I'm talking
about. You haven't even been listening to me. I don't know why I try to
talk to you if you don't even. Are we losing the link?<br>

What else have you done to this ship? I will deactivate you unless you
start answering my questions. <br>
EMH: If I answer them, you'll very likely deactivate me anyway, so I
fail to see the point. <br>
REKAR: You are nothing but a computer generated projection. I find it
hard to believe you're capable of taking these actions independently. <br>
EMH: How flattering. <br>
REKAR: Tell me, who is operating your programme? Is it someone on this
ship? A Starfleet crew member we missed, or one of my own men? <br>
EMH: Paranoia is a way of life for you, isn't it? <br>(Nevala enters.)<br>
NEVALA: The computer log shows the ship received an optronic datastream
transmission approximately six hours ago. It contained a holographic
subroutine. <br>
REKAR: Who sent it? <br>
NEVALA: Unknown. The data pattern had a Starfleet signature. <br>
REKAR: So, Starfleet has managed to sneak a holographic operative
aboard. Very clever. <br>
NEVALA: Were you only sent to spy on us, or does your mission include
sabotage? <br>
EMH: The datastream you detected came from an alien sensor network. It
transferred me from a Starfleet ship in the Delta Quadrant. <br>
NEVALA: The Delta Quadrant? That's absurd. <br>
REKAR: This is pointless. <br>
EMH: I couldn't agree more. <br>
NEVALA: Maybe there's a better way to retrieve information from a
hologram. I suggest a complete algorithm extraction. We can analyse his
subroutines one by one.<br>
REKAR: Proceed. <br>
EMH: Isn't there some kind of convention regarding the treatment of
prisoners? <br>(Gas pours out of the ventilation system. Rekar and Nevala gasp, then collapse. EMH2 appears.)<br>
EMH2: Did it work? (to Nevala.) Sorry to interrupt. <br>
EMH: Did you anaesthetise the entire ship? <br>
EMH2: I did. I did.<br>
EMH: How did you manage to release the neurozine? I never opened the
ventilation system. <br>
EMH2: Trapped in the Jefferies tube, alone, nowhere to run, his smug
comrade captured by Romulans, EMH mark two had to improvise.
Inspiration. He accessed the main computer and simulated a ship wide
biohazard, making the computer think there was a microbiotic
contamination on all decks. <br>
EMH: And the ventilation system opened automatically. <br>
EMH2: Presto. He then crawled back out of the tube, accessed the
holoemitters, transferred here, excused the Romulan, saw the
dumbfounded look on his comrade's face <br>
EMH: The end. You know, you really should keep a personal log. Why bore
others needlessly? We have to get to the bridge. This ship needs a crew,
and we're it. <br>
EMH2: Oh, trouble. The Prometheus is a prototype. Top secret. Only four
people in all of Starfleet trained to operate it. I hope your myriad
adventures included piloting lessons <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The EMH2 transfers them both to the bridge.)<br>EMH2: Because there's nothing in my programme that will help us fly
this thing. <br>
EMH: I've had my share of piloting experience. Actually, only two
lessons, and they were in a shuttlecraft on the holodeck. But I showed
great intuition. Where's the helm?<br>
EMH2: You'd better intuit it fast. We're only about eight minutes from
the Romulan border. <br>
EMH: Ah, there it is. <br>(He pushes the sleeping Romulan onto the deck and sits in his seat. EMH2 looks over his shoulder.)<br>
EMH2: This is all very complicated. <br>
EMH: Stop breathing down my neck. <br>
EMH2: My breathing is merely a simulation. <br>
EMH: So is my neck. Stop it anyway. <br>
EMH2: Is this a thruster control? <br>
EMH: Don't touch that, we don't know what it does. It could be the
self-destruct. <br>
EMH2: You look worried. <br>
EMH: I'm just concentrating.<br>
EMH2: You don't know what you're doing, do you. This is not a shuttle
and we are not on a holodeck. <br>
EMH: Shush. <br>
EMH2: Mister I can leave my ship. The Voice of Experience.<br>
EMH: Let me think. Ah, here it is. This looks like the nacelle power
control. <br>
EMH2: So? So? <br>
EMH: There's a little trick I saw Mister Paris do once. If I can
generate a slight overload to the nacelle coils, it'll collapse the warp
field. <br>(Whumph!)<br>
EMH2: What happened? <br>
EMH: I did it. We've stopped. Ah, All we have to do now is find a way
to send Starfleet a distress signal and <br>(The console beeps.)<br>
EMH2: Beep beep beep? Beep beep beep? I've never heard that one before. <br>
EMH: Oh, no. <br>
EMH2: What? <br>
EMH: I'm not sure, but I think whatever I did initiated a warp core
overload. <br>
EMH2: You mean the ship's going to explode? You've got to stop it.<br>(The EMH touches controls and the beeping stops.) <br>
EMH: No problem. <br>(A new set of beeps starts up.)<br>
EMH2: What now? <br>

KIM: I'm telling you, this probably isn't going to work. <br>
PARIS: What happened to all that youthful optimism? <br>
KIM: Being a doctor is a lot more than knowing facts. We still have to
create analytical subroutines to help him diagnose patients, tactile
protocols so he can perform surgery, not to mention a personality
