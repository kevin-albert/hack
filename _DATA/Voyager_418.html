		and an additional seventeen minutes for Ensign Kim's usual 
		conversational digressions. I am scheduled to take a nutritional 
		supplement at fifteen hundred hours, engage in one hour of 
		cardiovascular activity, then I intend to review a text the Doctor

		Information will be provided on a need-to-know basis. Captain's orders. <br>
		TORRES:  Classified? By who? We're sixty thousand light years from Starfleet. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Like I said. Need to know. B'Elanna, she wants you to install multiphasic
		shielding around the warp core.  <br>
		TORRES: I've never seen this shield configuration. I'd like to run a couple of 
		computer simulations to make sure it's stable. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: No time. She needs this done by eleven hundred hours. <br>
		TORRES: Eleven hundred? I don't think that's possible. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Make it possible. <br>
		SEVEN: Are we attempting to protect the core from some form of subspace radiation? <br>
		CHAKOTAY: I don't know any more than you do. <br>
		SEVEN: It will be difficult to complete the task without more data. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: The data you've got will have to do. Tom, start modifying a 
		shuttlecraft to withstand extreme thermal stress. Twelve thousand Kelvins, at least. <br>
		PARIS: Aye, sir. <br>
		TORRES: Does all this have anything to do with that secret message the Captain received? <br>
		CHAKOTAY: What have you heard? <br>
		TORRES: Rumours, mainly. Janeway's been locked in her ready room for the 
		past sixteen hours. Something about an Omega Directive.  <br>
		SEVEN: Omega? <br>
		PARIS: Ring a bell? <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Look, the speculation ends right here. Now, I expect you to 
		carry out your assignments with a minimum of gossip, understood? 
		I know it's hard not to wonder. Frankly, I'm curious myself, but 
		the captain was very adamant about this. Get going. (to Seven) The captain wants to see you. <br>

<font face="Arial" size="2">		JANEWAY: Come in. What do you know about the Omega Directive? <br>
		SEVEN: Everything you do, most likely. <br>
		JANEWAY: I thought as much. The Borg assimilated Starfleet captains. 
		You would possess all of their knowledge. <br>
		SEVEN: That's correct. Do you intend to carry out the Directive? <br>
		JANEWAY: Yes. <br>
		SEVEN: Then sensors have detected the molecule. <br>
		JANEWAY: So it would appear. But we have to confirm it. <br>
		SEVEN: We? <br>
		JANEWAY: You're going to help me carry out the Directive. Protocol 
		forbids me from discussing this mission with any of my crew, but 
		since you already know about it, my choice is to either work with 
		you or confine you to quarters. <br>
		SEVEN: Perhaps you should do the latter. I will not help you destroy Omega. It should be harnessed. <br>
		JANEWAY: That's impossible. <br>
		SEVEN: The Borg believe otherwise. <br>
		JANEWAY: Explain. <br>
		SEVEN: On one occasion, we were able to create a single Omega molecule. We kept it 
		stable for one trillionth of a nanosecond before it destabilised. We didn't 
		have enough boronite ore left to synthesise more, but the knowledge we gained allowed us to 
		refine our theories. <br>
		JANEWAY: The Borg have been waiting for the chance to test them out. <br>
		SEVEN: Yes. But we never found another source of the ore. Until now. <br>
		JANEWAY: Sorry, but if someone out there is experimenting with Omega, I'm under 
		orders to stop them. Otherwise, this entire quadrant would be at risk. <br>
		SEVEN: Those orders were issued as a result of Starfleet's ignorance and fear. 
		I can alleviate your ignorance. As for your fear<br>
		JANEWAY: Sometimes fear should be respected, Seven. Tell me, how many Borg were sacrificed during this experiment? <br>
		SEVEN: Twenty nine vessels, six hundred thousand drones. But that is irrelevant. <br>
		JANEWAY: Not to me, not to my crew, and not to the people who live in this 
		quadrant. I'm going to neutralise this threat, Seven, with or without your help. <br>
		SEVEN: I will assist you. <br>
		JANEWAY: You will? <br>
		SEVEN: I have waited many years to observe this molecule firsthand. 
		I will not deny myself this experience. <br>
		JANEWAY: All right. Go back to your cargo bay, assemble all the data you have about 
		Omega. I'll expect a report within the hour. I didn't realise you had such a strong scientific curiosity. <br>
		SEVEN: Not curiosity. Desire. <br>
		JANEWAY: Desire? <br>
		SEVEN: Omega is infinitely complex, yet harmonious. 
		To the Borg it represents perfection. I wish to understand that perfection. <br>
		JANEWAY: The Borg's Holy Grail. <br>
		SEVEN: Captain? <br>
		JANEWAY: Never mind. I'll see you in an hour.

		EMH: What are you planning to do, stroll through a supernova? <br>
		JANEWAY: Something like that. Twenty milligrams. When can you have it ready? <br>
		EMH: Captain, arithrazine is used for the most severe cases of theta radiation 
		poisoning. A physician must be present to monitor the treatment. <br>
		JANEWAY: That won't be possible. <br>
		EMH: Then I'm afraid I can't accommodate you. I'd be in violation of

planning on detonating it and opening up a wormhole to the Alpha

our hopes up, she's not telling anybody. <br>

<font face="Arial" size="2">		JANEWAY: Come in. Status report? <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Everything's going according to schedule. <br>
		JANEWAY: Good. The Omega Directive doesn't allow me to say much but I want 
		you to know what to expect. At oh six hundred hours, I'll be leaving in a shuttle with Seven of Nine. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: Would it be out of line to ask where you're going? <br>
		JANEWAY: I can tell you this. One of two things is going to happen. 
		Either Seven and I will succeed on our mission, and return within a few 
		days, or your long range sensors will detect a large explosion in subspace. 
		If that occurs, you'll have less than ten seconds to jump to warp 
		and get the hell out of here. Head for the Alpha Quadrant and don't look back, understood? <br>
		CHAKOTAY: I always thought Starfleet was run by duty-crazed bureaucrats, but 
		I find it hard to believe that even they would order a captain to go on a suicide 
		mission. This shuttle excursion is your idea, isn't it? <br>
		JANEWAY: Let's just say I've had to amend the Directive, given the circumstances, 
		But you have your orders and I expect you to follow them. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: That's expecting a lot. You're asking me to abandon my captain and closest 
		friend without even telling me why.  <br>
		JANEWAY: If it were a simple matter of trust I wouldn't hesitate to tell you, but we've 
		encountered situations where information was taken from us by force. I can't allow 
		knowledge of Omega to go beyond Voyager. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: That's a reasonable argument, but you're not always a reasonable woman. 
		You're determined to protect this crew, and this time you've taken it too far. 
		A dangerous mission? Fine, I'll acknowledge that, but isn't it more likely to 
		succeed with everyone behind you, working together? <br>
		JANEWAY: Ordinarily, I'd agree. But this Directive was issued many years ago, 
		and Starfleet didn't exactly have our predicament in mind. Lost in the Delta 
		Quadrant, with no backup. I can't ignore the orders, but I won't ask the crew to risk 
		their lives because of my obligation. <br>
		CHAKOTAY: My obligation. That's where you're wrong. Voyager may be alone out here, 
		but you're not. Let us help you. We'll keep classified information limited to the 
		senior staff. We'll take every security precaution. Just don't try to do this alone. <br>
		JANEWAY: Assemble the troops.

<font face="Arial" size="2">		<b>[Briefing room]</b>
		 </font></p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">		JANEWAY: If we were in the Alpha Quadrant right now, we wouldn't be having 
		this conversation. I'd be in contact with Starfleet 
		Command, and they'd send in a specialised team to deal with the crisis. 
		In their absence, we're going to have to make do with the training I've received, 
		and the knowledge Seven of Nine has retained from the Borg. You've all 
		seen this symbol. Omega, the last letter of the Greek alphabet. 
		Chosen by Starfleet to represent a 
		threat not only to the Federation, but to the entire galaxy. 
		Only starship captains and Federation Flag Officers have been 
		briefed on the nature of this threat. What you're about to hear 
		will not go beyond these bulkheads, is that clear? Good. <br>(She calls up a rotating image on the wall screen.)<br>JANEWAY: This is Omega. <br>
		PARIS: A molecule? <br>
		JANEWAY: Not just any molecule. The most powerful substance known to exist. 
		A single Omega molecule contains the same energy as a warp core. 
		In theory, a small chain of them could sustain a civilisation. The 
		molecule was first synthesised over a hundred years ago, by a Starfleet 
		physicist named Ketteract. I think he was hoping to develop an inexhaustible power source. <br>
		SEVEN: Or a weapon. <br>
		JANEWAY: Ketteract managed to synthesise a single molecule particle of Omega, 
		but it only existed for a fraction of a second before it destabilised. <br>(Another image. A space station with a big hole in it.)<br>JAEWAY: This was 
		a classified research station in the Lantaru Sector. Ketteract and one hundred 
		twenty six of the Federation's leading scientists were lost in the accident. 
		Rescue teams attempting to reach the site 
		discovered an unexpected secondary effect. There were subspace 
		ruptures extending out several light years. <br>
		PARIS: The Lantaru Sector. It's impossible to create a stable warp field there. 
		You can only fly through it at sublight speeds. I was always told that 
		was a natural phenomenon. You're saying it was caused by a single molecule of this stuff? <br>
		JANEWAY: Omega destroys subspace. A chain reaction involving a handful of molecules 
		could devastate subspace throughout an entire Quadrant. If that were to happen, 
		warp travel would become impossible. Space-faring civilisation as we know it would 
		cease to exist. When Starfleet realised Omega's power, they suppressed all knowledge of it. <br>
		EMH: Have you detected Omega here, in the Delta Quadrant? <br>
		JANEWAY: I'm afraid so. I've been authorised to use whatever means necessary to destroy it. Tom, 
		I've calculated the location of the molecules. I'll transfer the coordinates 
		to the helm. Take us there at full impulse. <br>
		PARIS: Aye, Captain. <br>
		JANEWAY: I don't have to tell you what's at stake. If a large-scale Omega 
		explosion occurs, we will lose the ability to go to warp forever. We've got our work cut out for us.

entry. We're approaching the star system where we believe we'll find
Omega. I have to admit, I have never been this apprehensive about a
mission. I know how Einstein must have felt about the atom bomb, or
Marcus when she developed the Genesis device. They watched helplessly
as science took a destructive course. But I have the chance to prevent
that from happening. I just hope it's not too late. </font></p><p>

		SEVEN: This is a harmonic resonance chamber. The Borg designed it to contain and stabilise Omega. <br>
		JANEWAY: I thought I asked you to work on the photon torpedo. <br>
		SEVEN: The torpedo may be insufficient. I can modify this chamber to emit an inverse frequency. 
		It will be enough to dissolve Omega's interatomic bonds. <br>
		JANEWAY: Here's to Borg ingenuity. This is excellent work, Seven. We may need this. <br>
		SEVEN: The modifications require several complex calculations. Assist me. <br>
		JANEWAY: I guess I will. I'm curious. When did the Borg discover Omega? <br>
		SEVEN: Two hundred twenty nine years ago. <br>
		JANEWAY: Assimilation? <br>
		SEVEN: Yes, of thirteen different species. <br>
		JANEWAY: Thirteen? <br>
		SEVEN: It began with Species two six two. They were primitive, but their 
		oral history referred to a powerful substance which could burn the sky. 
		The Borg were intrigued, which led them to Species two six three. They too 
		were primitive, and believed it was a drop of blood from their Creator. <br>
		JANEWAY: Fascinating. <br>
		SEVEN: Yes, but irrelevant. We followed this trail of myth for many years until 
		finally assimilating a species with useful scientific data. We then created the molecule ourselves. <br>
		JANEWAY: Omega caused quite a stir among my own species. Federation cosmologists 
		had a theory that the molecule once existed in nature for an infinitesimal period 
		of time at the exact moment of the Big Bang. Some claimed Omega was the primal source of 
		energy for the explosion that began our universe. <br>
		SEVEN: A creation myth like any other. <br>
		JANEWAY: Perhaps. What is it the Borg say? That Omega is perfect? <br>
		SEVEN: Yes. <br>

		ALLOS: Obviously, it wasn't. <br>

		Every Drone is aware of its existence. We were instructed to assimilate it
