For our third course, luhvian quail in truffle sauce, served with
roasted chadre kab. <br>
JANEWAY: My compliments to the chef. <br>

SEVEN: Thank you, Captain. <br>
TORRES: Cream of leola soup, fettran risotto, luhvian quail. It just
keeps getting better. <br>
JANEWAY: I knew you'd been expanding your palate, but I didn't realise
you'd become a gourmet cook. <br>
SEVEN: Preparing meals myself is the best way to ensure quality. <br>
NEELIX: I suppose I should be insulted but everything is so delicious I
may just have to admit defeat and hang up my apron. <br>
PARIS: No, that'd be a real tragedy, Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: Pinot noir, Commander? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'll have another glass of the Chardonnay. <br>
SEVEN: Each course has been paired with a specific wine. Substitutions
are not recommended. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The Pinot noir sounds perfect. <br>

SEVEN: Additional seasoning is not required. <br>

SEVEN: If the quail hasn't been prepared to your satisfaction, I could

JANEWAY: Hail them. <br>
KIM: They're not responding. <br>
JANEWAY: Return fire. Can you identify them? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Their weapon signature is Vaadwaur, but the ship has
technology from several different species. <br>
SEVEN: There's another vessel approaching. It's charging weapons. <br>
JANEWAY: Evasive pattern beta six. <br>(The newcomer attacks the first ship.)<br>

JANEWAY: Hail the second ship. <br>
KIM: No response. <br>(A console explodes.)<br>
PARIS: I stand corrected. <br>
TUVOK: They've penetrated our aft shields. <br>
JANEWAY: Reroute power to the auxiliary emitters and return fire. <br>(Containers disappear from a cargo bay, plants from Airponics, a console and tool box from Engineering.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: They've transported material off decks five, seven and eight.
<br>
JANEWAY: Disable their engines. <br>(But the ship jumps to warp.) <br>JANEWAY: Follow them. <br>
PARIS: Navigational sensors are malfunctioning. It's something to do
with this environment. <br>
JANEWAY: I want a full damage report and an inventory of everything
that was taken off this ship. And I want to know where we are. <br>
CHAKOTAY: They got more than ninety percent of our food stores,
including almost everything in the Airponics bay. They also got a
computer console from Engineering and they emptied three of our
deuterium tanks. <br>
PARIS: Why would anyone steal deuterium? You can find it anywhere. <br>
SEVEN: Apparently not here. I'm not detecting any gases, stellar bodies,
or matter of any kind. <br>
JANEWAY: Except for the ships that attacked us. Scan for other vessels.
I want to know how many we're dealing with. <br>
TUVOK: There are more than one hundred fifty ships within scanning
range. But I'm only detecting lifesigns on twenty nine of them. <br>
KIM: Captain, there's another vessel approaching at high impulse. <br>
PARIS: Quite a welcoming committee they've got here. <br>
JANEWAY: What's the status of our shields? <br>
TUVOK: They're at twenty eight percent. <br>
JANEWAY: That'll have to do. Charge weapons. <br>
KIM: Captain, this one wants to talk. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. I'm Captain Janeway of the starship Voyager. <br>
VALEN [on viewscreen]: General Valen. Welcome to the Void. <br>
JANEWAY: You're the first ship we've seen here that hasn't tried to
fire on us. But in case you change your mind, we're prepared to defend
ourselves. <br>
VALEN [on viewscreen]: I know. I've been observing you on sensors. The
way you fought those ships was impressive. Most vessels don't survive
the first few minutes. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd appreciate any information you could give us about where
we are. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Briefing
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> VALEN:
The anomaly's a closed structure, encased by an inert layer of subspace.
Matter and energy can't penetrate it. <br>
JANEWAY: Our ships certainly penetrated it when we were pulled in. <br>
VALEN: By the funnels. But they only pull matter in one direction. Into
the void. <br>
TUVOK: Have you explored the entire anomaly? <br>
VALEN: There's nothing to explore, but it's big. We've calculated the
outer circumference at approximately nine light years, but we've never
been able to breech it. <br>
PARIS: How long have you been here? <br>
VALEN: More than five years. <br>
JANEWAY: There must be a way to escape. <br>
VALEN: New arrivals are always thinking about escape. <br>
JANEWAY: We have a sophisticated starship. Maybe if we work together we
can find a way out. <br>
VALEN: You're being naive. No one ever gets out. <br>
SEVEN: We may be able to devise a new approach. <br>
VALEN: Many have tried. All they did was waste resources that could
have kept them alive longer. Don't be foolish. I can help you. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How? <br>
VALEN: The only source of food and energy in the Void comes from new
ships that are drawn in. If you want to survive here, you'll have to
compete for their resources. <br>
JANEWAY: And I suppose you can help us do that? <br>
VALEN: I have tactical data on some of the more dangerous predators. <br>
JANEWAY: But you want something in return. <br>
VALEN: My scans show you have photon torpedoes. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry, we don't trade weapons. <br>
VALEN: Why not? <br>
JANEWAY: Because we have no way of knowing what they'll be used for.
Plundering innocent ships, for example. <br>
VALEN: Wait a few weeks until your resources start to run out. Morality
won't keep your life support systems running. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry, General. There are some compromises I won't make. <br>
VALEN: Not yet. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Report, Lieutenant. <br>
TORRES: We're using power at almost ten times the usual rate. <br>
CHAKOTAY: While we're standing still? <br>
TORRES: The same graviton forces that pulled us into the anomaly seem
to be draining the warp core. At this rate, our deuterium will be gone
in about ten days. <br>
JANEWAY: Shut down all non-essential systems. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Where are you going? <br>
JANEWAY: To find a way out of here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Astrometrics

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> SEVEN:
Using fractal algorithms with the Borg sensors I believe I can predict
where and when these funnels will occur. <br>
PARIS: Well, that's impressive, but how does it help us? <br>
SEVEN: The funnels originate inside the anomaly, creating massive
graviton forces before they erupt.
If we were to enter one of the funnels just as that happened we might
be able to use those forces to propel us into normal space. <br>
JANEWAY: Not without compromising structural integrity. <br>
TUVOK: I might be able to reinforce the shields to compensate. <br>
SEVEN: There's another problem. When the graviton forces reach critical
levels, the polarity suddenly reverses, pulling everything near the
funnel back into the anomaly. <br>
PARIS: We'd have to jump to warp at exactly the right moment. <br>
SEVEN: We'd need to achieve a velocity of warp eight point two. <br>
PARIS: Question is, will we have enough power? <br>
JANEWAY: At the rate we're losing it, we may only get one shot at this.
The sooner we try, the better. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> SEVEN:
There's a funnel forming seventy thousand metres off the port bow.
Bearing one three zero mark two four. <br>
KIM: Graviton surge in thirty four seconds. <br>
JANEWAY: Full power to shields and structural integrity. Take us in,
Mister Paris. <br>
SEVEN: Five seconds. Four, three. <br>
TUVOK: Structural integrity at twenty percent. Ten percent. <br>
PARIS: Fifty thousand kilometres to normal space. <br>
JANEWAY: Prepare to go to warp. <br>(Consoles go bang, and everyone gets thrown to the deck. They are still in the Void.) <br>
TORRES [OC]: Engineering to the bridge. <br>
JANEWAY: Go ahead. </font></p>

semi-darkness)<br>
JANEWAY: If nothing else, we learned some things that'll help us next
time. <br>
PARIS: With all due respect Captain, we don't even have warp drive
anymore. <br>
TORRES: I may be able to get it back online, but we still need
deuterium to get our basic systems running. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How long will our reserves last? <br>
TORRES: If we shut down life support on all but a few decks, deactivate
Astrometrics, turbolifts, ration replicator use, maybe a week. <br>
NEELIX: I used to make a living scavenging for supplies. Let me take
one of the shuttles. I might be able to find deuterium on one of those
abandoned ships. <br>
TUVOK: The shuttle would be too easy a target. <br>
JANEWAY: I appreciate the offer, Neelix, but we're safer if we stay
together. <br>
SEVEN: The shuttles may be useful in another capacity. <br>
JANEWAY: We could use their warp cores to augment power on Voyager. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We're still going to need more deuterium. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's track down the ship that raided us and get back what
they stole. <br>
TUVOK: We should do it quickly. I've detected a number of vessels
monitoring us. <br>
PARIS: The vultures are circling. <br>
JANEWAY: Vultures eat the dead, Mister Paris. We're not dead yet. </font></p>

The vessel's in visual range. <br>
JANEWAY: Shields. On screen. <br>(The ship is adrift and apparently on fire. Neat trick in a vacuum.)<br>
KIM: Looks like somebody got to them before we did. <br>
TUVOK: No lifesigns. <br>
JANEWAY: Scan for ion trails. Whoever did this probably has our
deuterium. <br>
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Is there anything left aboard that ship worth salvaging? <br>
KIM: Their technology and supplies have been picked clean. <br>
SEVEN: Not everything of value has been taken. The warp core has been
removed, but the casing that protected it is intact. It's composed of
tricesium. <br>
KIM: We can convert it into a power source. <br>
JANEWAY: Every little bit helps. Lock onto the core casing and beam it
to the cargo bay. </font></p>

With the additional power we could reactivate the Astrometrics lab. <br>
TORRES: I can think of some better uses. <br>
SEVEN: For example? <br>
TORRES: Oh, I don't know. Making sure there's air to breathe. This must
be where they cut through the casing to remove the core. <br>

How is he? <br>
EMH: His injury doesn't seem serious, but he won't let me close enough
to treat him. <br>
JANEWAY: My name's Captain Janeway. You're safe here. <br>
EMH: I've tried communicating with him. He doesn't appear to have any
verbal skills. <br>
JANEWAY: Do we know how he got on board? <br>
SEVEN: I believe he was transported along with the core casing. <br>
JANEWAY: We should have picked up his lifesigns. <br>
SEVEN: We're trying to determine why we didn't detect him. <br>
JANEWAY: That vessel he was on had no atmosphere. How did he survive? <br>
EMH: My scans show he can conserve oxygen. He has unusually large lung
capacity. And a voracious appetite. <br>
JANEWAY: Do you think that ship was his home? <br>
EMH: Maybe. But we can't send him back. He can't survive without oxygen
indefinitely. <br>
JANEWAY: We'll run scans for other members of his species. But until we
can find a safe place for him, let's make him as comfortable as
possible. <br>

[on viewscreen]: I knew I'd see you again, Captain. I expect you've
reconsidered my proposal. <br>
JANEWAY: We're not here to trade. We're here to take back what belongs
to us. <br>
VALEN [on viewscreen]: I don't know what you mean. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Our scans indicate you've got some of our food, one of our
consoles and a large quantity of our deuterium. <br>
VALEN [on viewscreen]: We didn't take any of that from you. <br>
JANEWAY: No. Apparently you killed the crew of another ship and took it
from them. We want it back. <br>
VALEN [on viewscreen]: That's not the way things work here. <br>
JANEWAY: Either you give it back, or we'll take it. <br>
PARIS: He's powering his engines. <br>
JANEWAY: Target his shields and fire. Lock onto whatever belongs to us
and transport it to the cargo bay. <br>
SEVEN: I'm detecting large quantities of food on his supply deck. <br>
PARIS: Maybe we should take it while we have the chance. <br>
JANEWAY: Is it ours? <br>
SEVEN: No, but our own reserves are running out. <br>
PARIS: Valen wouldn't hesitate to take it from us.<br>
JANEWAY: No, he wouldn't. We've got what's ours. Reverse course. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Doorbell.)<br>JANEWAY:
Come in. <br>(Chakotay and Tuvok enter.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: An updated inventory of our supplies. We got back less than
half of what was stolen. <br>
JANEWAY: Doesn't take two of you to deliver a PADD. What's on your mind?
<br>
CHAKOTAY: We want to be clear about what our policy's going to be while
we're here in the Void. <br>
JANEWAY: You think we should have taken Valen's food. <br>
TUVOK: Logic suggests we may have to be more opportunistic if we intend
to survive. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We may not like Valen's tactics, but he and his crew are still
alive after five years in here. <br>
JANEWAY: I was thinking about that myself. I thought maybe I could get
some guidance from the Federation Charter. I was hoping I'd find a
loophole that would allow us to take actions we ordinarily wouldn't
take. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Any luck? <br>
JANEWAY: The Charter's a statement of principles, not a practical
document. <br>
CHAKOTAY: No section on how to exist in a Void. <br>
JANEWAY: No. But I've become convinced that we've got to stick to our
principles, not abandon them. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Should the crew be ready to die for those principles? <br>
JANEWAY: If the alternative means becoming thieves and killers
ourselves, yes. But I'm betting that our principles are going to keep
us alive. <br>
TUVOK: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: The Federation is based on mutual cooperation. The idea that
the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Voyager can't survive
here alone. But if we form a temporary alliance with other ships, maybe
we can pool our resources and escape. <br>
TUVOK: As you've pointed out, the people we've encountered in this void
are thieves and killers. Such individuals are hardly ideal allies. <br>
JANEWAY: I agree. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Then who are we going to form an alliance with? <br>
JANEWAY: Anyone who agrees to play by our rules. No killing, no
stealing, and no giving up. <br>
TUVOK: Forgive me, Captain, but why would anyone who has survived by
killing and stealing suddenly agree to those terms? <br>
JANEWAY: We'll offer to share our food and medical supplies, and defend
ships that are attacked by raiders. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, maybe you'd better take another look at that
inventory. Our food and power reserves will be gone within a week. If
we start giving everything away <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe we'll only survive for two days instead of seven. On the
other hand, if we share what we have instead of hoarding it, we might
find other people willing to do the same. If we combine our technology,
we can find ways of improving our situation, and ultimately get the hell
out of this place. We may lose a little weight, gentlemen, but we won't
lose who we are. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Whenever a new ship gets pulled into the Void they're immediately
attacked. Instead of attacking it, you'd have to help defend the new
ship. <br>
GARON: And how is that in my interest? <br>
JANEWAY: It would encourage them to join our alliance. <br>
GARON: And if they refuse, then we raid them? <br>
TUVOK: Everyone in the Alliance must agree not to launch unprovoked
attacks. <br>
GARON: Then how are we supposed to get supplies? <br>
CHAKOTAY: The idea is to recruit new members, share technology and
resources. <br>
JANEWAY: We almost escaped the Void on our own. If we work together, I
believe we'll succeed. <br>
GARON: How many ships do you have in this Alliance? <br>
JANEWAY: You'd be the first. <br>
NEELIX: Technically, Captain, that's not correct. I consider myself the
first member of the Captain's coalition. Six years ago, I offered her
my services and the resources of my ship, and she's never failed to
help me when I needed her. <br>
GARON: It's a noble idea, Captain, but good intentions are like
deuterium reserves. They tend to get lost in the Void. <br>
JANEWAY: All I ask is that you consider our proposal. <br>
GARON: I will. <br>
JANEWAY: In the meantime, we'd like to offer you food and medical
supplies. <br>

Captain, there's been a theft. <br>
JANEWAY: What's missing? <br>
SEVEN: My phase compensator. No doubt it was stolen by one of your
prospective members. <br>
JANEWAY: It wasn't stolen. I gave it to the Nygeans. They needed it to
repair their sensor array. <br>
SEVEN: I presume you obtained something equally valuable in return. <br>
JANEWAY: I think I did. The goodwill of a potential ally. <br>
SEVEN: Did they join? <br>
JANEWAY: Not yet. <br>
SEVEN: Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: I know. It's not exactly the most efficient policy. But then
you don't always do what's most efficient either. <br>
SEVEN: I don't know what you're implying. <br>
JANEWAY: You gave up your rations to our guest in Sickbay. <br>
SEVEN: He needed food. <br>
JANEWAY: You're a valuable member of this crew. Your friend in Sickbay
is nothing but a drain on resources. What's efficient about wasting
food on him? You think I'm being inefficient, Tuvok thinks I'm being
illogical. You both could be right. But maybe the best way to get help
is to give it. Oh, and Seven? <br>

Fantome seems to be a music lover. <br>
SEVEN: Fantome? <br>
EMH: After the Phantom of the Opera, a tormented character who was
soothed by music. <br>
SEVEN: In six years you haven't chosen a name for yourself, but you've
given Fantome one in a few days. <br>
EMH: Choosing the right name for myself is extremely difficult. I'm a
complex individual. <br>
SEVEN: And Fantome isn't? <br>
EMH: On the contrary. I believe he's quite intelligent, and his
physiology is very sophisticated. Did you know he has the ability to
refract his own lifesigns? <br>
SEVEN: That would explain why our sensors didn't detect him. <br>
EMH: I wish we could find a way to communicate with him. I suspect he'd
have a lot to tell us. <br>(Seven stops the playback.) <br>EMH: We were enjoying

TUVOK: Two warships are approaching it. One of them is Valen's. <br>(Valen opens fire on the newcomer.)<br>
JANEWAY: Target Valen's weapons, and hail him. <br>
VALEN [on viewscreen]: My fight's not with you, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Then stand down. <br>
VALEN [on viewscreen]: This new ship has impressive technology. We can
share it. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm not here to divide the spoils. <br>
VALEN [on viewscreen]: Then why are you here? <br>
JANEWAY: To protect the ship you're firing on. <br>
VALEN [on viewscreen]: What are they to you? <br>
JANEWAY: Just some people in a bad situation, like the rest of us. <br>
VALEN [on viewscreen]: Save your speeches. I've got a crew to feed. <br>
CHAKOTAY: He's targeting our shields. <br>
JANEWAY: Take his weapons out. Hail the new ship. <br>
LOQUAR [on viewscreen]: I surrender. <br>(An Overseer from the Heirarchy.)<br>
JANEWAY: We're here to help you. Can you target the smaller warship? <br>
LOQUAR [on viewscreen]: We're a survey vessel. We're not equipped to
fight. <br>
TUVOK: Shields at sixty percent <br>
JANEWAY: Fire torpedoes. <br>
TUVOK: Shields on Valen's lead ship are holding at eighty percent. It
appears he's upgraded them since we last met. <br>
JANEWAY: Ours? <br>
TUVOK: Thirty. <br>
PARIS: The smaller ship is <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">outmanoeuvring</span>

We should retreat, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Not yet. <br>
PARIS: You might want to reconsider. There's another ship approaching. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We can't defend ourselves against three ships. <br>
TUVOK: We may not have to. The third vessel belongs to Mister Garon.
He's firing at the other two.
Valen's shields are down. The smaller ship is leaking plasma. <br>
PARIS: They're both retreating. <br>
KIM: Garon's hailing. <br>
JANEWAY: Get a weapons lock on him. We've been fooled by unexpected
allies before. <br>
GARON [on viewscreen]: Why are you targeting me? <br>
JANEWAY: Because I don't know what your intentions are. <br>
GARON [on viewscreen]: Haven't I just made them clear? I've decided to
accept your offer. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, in that case, welcome to the Alliance. </font></p>

Neelix, we have another guest for dinner. <br>
NEELIX: Always room for one more, Captain. <br>
BOSAAL: Who did you raid to get fresh vegetables? <br>
JANEWAY: They're replicated. One of the crews that joined us had
technology that tripled our replicator efficiency. <br>
NEELIX: It may not be a gourmet feast, but we can feed five hundred
people a day now, using half the power it took us a few days ago. <br>

TUVOK: How's your patient? <br>
EMH: Technically, he's not a patient anymore, but it's taken me this
long to coax him out of Sickbay. He's quite shy. <br>(The EMH plays notes on a
PADD.) <br>EMH: I'm telling him not to worry, that you're the one who keeps us
all safe. <br>(Fantome plays notes on his PADD.) <br>EMH: He says thank you. <br>
TUVOK: An ingenious method of communication. <br>
EMH: It began with a few simple words, but now we're capable of
rudimentary conversation. <br>

JANEWAY: I beg your pardon? <br>
BOSAAL: They're vermin. <br>
EMH: I don't know who you are, sir, but your choice of words is
offensive. <br>
BOSAAL: What is offensive is the way they slip aboard during transport,
hide in conduits, steal food, spread disease. <br>
EMH: Fantome is perfectly healthy, and unlike some people in this Void,
he hasn't stolen anything. <br>
BOSAAL: If my sensors could detect where they are on my ship, I'd
exterminate them. I suggest you do the same. <br>
EMH: Captain, this is outrageous! <br>
JANEWAY: Doctor! One of the principles of our Alliance is that we don't
discriminate. Everyone's welcome as long as they follow the rules. But
if you're having a bad experience with the members of this species on
your ship, I'd be happy to bring them to Voyager. <br>
BOSAAL: If you could find them. <br>
JANEWAY: Now that we've had a chance to analyse Fantome's physiology, I
think we can get a transporter lock on them. <br>
BOSAAL: Is this your way of enticing me to join your Alliance? <br>

encompass all our ships, but we have no way to compensate for the
graviton stress. <br>
JANEWAY: Wouldn't a polaron modulator be able to do that? <br>

valuable. It may be difficult to convince anyone to part with it. <br>
JANEWAY [on screen]: You never know unless you ask. <br>
TUVOK: You are not authorised to be in here. <br>
LOQUAR: We're making a valuable contribution to the Alliance. <br>

LOQUAR: We've devised a new surveillance technique. <br>
JANEWAY [on screen]: Ask Harry to give you a hand. <br>
TUVOK: You've bypassed my security measures. <br>
LOQUAR: We can observe activity on any ship in the Void without being
detected. This is the cargo hold of the Jelinian freighter. Now, if I'm
not mistaken, the Jelinians
are a member of our Alliance. <br>
TUVOK: Which is why you shouldn't be spying on them. <br>

EMH: They did. Though strictly speaking, it's not a composition. It's
more of a conversation. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm impressed. <br>
EMH: I wish I could take credit but it was Fantome who taught the
others in a fraction of the time it took him to learn. They're a highly
intelligent species. <br>
SEVEN: The language is already developing its own grammar and syntax. <br>
JANEWAY: That suggests they have a language of their own. <br>
EMH: Mmm hmm. It could be telepathic, but they seem just as comfortable
communicating with music now. <br>
JANEWAY: Could their species be native to the Void? <br>
EMH: It's certainly possible. They told us they were born here. <br>

Just what we needed, Captain. A fully compatible polaron modulator. <br>

JANEWAY: Do they want to join our&nbsp;Alliance? <br>
BOSAAL: They're not interested. <br>

JANEWAY: You don't know that. <br>
BOSAAL Yes, I do. <br>
JANEWAY: You killed them. <br>
GARON: Captain, I don't like his tactics any more than you do, but why
waste this technology when we're so close to escaping? <br>
JANEWAY: Because it's a violation of everything this Alliance stands
for. <br>
GARON: Refusing the modulator won't bring back the people he killed. <br>
JANEWAY: No. But using it would make us accessories to murder. Take it
and get out. </font></p>

CHAKOTAY: The Jelinians and the Kraylor have left with Bosaal. They
felt you were being <br>
JANEWAY: Impulsive and self-righteous? Is that what you think? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You did what you had to do. <br>
JANEWAY: Still, I made a mistake. <br>
CHAKOTAY: By telling Bosaal to leave? <br>
JANEWAY Allowing him to join in the first place. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You couldn't have known what he was going to do. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, I had a pretty good idea what kind of person he was. That
bigoted reaction he had to the Doctor's friend told me all I needed to
know, but I ignored my instincts. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Why? <br>
JANEWAY: Because I thought his ship could help us escape. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You weren't the only one who wanted him in the Alliance. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe not. But if I'd listened to my doubts in the first place,
we wouldn't have lost the other two ships. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We'll find a way out of here without them. <br>
JANEWAY: Where do we stand with the modulator? <br>
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna and the other engineers are working around the clock
to build one. She thinks they'll be ready to test in a couple of days. <br>

them just a few minutes ago. <br>
VALEN [on screen]: Don't underestimate Janeway. I've been in battle
