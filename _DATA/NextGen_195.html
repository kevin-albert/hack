Captain's Log, Stardate 44769.2. For some weeks we have had a Klingon
exobiologist on board as part of a scientific exchange programme.
Unfortunately, we suspect that he was involved in a security breach and
in the possible sabotage of our warp drive.

RIKER: What were you doing accessing the propulsion system files on
Stardate 44758? <br>
J'DAN: I didn't. <br>
RIKER: Yes, you did, from computer twelve B nine, deck thirty six. The
computer logged in your identification from your communicator. <br>
J'DAN: It must be a mistake. <br>
TROI: J'Dan, we have confirmed reports that schematic drawings of our
dilithium chamber fell into Romulan hands one week later. <br>
J'DAN: I know nothing about it. <br>
RIKER: I suppose you know nothing about the explosion that disabled the
warp drive at approximately the same time? <br>
J'DAN: No. I was not involved. You accuse me because I am Klingon. <br>
TROI: Our Chief Security Officer is Klingon. That has nothing to do
with it. <br>
J'DAN: Send me home, then, if you are so distrusting. <br>
RIKER: We've already contacted the Klingon High Council. You'll be
returned home as soon as we finished our investigation. <br>
J'DAN: I have nothing more to say. <br>
RIKER: Very well. Worf, accompany the Lieutenant to his quarters. <br>
(Worf and J'Dan leave) <br>
RIKER: What do you think? <br>
TROI: It's hard to tell. He is very closed, but he is hiding something.

SATIE: Captain Picard. <br>
PICARD: Admiral Satie. Welcome aboard the Enterprise. <br>
SATIE: Delighted to be here. I managed to acquire my former staff. My
aide, Sabin Genestra, from Betazed, and my assistant, Nellen Tore, from
Delb Two. <br>
PICARD: This is my First Officer, Commander William Riker. May I show
you to your quarters? <br>
SATIE: Captain, if Starfleet Command is so concerned with your report
they brought me out of retirement, I think I should get right to work. <br>
PICARD: Very well. Commander Riker, will you see to the Admiral's
staff? <br>
SATIE: First, I'd like to inspect the damage to your engine room.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Admiral Satie, this is Commander Data,
Commander La Forge. <br>
LAFORGE: Admiral. We still can't get in there, Captain. The radiation
levels are dropping, but they're too high to raise the isolation door. <br>
PICARD: How much longer will it be? <br>
DATA: At the rate the levels are decreasing, we will gain entry in
forty nine hours, Captain. <br>
LAFORGE: Maybe the Admiral would like to see the visual log of the
explosion. <br>
SATIE: Yes. <br>
LAFORGE: This was logged four days ago at oh three hundred hours. <br>
(a picture on the monitor of the warp core, labelled sensor log
playback 44765.3 03.00.59.941. Part of the core goes bang) <br>
LAFORGE: At that point the emergency confinement field was activated
and the isolation doors came down. No one was killed, but I have two
people in Sickbay with radiation burns. <br>
SATIE: Have you been able to make any assessments? <br>
DATA: Slow motion study of the explosion suggests that the articulation
frame collapsed. <br>
SATIE: The schematics that were stolen from the Enterprise, I believe
some involved the articulation frame of the dilithium chamber. <br>
PICARD: That's one reason we tend to suspect sabotage. <br>
DATA: Other evidence lends credence to that theory, Captain. A review
of the sensor logs indicates that every systems reading was well within
normal parameters until fifty two milliseconds before the explosion. <br>
LAFORGE: We haven't found anything that suggests there was a
malfunction anywhere along the line. <br>
SATIE: Captain, I think I'm going to need a full briefing before we go
any further. <br>
PICARD: By all means, Admiral. <br>
SATIE: Commander Data, La Forge, I don't envy you your job. Good luck.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ready room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: There are disturbing overtones in the idea
of a Klingon providing information to the Romulans. Are you aware of
any other Klingon-Romulan connection that Starfleet Command might have
encountered recently? <br>
SATIE: I don't believe what Starfleet Command knows or doesn't know is
for me to reveal. <br>
PICARD: This ship has encountered several incidents which might suggest
a potential alliance between those two powers. <br>
SATIE: We're aware of that, Captain. What we must concentrate on is the
business at hand. <br>
(doorbell) <br>
PICARD: Come. <br>
WORF: Excuse me, Captain, I didn't know that <br>
PICARD: Please, Mister Worf, come in. I particularly want my guest to
meet you. Admiral Satie. This is my Head of Security, Lieutenant Worf. <br>
WORF: Captain, I have been pursuing the investigation of Lieutenant
J'Dan. I believe I know how he transferred information off the
Enterprise. <br>
SATIE: Well done, Lieutenant. <br>
WORF: (hands over a hypospray) This is J'Dan's. A hypospray he uses to
treat his Ba'ltmasor Syndrome. But this has been fitted with an optical
reader specially modified to read data from Starfleet isolinear chips.
He can extract digital information from a computer, encode it in the
form of amino acid sequences, and transfer those sequences into a fluid
in the syringe. Then he injects someone, perhaps even without their
knowledge. <br>
SATIE: Or perhaps with their knowledge. <br>
WORF: The information would be carried in their bloodstream in the form
of inert proteins. <br>
SATIE: The body itself becomes a conveyor of top secret files.
Lieutenant Worf, when we confront J'Dan, I want you to conduct the
interrogation. <br>
WORF: I would be honoured. Captain. Admiral. <br>
(Worf leaves) <br>
SATIE: Captain, I predict that officer will be extremely valuable in
this investigation.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Interrogation room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: I have tracked the movements of every person
who has left the Enterprise since you have been here. I traced one
Tarkanian diplomat as far as the Cruces system where he disappeared and
has not been seen since. <br>
J'DAN: That proves nothing. <br>
WORF: A hyposyringe was discovered in your quarters. <br>
J'DAN: I take injections. Everyone knows that. <br>
WORF: But your injections do not include an optical chip reader. This
device has but one function, to transform computer information into
biological sequences. <br>
J'DAN: The blood of all Klingons has become water. Since the Federation
alliance we have turned into a nation of mewling babies. Romulans are
strong. They are worthy allies. They do not turn Klingons into
weaklings like you. <br>
SATIE: Lieutenant, how did you damage the dilithium chamber? <br>
J'DAN: I had nothing to do with that <br>
SATIE: You mean it was sheer coincidence that it was sabotaged after
you gave the plans for the design to the Romulans? <br>
J'DAN: I do not know. I had nothing to do with it. <br>
SATIE: You've admitted your crime. Why lie now? <br>
J'DAN: I am not lying. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, you may have him confined. <br>
(Worf and J'Dan leave) <br>
SATIE: Sabin? <br>
SABIN: I believe he's telling the truth. He admits stealing the files
but not sabotaging the dilithium chamber. I get no sense that he's
lying. <br>
PICARD: But if you're right, someone else may be involved. <br>
SATIE: I think, Captain, you have a bigger problem on your ship than
one Klingon exchange officer. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(the Admiral is serving tea, I think) <br>
SATIE: I've seen this before. The spectre of conspiracy on a starship
is a frightening one. <br>
PICARD: I can scarcely believe it myself, but I am so grateful for your
presence, Admiral. If anyone in Starfleet can help us, it's you. <br>
SATIE: Captain, I find myself changing my mind about you. <br>
PICARD: In what way? <br>
SATIE: When Starfleet ordered me here, it was with the express command
that we work together on this problem as equals. My father taught me to
avoid partnerships. Most of them are woefully lop-sided. <br>
PICARD: That sounds like Judge Aaron Satie. <br>
SATIE: You knew my father? <br>
PICARD: Only from his writings. His judgments were required reading at
the Academy. <br>
SATIE: He was an extraordinary man. Every night at the dinner table he
would pose a question for debate. My big brothers and I would wrangle
it around, from one side and the other. Father would referee, and he
kept a stopwatch on us so we'd have to learn brevity. But he wouldn't
let us leave until he thought we'd completely explored the issue. <br>
PICARD: I'm willing to wager that you trounced your brothers during
those debates. <br>
SATIE: More than once. Father loved it when I nailed one of them with
some subtle point of logic. All that I am, I owe to him. He was a
giant. <br>
PICARD: You must miss him very much. <br>
SATIE: Captain, I always preferred working alone. That way, if
something goes wrong, I don't have to go far for the cause. I resented
you being assigned to me, but I was wrong. We're going to be quite a
team.

Frankly, when I first heard about your father. <br>

SABIN: Yes. There are some who believe he betrayed your people to the
Romulans. <br>
WORF: What he did or did not do is no one's concern but my own <br>

you of anything. However, if you would like counsel, it can be provided
for you. <br>

PICARD: Tell me, how long have you held your appointment onboard this
vessel? <br>

SATIE: Mister Tarses, your records state that you were born on Mars
Colony. <br>
TARSES: That's right. <br>
SATIE: Then you are human? <br>
TARSES: Largely. My paternal grandfather was Vulcan. <br>
SATIE: Yes, I see that. Tell me, what is your relationship with the
Klingon, J'Dan? <br>
TARSES: Er, he, I mean, there's no relationship. He just came in for
his injections. <br>
SATIE: Did you give him those injections? <br>
TARSES: Sometimes. There were several of us. Actually, I might have
done it twice. <br>
SABIN: Did he ever make any comments that might, in retrospect, be
suspicious? <br>
TARSES: Not really. He hardly ever talked. <br>
SATIE: Did you ever see him outside Sickbay? <br>
TARSES: Once or twice in Ten Forward, with a group of people, but I
never had a conversation with him. <br>
SATIE: Thank you, Mister Tarses. I don't think there's need for more.
Captain? <br>
PICARD: You're excused, crewman. <br>
(Tarses leaves) <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf? <br>
SABIN: Wait. He's lying. He's desperately frightened. He's covering
something. <br>
PICARD: It's clear that he's frightened, but that's hardly an
indication <br>
SABIN: It's more than that. He wasn't truthful. He's covering a lie.
One so big it's overwhelming him. I think we've found the man.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ready room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Admiral. I have to tell you, you must not
expect me to permit any action against Mister Tarses solely on the
basis of Betazoid intuition. <br>
SATIE: Sabin has uncanny instincts. I've learned to trust them. <br>
PICARD: I'm not happy about this use of a Betazoid. <br>
SATIE: But you have a Betazoid counsellor. Surely you're aware of the
advantages. <br>
PICARD: There is a difference between a counsellor and an investigator.
<br>
SATIE: Are you saying you never use your counsellor during
interrogations? <br>
PICARD: Yes, I do, but I would not act solely on the basis of her
instinct. <br>
SATIE: Nor do I. <br>
PICARD: But you're asking, you're asking me to restrict Mister Tarses'
movements solely on the basis on Sabin's feeling. <br>
SATIE: If Counsellor Troi suggested to you that someone on the ship
were dangerous, would you not act on that? Observe him? Curb his
activity? <br>
PICARD: Yes, I admit I probably would. And perhaps I should re-evaluate
that behaviour. <br>
SATIE: Oh, nonsense. Let's keep our priorities straight. The important
thing is to uncover the conspiracy on this ship and
to prevent further damage. Now, if Tarses is a possible saboteur, you
cannot allow him access to sensitive areas of the ship, and I strongly
suggest continuous surveillance. <br>
PICARD: If we had clear evidence. <br>
SATIE: We will have clear evidence. Sabin and Lieutenant Worf are
continuing to investigate. But if you don't act until then, it may be
too late. <br>
PICARD: No. I won't treat a man as a criminal unless there is cause to
do so. <br>
SATIE: And while you're being so generous, you give a saboteur a chance
to strike again. Last time it was just a hatch
cover/ What if next time it's more serious? What if lives are lost? Can
you afford not to act? <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: Engineering to Captain Picard. <br>
PICARD: Yes, Mister La Forge. <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain, could you come to Engineering right away? We've
got something interesting to show you. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAFORGE: Captain, we finally got in here about six
hours ago. We've been going over it inch by inch ever since. <br>
DATA: We have made micro-tomographic analyses of the dilithium chamber,
the hatch mounting, the blast pattern from the explosion. <br>
LAFORGE: We did mass spectrometer readings of the residue for chemical
content, sifted
through the debris for bomb fragments. <br>
SATIE: What did you find? <br>
LAFORGE: This is the frame for the hatch. It ruptured right along here.
When we take a reading of that spot. See? <br>
SATIE: I'm afraid I'm out of my element, Commander. You'll have to
interpret for me. <br>
PICARD: There are submicron fractures in the metal casing. <br>
LAFORGE: That's right. A breakdown of the atomic cohesive structure. <br>
SATIE: Yes? And what caused them? <br>
DATA: Those fractures suggest nothing more than simple neutron fatigue.
I would speculate that when the engine was last inspected at McKinley
station, the hatch casing was replaced with one which had an
undetectable defect. I believe, sir, that the conclusion to our
investigation must be that the explosion was not intentional. <br>
LAFORGE: That's the way I see it. This wasn't sabotage at all. It was
nothing more than an accident.

PICARD: If my crew say there was no sabotage, then you can be sure
there was none. <br>
SATIE: Let us keep our perspective, gentlemen. Just because there was
no sabotage doesn't mean there isn't a conspiracy on this ship. We do
have a confessed spy. <br>
SABIN: And he had confederates. <br>
PICARD: Do we know that for sure? <br>
SATIE: Of course he did. Do you think J'Dan could have come on board
the flagship of the Federation and accomplished what he did without
help from within? <br>
PICARD: I agree it would be difficult, but not impossible. <br>
WORF: We should continue to investigate Tarses. He was hiding
something. <br>
SABIN: Captain Picard Lieutenant Worf and I have been working well
together. I suggest we continue, if for no other purpose than to
determine Tarses' innocence. <br>
PICARD: Now, please! Let me remind you he is innocent until he is
proved guilty. <br>
SATIE: Of course he is. What Sabin is saying is that he and Lieutenant
Worf would like to establish his innocence unequivocally, for his own
sake. <br>

SATIE: It isn't good to have closed door proceedings for too long. It
invites rumour and speculation. <br>
PICARD: Nevertheless, Admiral, I think it would be wise <br>
SATIE: Because spies and saboteurs don't like the bright light of an
open inquiry. They're like roaches, scurrying for the dark corner. <br>

inquiry into the activities of Crewman Simon Tarses. Mister Tarses, for
your own protection, I have assigned a counsel to you in the person of

anything wrong. <br>

CRUSHER: Well, yes, he gave him his injection. <br>
SATIE: I meant outside of Sickbay. <br>
CRUSHER: I think so, perhaps in Ten Forward. <br>
SATIE: And whom else have you observed at these occasions? <br>
CRUSHER: I don't understand what relevance that has. It was an innocent
social gathering. <br>
SATIE: If it was so innocent, why do you hesitate to give us the names?

Tarses, you had better make it, otherwise I'm stopping this here and
now. <br>
SABIN: Mister Tarses. Isn't it true that you have access to the
biological supplies in Sickbay? <br>
TARSES: It's part of my job, yes. <br>
SABIN: J'Dan used suspensions of deoxyribose to carry the encoded files
he stole. Isn't it true one of your duties is to prepare those
suspensions? <br>
TARSES: Several technicians share that job. <br>
SABIN: And isn't it true that your security clearance allows you access
to all the stores and files in Sickbay? Access which you can exercise
at any time? <br>
TARSES: Because I have access does not mean I <br>
SABIN: What would you say if I told you there is evidence that the
explosion in the engine room was caused by a corrosive
chemical. One that is kept stored in Sickbay. <br>
TARSES: I had nothing to do with that. <br>
SABIN: How can we believe you? How can we believe someone whom we know,
we know, to be a liar? <br>
RIKER: I object! There is no basis for calling Crewman Tarses a liar. <br>
PICARD: Agreed. Mister Sabin. <br>
SABIN: Captain, there is a basis which will become clear in a moment.
Mister Tarses, didn't you deliberately and
premeditatively lied when you filled out your personnel application and
compounded that lie by repeating it to this committee? <br>
TARSES: What? <br>
SABIN: Isn't it true that the paternal grandfather of whom you speak
was not a Vulcan but was in fact a Romulan? That it is
Romulan blood you carry and a Romulan heritage that you honour? <br>

WORF: Sir, if a man were not afraid of the truth, he would answer. <br>
PICARD: Oh, no. We cannot allow ourselves think that. The Seventh
Guarantee is one of the most important rights granted by the
Federation. We cannot take a fundamental principle of the Constitution
and turn it against a citizen. <br>
WORF: Sir, the Federation does have enemies. We must seek them out. <br>
PICARD: Oh, yes. That's how it starts. But the road from legitimate
suspicion to rampant paranoia is very much shorter than we think.
Something is wrong here, Mister Worf. I don't like what we have become.

PICARD: There you are, Mister Tarses. Would you care for some lemon? <br>
TARSES: No, thank you, sir. This is fine. <br>
PICARD: Well, tell me a little about yourself, Crewman. I know you were
born on Mars Colony. <br>
TARSES: Yes, sir. All my life I wanted to be in Starfleet. I went to
the Academy's training programme for enlisted personnel. I took
training as a medical technician and I served at several outposts. The
day that I was posted to the Enterprise was the happiest day of my
life. <br>
PICARD: Did you ever consider applying to the Academy, going the whole
route, apply to become an officer? <br>
TARSES: My parents wanted me to. And then I thought about it. I used to
sit under this big tree near the parade grounds <br>
PICARD: An elm tree with a circular bench? <br>
TARSES: Yes, that's the one. <br>
PICARD: I spent many an hour there. It was my favourite spot to study. <br>
TARSES: I used to sit under that tree and watch the drills, picture
myself an officer. I know that it would have made my mother very happy,
but. <br>
PICARD: You didn't do it. <br>
TARSES: No. I was eighteen, and eager. The last thing I wanted to do
was spend four years sitting in classrooms. I wanted to be out there,
travelling the stars. I didn't want to wait for anything. And now it's
done, isn't it? My career in Starfleet is finished. <br>
PICARD: Not if you aren't guilty, Simon. <br>
TARSES: It doesn't matter. I lied on my application, and that mistake
will be with me for the rest of my life. </font></p>

Contact someone there and have him interviewed. <br>
PICARD: Admiral Satie? <br>

PICARD: Admiral Satie? <br>
SATIE: Yes, Captain? <br>
PICARD: I would like to have a word with you. <br>
SATIE: Of course. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SATIE: I cannot possibly believe you mean this. <br>
PICARD: But I do. This must stop. It has gone too far. You lied to him
about the Engine Room. There were no volatile chemicals found there. <br>
SATIE: It was a tactic. A way of applying pressure. <br>
PICARD: We are hounding an innocent man. <br>
SATIE: And how, may I ask, have you managed to determine that? <br>
PICARD: I've talked with him. <br>
SATIE: I see. And he told you he was a victim of circumstance,
blameless and pure. <br>
PICARD: No, he admits his mistake in falsifying his application. That
does not make him a traitor. <br>
SATIE: How can you be so incredibly naive? Captain, may I tell you how
I've spent the last four years? From planet to Starbase to planet. I
have no home. I live on starships and shuttlecraft. I haven't seen a
family member in years. I have no friends. But I have a purpose. My
father taught me from the time I was a little girl still clutching a
blanket, that the United Federation of Planets is the most remarkable
institution ever conceived. And it is my cause to make sure that this
extraordinary union be preserved. I cannot imagine why you are trying
to block this investigation. There have been others in the past who
doubted me. They came to regret it. <br>
PICARD: The hearings on Simon Tarses will stop. If necessary, I will go
to Starfleet Command. <br>
SATIE: I have news for you, Captain. I've been in constant contact with
Starfleet Command. The hearings are not going to stop. They're going to
be expanded. <br>
PICARD: What are you saying? <br>
SATIE: I'm going to get to the heart of this conspiracy if it means
investigating every last person on this ship. And every hearing from
now on will be held in the presence of Admiral Thomas Henry of
Starfleet Security. I've requested he be brought here at once. <br>
PICARD: You never told me about this. <br>
SATIE: I report to Starfleet Command directly. I do not need your
permission or your approval for my decisions. <br>
PICARD: Admiral, what you're doing here is unethical. It's immoral.
I'll fight it. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SABIN: Your full name? <br>
PICARD: Jean-Luc Picard. <br>
SABIN: Rank and position? <br>
PICARD: Captain, Federation Starship Enterprise. <br>
SABIN: How long have you held this post? <br>
PICARD: For three years, since stardate 41124. <br>
SABIN: Very well. Admiral? <br>
PICARD: If you don't mind, there's something I'd like to say. <br>
SATIE: If you have a statement, you'll have an opportunity to make it
later. <br>
PICARD: I believe that Chapter Four, Article Twelve of the Uniform Code
of Justice grants me the right to make a statement before questioning
begins. <br>
SATIE: Very well. <br>
PICARD: I am deeply concerned by what is happening here. It began when
we apprehended a spy, a man who admitted his guilt and who will answer
for his crime. But the hunt didn't end there. Another man, Mister Simon
Tarses, was brought to trial and it was a trial, no matter what others
choose to call it. A trial based on insinuation and innuendo. Nothing
substantive offered against Mister Tarses, much less proven. Mister
Tarses' grandfather is Romulan, and for that reason his career now
stands in ruins. Have we become so fearful? Have we become so cowardly
that we must extinguish a man because he carries the blood of a current
enemy? Admiral, let us not condemn Simon Tarses, or anyone else,
because of their bloodlines, or investigate others for their innocent
associations. I implore you, do not continue with this proceeding. End
it now. <br>
SATIE: Captain, do you believe in the Prime Directive? <br>
PICARD: Of course. <br>
SATIE: In fact, it's Starfleet General Order Number One, is it not? <br>
PICARD: Your point, Admiral? <br>
SATIE: Would it surprise you to learn that you have violated the Prime
Directive a total of nine times since you took command of the
Enterprise? I must say, Captain, it surprised the hell out of me. <br>
PICARD: My reports to Starfleet document the circumstances in each of
those instances <br>
SATIE: Yes, we're looking into those reports, Captain, very closely
into those reports, after which I'm sure we'll have more questions for
you about your so-called commitment to Starfleet's Prime Directive. <br>
SABIN: Captain, could you tell us just what happened on Stardate 44390?
<br>
PICARD: I beg your pardon? <br>
SABIN: Let me refresh your memory. You were transporting a Vulcan
ambassador, T'Pel. <br>
PICARD: I was following orders to take this ambassador to a location
near the Neutral Zone. <br>
SATIE: I don't think we need the preamble. <br>
SABIN: In fact, she was not a Vulcan at all, was she? She was a Romulan
spy. <br>
PICARD: That's correct. <br>
SABIN: A spy whom you were delivering back into the hands of the enemy.
<br>
SATIE: Tell me, Captain, when the deception was revealed and she stood
proudly on the bridge of a Romulan ship, did you make any effort to
retrieve her? <br>
PICARD: No. <br>
SATIE: No. Even though you knew she carried Federation secrets that
she'd been accumulating for years? <br>
WORF: The Enterprise could have been captured by the Romulans! Captain
Picard did the only thing he could. <br>
SATIE: Really, Lieutenant? And where were you when this traitor was on
board the Enterprise? Where was ship's Security? <br>
SABIN: Don't you think it's questionable judgment, Captain, to have a
security officer whose father was a Romulan collaborator? <br>
(Worf takes a couple of steps forward) <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant. <br>
SATIE: Tell me, Captain, have you completely recovered from your
experience with the Borg? <br>
PICARD: Yes, I have completely recovered. <br>
SATIE: It must have been awful for you, actually becoming one of them,
being forced to use your vast knowledge of Starfleet operations to aid
the Borg. Just how many of our ships were lost? Thirty nine? And a loss
of life, I believe, measured at nearly eleven thousand. One wonders how
you can sleep at night, having caused so much destruction. I question
your actions, Captain. I question your choices. I question your
loyalty. <br>
PICARD: You know, there some words I've known since I was a school boy.
With the first link, the chain is forged. The first speech censured,
the first thought forbidden, the first freedom denied, chains us all
irrevocably. Those words were uttered by Judge Aaron Satie as wisdom
and warning. The first time any man's freedom is trodden on, we're all
damaged. I fear that today <br>
SATIE: How dare you! You who consort with Romulans invoke my father's
name to support your traitorous arguments. It is an offence to
everything I hold dear. And to hear those words used to subvert the
United Federation of Planets. My father was a great man. His name
stands for integrity and principle. You dirty his name when you speak
it. He loved the Federation, but you, Captain, corrupt it. You
undermine our very way of life. I will expose you for what you are.
I've brought down bigger men than you, Picard! <br>
(Admiral Henry walks out) <br>
SATIE: I have nothing more to say. <br>
SABIN: Perhaps we should call a recess until tomorrow.

PICARD: That's good. <br>
WORF: Admiral Satie has left the Enterprise. <br>
PICARD: We think we've come so far. The torture of heretics, the

blink an eye, it suddenly threatens to start all over again. <br>
WORF: I believed her. I helped her. I did not see what she was. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, villains who wear twirl their moustaches are easy
to spot. Those who clothe themselves in good deeds are well
camouflaged. <br>
WORF: I think after yesterday, people will not be as ready to trust
her. <br>
PICARD: Maybe. But she, or someone like her, will always be with us,
waiting for the right climate in which to flourish, spreading fear in
the name of righteousness. Vigilance, Mister Worf, that is the price we
have to continually pay. </font> </p>
