And, since I was the only crewmember who could survive the corrosive
atmosphere, it was up to me to retrieve the data module and save the
day. Ah, here I am, mission accomplished. Then of course there was the
perilous mission to Lav'oti V. You remember that one, don't you Mister
Paris? <br>
PARIS: How could I forget. <br>
EMH: Here you are after your unfortunate slip into the fetid mud pits
of Palomar. <br>(Torres laughs.)<br>
PARIS: Hey, I was pushed. <br>
EMH: Of course you were. <br>
JANEWAY: Thank you, Doctor. We've all enjoyed your holo-images
enormously. <br>
EMH: Oh, but I haven't finished yet.<br>
TORRES: There's more? <br>
EMH: The best is yet to come, Lieutenant. I've created a fascinating
twelve part holographic essay which I call 'Under the Skin'. Humanoid
anatomy as art. Let's begin with this stunning magnification of the
Vulcan reproductive gland. Note the composition, the subtle variations
in colour. </font></p>

KIM: They've been in there over an hour. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm aware of that. <br>
KIM: Didn't the Captain ask you to rescue them after thirty minutes? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Harry, you and I were lucky enough to enjoy the Doctor's

funny. <br>
NEELIX: You mean like the one where Tom slipped into a mud pit? <br>
TORRES: You're famous. <br>

I'm reading a massive energy wave nine hundred thousand kilometres off
the starboard bow, heading right for us. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Source? <br>
TUVOK: Unknown. <br>
JANEWAY: Shields up. Evasive manoeuvres. <br>
KIM: The wave just changed course. It seems to be tracking us! <br>
JANEWAY: Go to warp eight! <br>
CHAKOTAY: Too late! Engines are down. <br>
JANEWAY: Everybody hang on! <br>(The wave overtakes them, then leaves them in peace.) <br>JANEWAY: All stop. <br>
TUVOK: Shields are holding. Minor damage to the hull plating on deck
fifteen. <br>
CHAKOTAY: No injuries. <br>
JANEWAY: Stand down red alert. <br>
KIM: Captain, when the wave hit our communications array received a
download. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What sort of download?<br>
KIM: I'm not sure. Lots of information. I can't decipher it, but
there's an audio component. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's hear it. <br>(Short screeches.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Harry, try all the standard decryption algorithms.<br>
JANEWAY: It's strange. The wave followed us but it didn't cause any
damage. Instead, we get a download to our database. I'd say it's a
pretty good bet somebody's trying to tell us something. <br>
PARIS: The wave left a residual ion trail. We might be able to locate
its point of origin. <br>
JANEWAY: Set a course. <br>(Later, they arrive at a &nbsp;spaceship.)<br>JANEWAY: Looks like it's taken quite a beating. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Lifesigns? <br>
KIM: One. Non-humanoid. It's very faint. Probably injured. <br>
JANEWAY: Beam it to Sickbay. <br>
TUVOK: Are you sure that's wise, Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm betting that message we received was some sort of distress
call. And if we're going to help, I'd rather do it on Voyager. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(A long, four-armed crustacean with big eyes is lying on the surgical bay biobed.)<br>EMH:
The physiology is so unusual the tricorder can't make heads or tails of
it. The creature's obviously injured, but I haven't a clue how to treat
it or even diagnose it. <br>(Torres enters.)<br>
TORRES: My scans came up with something interesting, Captain. The
interfaces on the alien's vessel can only be activated chemically. I'm
guessing that this lifeform somehow interfaces directly with the ship's
systems using biochemical secretions to give commands. <br>
JANEWAY: That would explain how it can fly a ship. <br>
TORRES: I'm hoping this can also help us figure out <br>(The creature leaps through the bay's forcefield and onto Torres. Janeway grabs the security guard's phaser.)<br>
EMH: No! You'll hurt B'Elanna! <br>

It's piercing her neck! <br>(Later, Torres is on the biobed, unconscious, with the creature fastened on top of her.)<br>EMH:
Her heart and lungs are seriously compromised, and her kidneys are
failing. The creature's also secreting some kind of paralysing agent
into her bloodstream. <br>
PARIS: How do we get it off her? <br>
EMH: I can't remove it surgically, not without doing irreparable harm
to B'Elanna's organs. <br>
JANEWAY: Can we get a lock on the creature, transport it off? <br>
EMH: Not unless we want to beam B'Elanna's cardiopulmonary system along
with it. <br>
PARIS: We have to do something.<br>
EMH: No one is disputing that, Mister Paris. The question is what? If
I'm to have any hope of devising a treatment I'll need to brush up on
my exobiology. <br>
PARIS: What do you mean, brush up? Don't you have all this information
in your database? </font></p>

may be a walking medical encyclopaedia, but even I don't know
everything. My matrix simply isn't large enough. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe we can do better than giving you a crash course in
exobiology. Maybe we can provide you with a consultant. <br>
EMH: I'd be delighted, but how? <br>
JANEWAY: By isolating the computer's exobiology data files and merging
them into a an interactive matrix. <br>
PARIS: A hologram.<br>
JANEWAY: Exactly. <br>
EMH: That may not be as simple as it sounds. It would need to be nearly
as sophisticated as I am. Tactile interfaces, personality subroutines. <br>
PARIS: Harry could do it. <br>
JANEWAY: Search the database for the leading exobiologist. If you want to
add a personality, it may as well be based on a real person. I'll have
Harry meet you in holodeck two. <br>

change. </font></p>

still have my doubts about this, Doc. It's one thing to create a simple
hologram, but you're trying to merge an extensive database with an
interactive matrix. <br>

KIM: Computer, display a holographic simulation of Crell Moset. <br>(Moset appears.) <br>KIM: Have
you mentioned to anyone else that this guy's a Cardassian? <br>
EMH: What difference does it make? <br>
KIM: Maybe you haven't heard. They're not the friendliest folks in the
galaxy. <br>
EMH: I don't care if he's the nastiest man who ever lived, as long as
he can help us save B'Elanna. <br>
KIM: Good point. Computer, transfer all reference medical files to the

COMPUTER: Transfer complete. <br>
KIM: Now install personality subroutines and voice approximation. <br>

lifeform. <br>(The hologram speaks with an indistinct voice.)<br>
MOSET: I am Crell Moset, Chief Exobiology specialist Cardassia Prime
certified to perform all surgical procedures. <br>
EMH: This is going well. What's wrong? <br>
KIM: Some sort of overload in the interactive matrix. <br>
EMH: Can you clear it up? <br>
KIM: I'm trying. Computer, install a recursive algorithm. <br>

EMH: Certainly. <br>
MOSET: So, Doc, how can an old surgeon like me help a technological
marvel such as yourself? <br>
EMH: Oh, well, I've got a patient with a rather unusual problem. She's
become fused with a non-humanoid lifeform I know nothing about. <br>
MOSET: Non-humanoid exobiology happens to be one of my specialties. <br>
EMH: That's exactly why we've created your programme. <br>

EMH: It's physiology doesn't match any of the standard templates in our
database. <br>
MOSET: My guess would be a cytoplasmic lifeform. <br>
EMH: I agree. And from what I can tell it has co-opted her vital
systems. <br>
MOSET: She's Klingon. No, the cranial ridges are less pronounced.
Klingon-human hybrid. <br>
EMH: Exactly. Let's hope your instincts about the creature are equally
insightful. <br>
MOSET: I'm afraid this one is going to require more than a visual
assessment. You have an isomolecular scanner? <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> MOSET:
What do we know so far? <br>
EMH: The lifeform has taken control of her body at the autonomic
level, drawing proteins from her tissues, white blood cells from her
arteries. <br>
MOSET: Which can be interpreted in several ways. <br>
EMH: A form of attack? <br>
MOSET: I find it odd that a species would evolve an attack mechanism
that would leave it so vulnerable. Why not do it's damage and retreat? <br>
EMH: A parasite, perhaps? <br>
MOSET: Yes, I think so, but not any ordinary variety. It's unlikely it
could sustain itself like this over the long term. <br>
EMH: Its own systems are damaged. It's doing this as a stopgap measure,
to keep itself alive. <br>
MOSET: So the patient's heart, lungs, kidneys, they're all augmenting
the alien's damaged system. <br>
EMH: It's using B'Elanna as a life preserver. <br>
MOSET: But if it needs her to survive, it's not about to let go without
a fight. <br>
EMH: I'd like to think that's a fight you and I can win. <br>
MOSET: We do work well together. I just wish we had access to my
laboratory. It has all the instrumentation we would need. Well, we'll
just have to improvise. <br>

Impressive. Is this where you did your work on the Fostossa virus? <br>
MOSET: No. Actually, I was on Bajor at the time, during the Occupation.
A sad chapter in Cardassian history. We had no business being there,
but try telling that to the politicians. When I think of the resources
that were squandered, the lives that were lost. <br>
EMH: But from what I understand, you saved thousands of lives. <br>
MOSET: In retrospect, I don't know how. The military had everything
they needed but the civilian hospitals? No staff, the crudest
equipment. <br>
EMH: Don't tell me. You were forced to improvise. <br>
MOSET: Yes! <br>
EMH: I know what that's like. <br>
MOSET: I didn't have the resources to try traditional methods, so I
experimented with procedures that, that never would have occurred to me
under ordinary circumstances. The discovery of the cure was almost
accidental, really. <br>
EMH: You're being modest, Crell. <br>
MOSET: No. <br>
EMH: You made medical history. You won the Legate's Crest of Valour. <br>
MOSET: Awards aren't important, Doc. It's the work that matters. <br>
EMH: Of course. Still, the recognition of your peers, your government.
It must be very satisfying. <br>
MOSET: I'm sure you've made your share of breakthroughs. <br>
EMH: Naturally. Unfortunately, no one from Starfleet ever hears about
them. I toil in obscurity. <br>

about your accomplishments. <br>

MOSET: If we induce a neurostatic shock in one of these nodes, I believe
it will travel to the others. The creature will lose motor function and
we'll be able to remove it. <br>

TORRES: The Cardassian? You can leave him off. <br>
EMH: I'm surprised by your attitude, Lieutenant. I never took you for
someone who would make generalisations based on race. <br>
TORRES: When it comes to Cardassians, I'm guilty as charged. <br>
EMH: I understand your experience with them was unpleasant, but if you
give Crell a chance, I think you'll find that he's a friendly,
compassionate man. Not to mention a genius who's trying to save your

TABOR: That's Crell Moset. <br>
MOSET: Yes. Do I know you? <br>
TABOR: He killed my brother, my grandfather, hundreds of people. He's a
mass murderer! <br>
EMH: You must be mistaken. <br>
TABOR: It's no mistake. Moset performed experiments on living people.
Thousands of Bajorans were killed in his so-called hospital. <br>
EMH: Is this true? <br>
MOSET: No. No, he's. There must be some misunderstanding. <br>
TABOR: The liar! <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TABOR:
I can still remember the sounds his instruments made. The screams of
his patients. The smell. Chemicals and dead flesh. He operated on my
grandfather. Exposed his internal organs to nadion radiation. It took
six days for him to die. I promised myself I would never forget. <br>
EMH: You were very young. Is it possible your memory of these events is
inaccurate? <br>
TABOR: My memory's just fine. He blinded people so he could study how
they adapted. Exposed them to polytrinic acid just to see how long it
would take for their skin to heal. <br>
EMH: Ensign, the man you're accusing cured the Fostossa virus. He
stopped an epidemic that killed thousands of Bajorans. <br>
TABOR: By infecting hundreds of people so that he could experiment with
different treatments. Old, helpless people like my grandfather, because
he considered their lives worthless. <br>
EMH: How do you know this? <br>
TABOR: Everybody knew.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I remember some of the Maquis under my command talking about
an infamous Cardassian doctor. <br>
EMH: Could these simply have been rumours spread by Bajorans who hated
the Cardassians? <br>
TABOR: I was there. <br>
EMH: I don't understand why this isn't in our database. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The Cardassians didn't exactly publicise their wartime
medical practices. I wouldn't be surprised if the real Moset went on to
live a normal life. <br>
EMH: He's the Chairman of Exobiology at the University of Culat. <br>
TABOR: We may not be able to do anything about the real Moset,
Commander, but the programme should be destroyed. Every trace of that

SEVEN: We've been reviewing data on the Cardassian occupation of Bajor.
The alleged site of Moset's crimes. <br>
KIM: Strategic information, log entries kept in battle, sensor scans
from Starfleet vessels. This, for example. Requisition records from one
of Crell Moset's hospitals. <br>
SEVEN: He was purchasing biochemical agents, including every known
strain of the Fostossa virus. <br>
EMH: Of course he needed samples of the virus. That's how vaccines are
developed. <br>
KIM: Take a look at the requisition orders. <br>
EMH: Moset didn't ask for any of the enzymes normally required for
synthesizing a vaccine. <br>
KIM: It gets worse. Four days after he received the virus samples there
was a minor outbreak of Fostossa in the vicinity of his hospital. <br>
SEVEN: Prior to that date there had not been a single case in the
entire province. <br>
KIM: I have to report these findings to Commander Chakotay. <br>(Kim leaves.)<br>
SEVEN: It is curious. The Borg are accused of assimilating information
with no regard for life. This Cardassian did the same, and yet his
behaviour was tolerated. </font></p>

Ah, there you are. I'm almost ready to perform the surgery. <br>
EMH: Lieutenant Torres won't allow you to have anything to do with her
treatment. <br>
MOSET: Because of that Bajoran? <br>
EMH: We've gathered some corroborating evidence. It appears that he's
telling the truth. You committed a series of atrocities during the
Cardassian war. Thousands of Bajorans died on your surgical tables. <br>
MOSET: That's absurd. And even if it were true, I'm only a hologram, and
I have no memory of those events. They're not part of my programming. <br>
EMH: But you are the holographic representation of Crell Moset. Your
programme, despite all its brilliance, is based on his work. He
infected patients, exposed them to polytrinic acid, mutilated their
living bodies, And now we're reaping the benefits of those experiments.
Medically, ethically, it's wrong. <br>
MOSET: What do you suggest we do about it? <br>
EMH: I'm not sure. We may have to delete your programme. <br>
MOSET: Delete me? What about our patient? <br>
EMH: I suppose I'd have to try and treat her on my own. <br>
MOSET: No offence but, you need me. <br>
EMH: I realise that. <br>
MOSET: You're a physician. You know there's always a price to pay for
the advancement of medical science. <br>
EMH: Sometimes that price is too high. Torture? <br>
MOSET: Your word, not mine. I cured the Fostossa virus, didn't I? So
these experiments you say I conducted obviously helped me devise a
treatment. Imagine how many lives would have been lost if I hadn't
eliminated this disease. <br>
EMH: That doesn't justify using people in laboratory experiments. <br>
MOSET: As I explained to you, during the Occupation I was forced to
improvise. I used what resources I had. <br>
EMH: And ethical considerations, they mean nothing to you? <br>
MOSET: Ethics are arbitrary. How do you suppose your own database was
developed? Hmm? My God, half the medical knowledge acquired on Earth
came through experiments on lower animals. <br>
EMH: But not people. <br>
MOSET: It's convenient to draw a line between higher and lower species,
isn't it? <br>
EMH: This is the twenty fourth century, Crell. Your kind of barbarism
ended a long time ago. Or at least, it should have. <br>
MOSET: What difference does it make how long ago the research occurred?
What matters is that we can use it to help patients today. Now, are you
going to delete my programme and all of the research it contains, or
are we going to use it to save B'Elanna's life? </font></p>

running out of time. The fact is, you're both right, but when it comes

this situation later, after B'Elanna is back on her feet. Doctor, you

Consultant Programme and all the algorithms contained therein shall be
deleted from the database. In light of recent evidence I cannot in good
conscience utilise research that was derived from such inhuman
practices. <br>
MOSET: In good conscience? What about the well-being of your crew?

fact that you've already used some of my research. Where was your
conscience when B'Elanna was dying on that table? Ethics? Morality?
Conscience? Funny how they all go out the airlock when we need
something. Are you and I really so different? <br>
