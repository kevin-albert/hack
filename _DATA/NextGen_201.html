GOWRON: I do not hear the words of traitors. <br>

Khitomer, not mine.<br>

heir. <br>
TORAL: Follow me, and I will show you honour. <br>
GOWRON: Your blood will paint the way to the future.<br>

Federation into a Klingon civil war.<br>
GOWRON: You both fought as warriors. I return your family honour.<br>

incompatible with remaining on board a Klingon ship during a time of

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: There have been three major engagements in
the last two weeks, all of them won by ships loyal to the Duras family.
<br>
SHANTHI: (a lady Admiral of African descent) None of which is our
concern, Jean-Luc. The Klingon civil war is, by definition, an internal
matter of the Empire. <br>
PICARD: Agreed. But if the Duras are being aided by the Romulans, it
becomes very much our concern. The Romulans have been attempting to
destroy the Klingon-Federation Alliance for the past twenty years. At
the same time, the Duras have been secretly conspiring with the
Romulans. Doesn't it strike you as odd that the Duras are able to field
such an overpowering force against Gowron? That they outmatch him at
almost every turn? <br>
SHANTHI: Some would call it good leadership. <br>
PICARD: And some would say they must be getting help. The Romulans are
prepared to take enormous risks to gain any advantage over the
Federation. Can we seriously believe that now, with the future of the
Klingon Empire in the balance, they are content to stand by and watch? <br>
SHANTHI: What is it you propose, Captain? <br>
PICARD: We must stop the flow of supplies and equipment to the Duras
from the Romulans. What I propose is that we send a fleet to the
Romulan-Klingon border. We'll take no offensive action, but we will be
in a position to expose any Romulan supplies that attempt to cross the
border. <br>
SHANTHI: A blockade. <br>
PICARD: Exactly. <br>
SHANTHI: But how would you overcome the Romulan cloaking device? <br>
PICARD: My Chief Engineer has developed a system that should nullify
that advantage. Each ship will send out an active tachyon beam to the
other blockading ships. Now, in theory, any cloaked vessel that
attempts to pass between our ships must cross that beam and be
detected. <br>
SHANTHI: I'll have to clear this with the Federation Council. In the
meantime, assemble your fleet, Captain. <br>
(Shanthi and her aide leave) <br>
RIKER: Nicely done. I hope we know what we're doing. <br>
PICARD: So do I, Number One.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 45021.3. Convincing
Starfleet Command to establish a blockade was relatively painless.
Implementing that plan is proving more troublesome.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Starfleet is stretched pretty thin across
the quadrant. There are only about twelve ships within a day's travel
of this position. <br>
LAFORGE: The only other ships available are either in spacedock for
repairs or still under construction. Most of them don't even have full
crews yet. <br>
RIKER: We could probably scare up seven, maybe eight, more ships. <br>
PICARD: Mister La Forge, can you implement your tachyon detection grid
with twenty ships? <br>
LAFORGE: It's possible, but the more ships, the bigger the net we can
throw. <br>
PICARD: All right. I want to add the Tian Nan Men, the Sutherland and
the Hermes, whether the yard superintendent says they're ready or not.
Mister Data, will you select a group of experienced Enterprise officers
to augment the crews of those ships. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Will, I want you to command the Excalibur. Her crew was
reassigned when she put in for repairs. Geordi, you will be his First
Officer. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: I want the fleet underway by oh nine hundred tomorrow. Thank
you, gentlemen. <br>
(Riker and La Forge leave) <br>
PICARD: Yes, Mister Data? <br>
DATA: May I ask a question, sir, of a personal nature? <br>
PICARD: Yes. <br>
DATA: I am confused. Why have I not been assigned to command a ship in
the fleet, sir? <br>
PICARD: Well, I felt that you would be needed here. Why do you ask? <br>
DATA: You have commented on the lack of senior officers available for
this mission. I believe my twenty six years of Starfleet service
qualifies me for such a post. However, if you do not believe the time
has arrived for an android to command a starship, perhaps I should
address myself to improving my <br>
PICARD: Commander. I believe the starship Sutherland will need a
captain. I can think of no one better suited to the task than
you.&nbsp;<br>

have as many! <br>
LARG: You were lucky, Kurn, but luck always runs out. Someday I will
stand over your broken corpse and drink to the victory of the Duras! <br>
KURN: Ah, Worf, good. This piece of baktag is Captain Larg. He
commanded the squadron that tried to destroy us yesterday. <br>

That is the uniform of a Klingon! <br>

When we meet in battle, we will fight to the death, but here, here
we're all warriors, all Klingons. <br>
WORF: The repairs to the Hegh'ta are proceeding. The port stabilisers <br>
KURN: Is there nothing in your heart but duty? <br>
WORF: It is my responsibility. <br>
KURN: We all have responsibilities and duties, But you and I are
warriors fighting in a great war. Think of it. You and I will fight
battles that others can only dream of. The time for glory is here. It
is not a time to worry about stabilisers. It is a time to celebrate,
for tomorrow we all may die! Come, let us, the sons of Mogh, live this
night as if it were our last. <br>

I've reviewed all of Tasha's medical records, and there is no

these were only rumours. <br>

SELA: You want the answer to the only question on your mind. How could
Tasha Yar be my mother? <br>
PICARD: It's been suggested that she was aboard the Enterprise C when
it was destroyed twenty four years ago, that she was one of the
survivors and that obviously you are a product of a union between her
and a Romulan. <br>
SELA: But you know that's impossible. She would have been a child when
that battle occurred. <br>
PICARD: And yet you claim that it is possible, that you're the daughter
of Tasha Yar. <br>
SELA: Yes, she was on that ship twenty four years ago. She was sent
there by you from the future. She was among those few who survived.
They were all to have been executed after the interrogation, but a
Romulan general saw her and became enamoured with her. So a deal was
struck. Their lives would be spared if she became his consort. I was
born a year later. <br>
PICARD: I want to meet your mother. Can you arrange that? <br>
SELA: One night, when I was four years old, she came to me. She bundled
me up and she told me to stay quiet as we left the compound. I realised
she was taking me away. She was taking me away from my home, my father,
so I cried out. My father offered her life.
He gave her a home, gave her a child, and how did she repay him? By
betrayal. They executed her. Everything in me that was human died that
day with my mother. All that's left is Romulan. Never doubt that. <br>
PICARD: Doubts? I'm full of them. But nothing in my experience can
persuade me that what you have told me is true. And I do know one
thing. It will not affect my judgment at our next encounter. <br>
SELA: You have fourteen hours, Captain. I suggest you use them wisely.

WORF: An era where honour has no meaning? Where Klingons trade
loyalties in dark rooms and where the Empire is ruled from Romulus. <br>
SELA [on monitor]: Enough, Lursa. You failed. I need to know the
strength and capabilities of the Federation fleet. I don't have time
for this. Turn him over to the guard. B'Etor can have him back when
they've finished with him. <br>
ROMULAN: Come!

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: In thirteen hours we'll be forced to either
withdraw from the border or fight the Romulan fleet. Neither
alternative is acceptable. We must expose their involvement before the
deadline. <br>
GOWRON [on viewscreen]: What is it you propose? <br>
PICARD: If you launch a full-scale attack now, then the Duras fleet
will call for supplies. Lursa and B'Etor will call for help. The
Romulans will try to run the blockade, and we'll be ready for them. <br>
GOWRON [on viewscreen]: And once the Romulan connection has been
exposed, support will fall away from Lursa and B'Etor.
Very well. I will make preparations. One thing more, Picard. Worf has
been captured by the Duras. I hope he dies well. Qapla!

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: When Gowron begins his attack, then we will
make our move. Excalibur will fall back with engine problems. You will
take the Akagi and the Hornet to this position, which will open a small
gap in our detection net. <br>
RIKER: And if the Romulans are already aware of the tachyon field, they
should run the blockade at that point. <br>
PICARD: Exactly. When they try to bring their ships through, the
Enterprise and the Tian Nan Men will swing around, close the gap and
catch them in the act. <br>
RIKER: Very nice. I'd better get back. <br>
PICARD: Good luck, Will. <br>
RIKER: Good luck, Captain.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MOVAR: We've just received an urgent message from
Lursa and B'Etor. Gowron's forces have attacked in three sectors. The
Duras are nearing defeat. <br>
SELA: You mean they were caught unprepared and now they're crying for
help. Have the science sections found a way to circumvent the detection
grid yet? <br>
MOVAR: We think so. Just before we cross the border, we'll send out a
massive tachyon pulse. A burst that large should cause enough
interference to disable a part of their network. <br>
SELA: Good. <br>
MOVAR: One of their ships is moving off the blockade line. <br>
SELA: Their warp drive is failing. <br>
MOVAR: Picard is redeploying the fleet to compensate for the missing
ship. There's a gap opening in the net. <br>
SELA: He doesn't have enough ships to maintain the network. <br>
MOVAR: If we act quickly we can move through. Commander? <br>
SELA: No. I don't think so. <br>
MOVAR: But it's what we've been waiting for. <br>
SELA: Yes I know and so does Picard. He's giving us exactly what we
need and he expects us to take it. No. We won't step into Picard's
trap. We will disable part of his network here, where they're weakest.
We'll direct the energy burst right at the ship with the android
Captain.

PICARD: We're reading a disruption of the tachyon net in your area. <br>
DATA [OC]: Yes, sir. The Romulans have released a high energy burst.
The net is no longer effective in a radius of ten million kilometres
around the Sutherland. <br>
PICARD: That's where they're going through. Send a signal to the fleet.

HOBSON: What are you doing? <br>

residual tachyon signature to form around their own ships. <br>
HOBSON: But we have no way of detecting it. <br>
DATA: All stop. <br>
CRAIG: Aye, sir. All stop. <br>
HOBSON: Sir, the fleet's been ordered to Gamma Eridon. <br>
DATA: The tachyon signatures will not last long. By the time the fleet
is deployed, it will be too late. Begin to reconfigure the sensors to
detect ionised particle traces. <br>
HOBSON: The entire area's been flooded with tachyon particles. We'll
never be able to find what we're looking for. <br>
DATA: I am aware of the difficulties. Please bring the phasers back
online. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's personal log, stardate 45025.4. It is
with a profound sense of relief that I have ordered the fleet back to
Federation territory following the Romulan withdrawal and the news of
Gowron's victory. We have arrived at the Klingon home world, where I
will present the High Council with a full report on our encounter with
the Romulans. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Come. <br>
DATA: Captain, I wish to submit myself for disciplinary action. I have
disobeyed a direct order from a superior officer. Although
the result of my actions proved positive, the ends cannot justify the
means. <br>
PICARD: No, they can't. However, the claim 'I was only following
orders' has been used to justify too many tragedies in our history.
Starfleet doesn't want officers who will blindly follow orders without
analysing the situation. Your actions were appropriate for the
circumstances, and I have noted that in your record. <br>

TORAL: The Duras family will one day rule the Empire! <br>

your name and your honour from you. In return, I give his life to you. <br>
