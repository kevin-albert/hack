COMPUTER: The Cardassians are still closing. They have powered their
weapons systems. (swerve) They have established weapons lock. <br>
(Big swerve.) <br>
COMPUTER: Weapons lock broken. <br>
NOG: Going to warp. <br>
(Jake is knocking on the runabout window.) <br>
NOG: Get out of here, Jake. I'm in the middle of a simulation. <br>
JAKE: (mouths) What? <br>
NOG: I said, get out of here. Computer, end programme. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Holosuite]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Nog falls backwards.) <br>
JAKE: Oh, you okay? <br>
NOG: Look what you made me do. <br>
JAKE: Well you should know not to end a programme sitting down. <br>
NOG: Why did you come in here? <br>
JAKE: You were supposed to meet me half an hour ago. <br>
NOG: I didn't realise it'd gotten so late. Sorry. <br>
JAKE: Don't worry about it. How's it going, anyway? <br>
NOG: Pretty good. I've improved my reaction time by almost twenty
percent, but I've got to get it up another five. <br>
JAKE: Is that the cutoff point for getting into the Academy preparatory
programme? <br>
NOG: Exactly. <br>
JAKE: Don't worry about it, Nog. You'll get there. <br>
NOG: I'd better. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Quark's cafe]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOG: If I don't get into the programme, I'll never
be admitted to the Academy next year. <br>
JAKE: You think six weeks of summer classes'll make the difference? <br>
NOG: If I do well. I have to show the admissions committee how
determined I am to become a cadet. <br>
JAKE: Don't worry so much, Nog. You'll be a great cadet. <br>
QUARK: In the meantime, you make a lousy stock boy. Why can't you take
after your friend here? He knows enough to stay out of Starfleet. Even
a human can see that there are a lot more profitable opportunities out
there for a young man with ambition. <br>
NOG: Uncle, he wants to be a writer. There's no profit in that. <br>
QUARK: On the contrary. Writing holosuite programmes, especially the
more intimate variety, is very profitable. <br>
JAKE: I'll bet. <br>
QUARK: I'll tell you what. The two of you come up with a proposal, and
I'll put up the latinum for your first programme. <br>
NOG: I don't think so, Uncle. <br>
QUARK: All right, fine. Join Starfleet. I don't know why I bother
trying to help you, anyway. Go down to the storeroom and get your
father. Tell him to get behind the bar. Lieutenant Dax has asked me to
join the senior staff for a very important meeting in the wardroom.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: Do you have any idea what Dax wants to talk
to us about? <br>
ODO: No. <br>
BASHIR: Apparently she asked Leeta to come as well. <br>
ODO: I've noticed they've been spending quite a bit of time together. <br>
BASHIR: Do you keep tabs on everybody, Constable? <br>
ODO: Not everyone. But really, Doctor, two Delvin fluff pastries for
breakfast this morning? You of all people should know better than to
start your day like that. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Wardroom]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(General small talk going on.) <br>
BASHIR: Major. Chief. Hello, Leeta. <br>
LEETA: Oh, hello. <br>
BASHIR: How are you doing? <br>
ODO: And what does that mean, exactly? <br>
DAX: Thank you all for coming. <br>
BASHIR: No problem. <br>
DAX: I'll get right to the point. You are the seven people on this
station that I feel closest to, and I want you all to be a part of my
zhian'tara. <br>
QUARK: Zhian'tara? What's that? <br>
LEETA: It's the Trill Rite of Closure. I've read about it. <br>
DAX: The zhian'tara is a ritual where joined Trills get a chance to
actually meet their previous hosts. <br>
KIRA: Meet them? How? <br>
DAX: That's where you come in. If you don't mind, I'd like to borrow
your bodies for a few hours. <br>
O'BRIEN: What do you mean borrow our bodies? <br>
DAX: If you agree to participate, the memories of one of my previous
hosts will be temporarily removed from the symbiont and imprinted onto
you. You essentially become one of my hosts for the duration of the
ritual. <br>
BASHIR: And how is this accomplished? <br>
DAX: The memories are transferred telepathically by a Guardian. <br>
ODO: A Guardian? <br>
LEETA: They take care of the symbionts. Usually they're unjoined Trill.
<br>
BASHIR: Leeta is sort of an amateur sociologist. <br>
LEETA: It comes in handy in my line of work. You never know who you'll
meet at the dabo table. <br>
QUARK: You're asking me to hand my body over to some dead person? <br>
DAX: Oh, only for a few hours. <br>
QUARK: What happens to me in the meantime? <br>
DAX: You'll remain conscious of everything that's going on around you,
and at any time you can reassert yourself and regain control of your
body. <br>
SISKO: But it's best to you relax and let the host's memories emerge.
The point is to give Jadzia the chance to interact with her previous
hosts. Curzon spoke very fondly of his zhian'tara. He said it was one
of the most powerful experiences of his life. <br>
BASHIR: I do have one question. What about Joran? <br>
QUARK: Joran? Was he the crazy host of yours? The musician who killed
someone? <br>
DAX: Commander Sisko has volunteered to embody Joran. <br>
SISKO: We've already discussed taking certain precautions during the
transfer. <br>
BASHIR: Well, count me in. <br>
LEETA: Me, too. <br>
KIRA: Yes. <br>
ODO: Agreed. <br>
DAX: Chief? <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh. Yes. Yeah, I'm in. <br>
QUARK: Why is everybody looking at me? <br>
ODO: Because you're the only one who hasn't agreed to participate. <br>
QUARK: I'm sorry, Lieutenant. You're going to have to find someone
else. <br>
(Dax resorts to lobe stroking.) <br>
DAX: I really want you to be a part of this, Quark. I was hoping that
you'd embody Audrid for me. <br>
QUARK: Well. <br>
DAX: I think it'll make us closer. <br>
QUARK: When you put it that way. <br>
DAX: I knew I could count on you. Kira, I would like you to embody
Lela, my first host. We'll start tomorrow, after the Guardian arrives.
It means a lot to me that all of you all willing to do this. Thank you.
<br>
(Everyone leaves except Dax and Sisko.) <br>
SISKO: Correct me if I'm wrong, but did Quark just agree to embody one
of your female hosts? <br>
DAX: Yes, he did.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Holosuite]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: After that comes the deductive reasoning
portion of the exam, and then the spatial orientation test. The whole
thing should take about four days. Now I know it must sound
overwhelming to you. Just try to take it one day at a time. <br>
NOG: One day at a time. Right. <br>
O'BRIEN: And today, all you have to worry about is the stress reaction
test. Computer, run programme delta five nine.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Holosuite Ops]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOG: I thought this was going to be a runabout
simulation. <br>
O'BRIEN: No. <br>
NOG: But that's what I practised. <br>
O'BRIEN: If we tested you where you practised it wouldn't exactly be
stressful, now would it? Man your post. You're the Operations Officer
on duty. <br>
(Nog sits at a console and shudder! An alarm sounds.) <br>
NOG: What was that? <br>
O'BRIEN: You tell me.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Airlock]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GUARDIAN: We've been trying to get Dax back to the
homeworld to perform the zhian'tara for some time now. She kept putting
us off, so the Symbiosis Commission decided to force the issue and send
me here. <br>
DAX: I just haven't had time to get away. <br>
SISKO: You could've made the time. <br>
GUARDIAN: Where is the zhian'tara to take place? I have preparations to
make. <br>
DAX: This way. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Guest quarters]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(There's a flame burning in a cauldron.) <br>
GUARDIAN: I'nora, ja'kala Dax. Ahian'shee Lela tanus rem. Gon'dar
Jadzia tor. Jadzia, zhian'tara vok. Tu Dax, zhian'tani ress. Zhian'par,
Lela garu'koj. <br>
(He places his hands behind Kira and Dax's heads, and something flows
from Dax through him to Kira.) <br>
DAX: Kira? <br>
(Kira sounds more middle-aged, and carries her head forward.) <br>
LELA: No, Lela. You must be Dax's new host. <br>
DAX: I'm Jadzia. <br>
LELA: What a beautiful name. <br>
GUARDIAN: I have a few questions for both of you. I need to make sure
the memory transference is complete. <br>
LELA: Go ahead <br>
GUARDIAN: What is the last thing you remember? <br>
LELA: Talking to Curzon at his zhian'tara. <br>
GUARDIAN: Can you tell me the name of the person who supervised Lela
when she was an Initiate? <br>
DAX: No. I can't remember. <br>
GUARDIAN: That's perfectly all right. It just means Lela's memories
have been temporarily removed from your mind. <br>
DAX: It's a little disorienting, like part of me is suddenly missing. <br>
LELA: Not missing, right here. (her head) And the name of my Initiate
supervisor was Jobel. <br>
GUARDIAN: Excellent. The transference seems to be complete. Unless
either of you has any questions, I'll leave you alone for a few hours. <br>
LELA: Thank you. <br>
(Guardian leaves) <br>
LELA: Such odd fellows, these Guardians, huh? <br>
DAX: I know. <br>
LELA: Well, it's understandable, I suppose. They spend most of their
time underground tending symbiont pools full of this stuff. I love the
smell of it, don't you? It looks like you've ended up a long way from
home, Jadzia. What is it? <br>
DAX: It's just, I hold my hands behind my back the same way you do. <br>
LELA: It's a habit I picked up when I was a Legislator. I was one of
the first women to serve as a council member. When I started out, I
talked with my hands a lot. Lots of emphatic gesturing. I discovered
some of my male colleagues were imitating of me, so I started to do
this. <br>
DAX: I thought it was just an unconscious habit. I never realised why I
did it. <br>
LELA: That's the point of the zhian'tara, to discover these kinds of
things about yourself. <br>
DAX: It's so strange. It's like you really are Lela. <br>
LELA: Well in a sense, I am. After all, what is a person but a sum of
their memories? I have a feeling that these next few days are going to
be extraordinary for you. <br>
DAX: Tobin, I don't think Chief O'Brien is going to appreciate you
biting his nails. <br>
TOBIN: (nasal voice, American twang) Sorry. I guess I'm a little
nervous. <br>
DAX: That's all right. I get that way sometimes myself. <br>
TOBIN: Now you know who you have to thank for it. Sorry. <br>
DAX: Will you please stop saying you're sorry? <br>
TOBIN: Sorry. <br>
DAX: I've been working on finishing your proof of Fermat's last
theorem. <br>
TOBIN: You have? <br>
DAX: It's the most original approach to the proof since <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/199507/faltings.pdf"> Wiles</a>
over three hundred years ago. <br>
TOBIN: Thanks. <br>
DAX: I guess I tend to look for original approaches myself. I guess I
have you to thank for that, as well. <br>
(We switch to Leeta doing acrobatics.) <br>
DAX: Very nice. <br>
EMONY: This is an excellent body you've managed to get for me. <br>
DAX: I'll be sure to pass that on. <br>
EMONY: I remember when I first got the Dax symbiont, I was worried that
it might affect my coordination in some way. <br>
DAX: And hurt your gymnastics career? <br>
EMONY: As it turned out, being joined improved my concentration. <br>
DAX: Really? I found that as well. <br>
EMONY: You're a gymnast? <br>
DAX: No, but I'm an expert in Klingon martial arts. <br>
EMONY: Ah. Did you take it up before or after you were joined? <br>
DAX: After. <br>
EMONY: Why am I not surprised? <br>
AUDRID: Sit right here and I'll tell you all about it. <br>
(Quark starts brushing Dax's hair) <br>
AUDRID: The day I was named head of the Symbiosis Commission was one of
the happiest of my life. Right behind the day I gave birth to my first
child. Are you a mother, Jadzia? <br>
DAX: No. <br>
AUDRID: Oh, I hope you will be someday. There's nothing quite like
holding a baby to your breast, nursing it. The entity that lent me this
body wishes to speak. <br>
QUARK: How much longer am I going to have to do this? <br>
DAX: Another hour at most. And the sooner we get back to it, the sooner
it'll be over. <br>
QUARK: Just remember, not a word about this to anyone. <br>
DAX: I promise. <br>
(Dax reaches for another treat and someone takes a handful.) <br>
DAX: Maybe you should go easy on those, Torias. Julian was just telling
me the other day he's started to watch what he eats. <br>
(Brash, loud, sort of mid-west accent but not quite.) <br>
TORIAS: Well, you should tell your friend to live a little. Life's too
short to deprive yourself of the simple pleasures. I should know. <br>
DAX: You didn't exactly deprive yourself. <br>
TORIAS: No, but my life was too short. <br>
DAX: The accident. <br>
TORIAS: Still, I'm lucky. I continue to exist as part of you. Just as
Jadzia will go on existing when the symbiont is passed on to a new
host. We're part of something bigger than any one of us. I just feel
lucky to have been chosen. <br>
DAX: So do I. <br>
(Doorbell) <br>
TORIAS: Come in. <br>
GUARDIAN: It's late. I think it's time we returned Doctor Bashir's body
to him. <br>
DAX: It was nice meeting you. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: I'm ready. <br>
ODO: Are you sure about this, Commander? <br>
SISKO: Don't worry, Odo. Joran isn't going to be able to hurt anyone
from inside a holding cell. <br>
ODO: There's just one problem. You're going to be in there with him. </font></p>

DAX: Joran. <br>
JORAN: Hello, Jadzia. <br>
(Creepy Hannibal Lector character.) <br>
ODO: If you need me, I'll be right outside. <br>
GUARDIAN: As will I. <br>
JORAN: It's good to see you again, Jadzia. Tell me, have you been
practising your music? <br>
DAX: Yes, when I have the time. <br>
JORAN: Good. Do you think of me when you play? <br>
DAX: Sometimes. <br>
JORAN: I'm glad. You're a very pretty girl, Jadzia. Very pretty. But
unfortunately that's all you are. You're nothing compared to Lela,
Torias or myself. A pretender. You must realise that by now. <br>
DAX: You don't know anything about me. <br>
JORAN: Only what I can see. A little girl not worthy of the noble
creature nestled inside her. You're overwhelmed by it. You're in over
your head. And they said it was a mistake choosing me for joining. But
there is one hope for you, Jadzia, and that's me. My strength is within
you. You don't have to be afraid of it. <br>
DAX: I'm not. <br>
JORAN: Then use it let me show you how to use it. Lower the forcefield,
Jadzia. Lower it, and you will never be afraid of anything ever again. <br>
DAX: No. <br>
(Joran pushes against the forcefield with his hands, then starts
thumping his head against it.) <br>
DAX: Joran! Stop it, you're hurting him. Benjamin, take control! <br>
SISKO: I think that's enough of Jora
