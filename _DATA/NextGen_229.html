Captain's log, stardate 46071.6. We have been called to the aid of a
transport ship, which has been attacked near Rekag-Seronia. Hostilities
between the two factions on that planet have intensified recently,
threatening an important Federation shipping route.

DATA: The cruisers' weapons are powered up but sir, the Rekag ships are
turning and heading out of sensor range.<br>
RIKER: They don't want to take on the Enterprise.<br>

WORF: Aye, sir.<br>
PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation starship
Enterprise.<br>
TALMADGE [OC]: Captain Talmadge of the Dorian. Glad you're here we took
some shield damage from the Rekag ships but we're still intact.<br>
PICARD: Do you have injuries? Can we assist you in any way?<br>
TALMADGE [OC]: No injuries, but I'd like permission to transport a
couple of our passengers to your ship.<br>
PICARD: Of course.<br>
TALMADGE [OC]: We're conveying a mediator to Seronia. I think he's the
reason the Rekags fired on us. He's (breaks up) <br>

board. Counsellor, after you've seen to their needs will you escort
them to my Ready room.<br>

ALKAR: Ambassador Ves Alkar, and my mother, Sev Maylor. Counsellor,
it's imperative that I speak to the Captain. <br>
MAYLOR: You think he's attracted to you, but he isn't. You offer him
nothing.<br>
ALKAR: She hasn't been feeling well. Could she be taken to quarters?<br>
TROI: Of course. Chief. I'll take you to Captain Picard.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALKAR: I am grateful for the Federation's offer to
escort me, but if I arrive at Rekag-Seronia on board the Enterprise,
the armed flagship of Starfleet, my mission as negotiator of peace will
be compromised. There must be a Federation transport ship somewhere in
the area that could take me there.<br>
PICARD: With all due respect. Admiral, to put the Ambassador on board
another unarmed transport would be to invite a second assault.<br>
ALKAR: I believe the attack on us was an isolated incident, nothing
more.<br>
SIMONS [on monitor]: Ambassador Alkar, the Rekag-Seronia dispute has
threatened Federation ships for many months. We are grateful that you
are willing to undertake this mission and you have our full support.<br>
ALKAR: Thank you, sir.<br>
SIMONS [on monitor]: However, we also recognise that safety is an
issue. Not just yours, but the crew that escorts you. To send you on an
unarmed transport puts everyone at risk. I think it best if you proceed
to Rekag-Seronia aboard the Enterprise. <br>
ALKAR: Then I have no choice.<br>
SIMONS [on monitor]: Once you get to Rekag-Seronia, you can conduct
your negotiations as you see fit. Until then, you'll be in good hands
with Captain Picard.<br>
ALKAR: I understand, sir.<br>
SIMONS [on monitor]: Good luck, and a successful journey.<br>

TROI: The skills are demanding. You're very disciplined.<br>
ALKAR: I believe in a strong connection between body and mind. You
obviously share the same convictions.<br>
TROI: Yes, I do. Only sometimes my body has a problem conforming to my

ALKAR: I don't know about that. I think maybe my biggest asset is
patience. I let everybody else talk until they're exhausted, and when I
start, they're too tired to argue.<br>
TROI: You're going to need all your patience at Seronia. I can't
imagine how you'll get the two sides talking to each other. <br>

idea what you might be feeling just now.<br>

serenity, tranquillity. You seem to embody the very qualities that you
hope to draw out in others.

TROI: It might.<br>
RIKER: What's wrong?<br>
TROI: I've just had a disturbing encounter with Alkar's mother. She
frightens me, Will. The feelings I sense from her are malevolent.
They're out of proportion. They're evil.<br>
RIKER: I know she's been sick. She's very old. She's probably senile.
Who knows, we could all end up that way some day.<br>

TROI: Alkar, is there anything I can do? <br>
ALKAR: Counsellor, there's a funeral meditation. Part of our rituals.
As an empath, you're the only person on board who could perform it with
me.<br>
TROI: I'll be glad to help. <br>
(later - the room is darkened, and Alkar takes a pair of crystals from
a box) <br>

concerned. I haven't been able to determine the cause of death. She was
elderly. and Alkar said she had been ill, but I found no evidence of
any disease. I did find abnormally high levels of neurotransmitter
residue in her cerebral cortex.<br>
PICARD: What are you suggesting?<br>
CRUSHER: I'd like to do an autopsy. I've already spoken to Alkar, and
he informs me that Lumerian custom forbids it. Could you speak with him?<br>
PICARD: Do you suspect that her death poses some kind of threat to the
Enterprise?<br>

Rekag sympathisers in outlying districts have attacked several towns.<br>

JARTH: It was broken before it went into effect. A Rekag shuttle
strayed into Seronian space and was destroyed by fighter craft.<br>
LIVA: (a woman) Naturally, the Rekags retaliated. There's been fighting
ever since.<br>
ALKAR: If they would just sit down with me.<br>
JARTH: The Rekags won't go into Seronian territory for talks. And the
Seronians won't go to Rekag. In the meantime, they fight.<br>
PICARD: Ambassador, the situation sounds so volatile. Perhaps a cooling
off period? <br>
ALKAR: These people need an end to the fighting now. To delay a week,
even a few days, could cost thousands of lives.<br>
PICARD: Then I would recommend that we ask both sides if they would
agree to meet in the city of Darthen.<br>

PICARD: It's a coastal city that has been neutral throughout the
conflict. Both Seronians and Rekag loyalists live there. It might be
acceptable as a compromise.<br>

try, Counsellor, I try to make sure there's nothing he could find fault
with.<br>
TROI: Give me an example of what you mean.<br>
JANEWAY: Well, yesterday I was running routine diagnostics on the
sensor pallets. They checked out, but Lieutenant Pinder questioned me
because I'd allowed a point oh two three variance. That's well within
specifications. He goes out of his way to criticise me.<br>

you can't take it here, then you might think about a transport ship.

CRUSHER: It'll disappear in a day or two.<br>
OGAWA: Doctor Crusher? I think you should see these readings, Doctor.
Her neurotransmitter levels are three hundred percent above normal.<br>
CRUSHER: If you remember, I found extremely high levels of
neurotransmitter residue in Alkar's mother.<br>
PICARD: Could Deanna have picked up some kind of disease from her?<br>
CRUSHER: I don't know. I need to do that autopsy. I don't care about
the customs of Alkar's people. I need to find out if there's a
connection between what killed Maylor and what's happening to Troi.<br>
PICARD: Picard to Lieutenant Worf.<br>
WORF [OC]: Worf here, Captain.<br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, contact Ambassador Alkar. I need to speak with
him. <br>
OGAWA: Doctor, neural energy is now three hundred forty percent above
normal. <br>
WORF [OC]: Captain, Ambassador Alkar is at the negotiation table and
cannot be disturbed.<br>
PICARD: Proceed with the autopsy. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Medical log, stardate 46075.1. I have performed an
autopsy on Alkar's mother, but instead of answering our questions, the
results have created an even deeper mystery.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ready room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: I don't have any explanation for this.
When I examined Maylor's body, I found her heart, her lungs, her
skeletal structure, most of the systems in her body were those of a
thirty year old.<br>
PICARD: But how could that be? We both saw the woman.<br>
CRUSHER: That's not all. I compared Maylor and Alkar's DNA. I don't
know who that woman was, but she was definitely not his mother.
Deanna's condition is deteriorating rapidly. She could die. There are
questions that only Alkar can answer.<br>
PICARD: Picard to Lieutenant Worf.<br>
WORF [OC]: Worf here, Captain.<br>
PICARD: Meet me in Transporter room two. We're going down to the
surface.<br>
WORF [OC]: Aye, sir.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><b>[Conference chambers anteroom]</b></b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALKAR: No, she wasn't my mother.<br>
PICARD: And she wasn't ninety three years old.<br>
ALKAR: Captain, did you perform an autopsy against my wishes?<br>
PICARD: Yes, for a very good reason. Counsellor Deanna Troi is in
Sickbay, dying. Doctor Crusher doesn't know the cause of her condition,
but I believe you do.<br>
LIVA: Alkar, we need you. The Rekags have withdrawn some of their
concessions and the Seronians are threatening to break off the talks.<br>
ALKAR: I'll be right there.<br>
LIVA: But <br>
(Liva leaves) <br>
ALKAR: They've been arguing for hours in there. It seems hopeless. But
now, when expectations are lowest, now is the moment I can be most
effective. If I'm focused, centred, free of disquieting thoughts, I can
turn these factions toward peace. <br>
PICARD: Alkar<br>
ALKAR: Hear me out, Captain. It's important you understand. You see, I
discovered long ago I had the ability to channel my darker thoughts, my
unwanted emotions, to others, leaving me unencumbered.<br>
PICARD: Is this what you've done to Counsellor Troi?<br>
ALKAR: I hadn't planned it. I'd expected Maylor to live through the
negotiation. Her death could not have been more untimely.<br>
PICARD: So then you deliberately used Deanna.<br>
ALKAR: She's an empath. I was reasonably certain I could establish a
link with her. Frankly, I was amazed when I saw
how quickly she'd aged. Usually my receptacles survive for years.<br>
PICARD: Receptacles?<br>
ALKAR: Come now, Captain. Surely you can see there's a broader canvas
here. If I came to these peace talks hindered by unwanted emotions, the
Rekags and Seronians would be condemned to go on fighting <br>
PICARD: You cannot explain away a wantonly immoral act because you
think it is connected to some higher purpose.<br>
ALKAR: Captain. do you know how many people have died on this planet in
the last forty eight hours? Thousands. Deanna Troi is just one
individual.<br>
PICARD: That does not justify brutalising her, nor any of the others
you have used.<br>
ALKAR: Ask the Seronian and Rekag children who go to bed each night in
fear of their lives. Captain, I get no payment, I have no power base,
no agenda. I am willing to risk my life simply to help others.<br>
PICARD: Do you think that makes you appear courageous? Because you're
mistaken. You're a coward, Alkar. You exploit the innocent
because you're unwilling to shoulder the burdens of unpleasant
emotions. Well, this time you will be held accountable. I'm taking you
back to the Enterprise to release Counsellor Troi.<br>
ALKAR: I have no intention of releasing her now or ever.<br>
LIVA: Alkar, everything is falling apart. You have to come now.<br>
ALKAR: If you'll excuse me, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf. <br>
(Guards take Worf's phaser) <br>
ALKAR: I'm needed. <br>
LIVA: You and your Security Chief will leave.

PICARD: Lock on to Alkar's signal. Bring him on board.<br>
WORF: Captain, I am sure the Seronians have re-activated their security
field.<br>
PICARD: Then work with Mister La Forge to find a way to break through
it. I want that man on this ship.<br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: I'll be in Sickbay.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: If Alkar is flooding her with this psychic
waste, that would explain the high level of neurotransmitters.
All these negative emotions pouring into her have caused an abnormal
chemical response in her brain. <br>
RIKER: Isn't there something you can do to counteract it?<br>
CRUSHER: Enzymic decontaminants will be able to reduce the level of the
neurotransmitters, but I can't make any headway unless Alkar stops what
he's doing.<br>
PICARD: He has no intention of stopping. He feels perfectly justified
in using her until she dies.<br>
CRUSHER: Then Deanna has to die. In order to save Deanna, Alkar has to
break his link with her. And the only he'll do that is if she's no
longer an adequate receptacle. When Maylor died, Alkar turned
immediately to Deanna.<br>
PICARD: If Deanna dies, and he breaks the link with her, then he will
choose someone else, possibly someone from his own delegation.<br>
RIKER: Wait a minute. You're talking about killing Deanna! <br>
CRUSHER: I'll be able to resuscitate her, Will, as long as it's not
more than thirty minutes. The big question is, will that be enough
time? Alkar has to establish a link with someone else before we revive
Deanna, or else he might turn back to her.<br>
PICARD: We must bear in mind that we'll be putting his next victim at
risk. I want every possible security measure taken to protect that
person.<br>
RIKER: How will you? <br>
CRUSHER: I'll give her a hypospray of dylamadon. It's the gentlest way.<br>
PICARD: Proceed, Doctor.
