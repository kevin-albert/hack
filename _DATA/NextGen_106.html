Captain's log, Stardate 41263.1. We have rendezvoused with the USS
Fearless, from which a Starfleet propulsion expert and his assistant
are beaming over to conduct tests on the Enterprise's warp drive
engines. They have completed similar adjustments on two other Starfleet
vessels.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: I don't understand your concern, Number
One. They're not authorised to make any alterations in our engines, and
according to Starfleet's report, they will simply test different ways
of entering warp speed and different intermix formulas. What's the harm
in that? <br>
RIKER: It's the specs that Kosinski sent us. In my opinion, sir,
they're gibberish. <br>
PICARD: Gibberish? <br>
RIKER: Mister Data, would you explain? <br>
DATA: Sir, we put Mister Kosinski's specs into the computer and ran a
controlled test on them. There was no improvement in engine
performance. <br>
PICARD: Then how do you explain Starfleet's report that the same tests
on the USS Ajax and on the Fearless over there, resulted in a
measurable increase in propulsion. <br>
RIKER: Our engines are new, sir. Top condition. The tests on those
older ships may have simply been to straighten out some engine
inefficiency. <br>
CHIEF [OC]: Bridge from Transporter Chief. Two from USS Fearless are
ready to beam over. <br>
PICARD: Stand by for Commander Riker, Chief. He's on his way. <br>
CHIEF [OC]: Aye, sir, <br>
PICARD: Since you're concerned about these tests. <br>
RIKER: Yes, sir. Captain, if I may, I'll ask Counsellor Troi to look
these visitors over. <br>
PICARD: Very good. </font></p>

First Officer, Commander William Riker, and this is <br>
KOSINSKI: Where is the Captain, please? <br>
RIKER: He is engaged in other duties, sir. <br>
KOSINSKI: A ship's engines should be a concern of the ship's Captain. <br>
RIKER: They are, sir. Which is why they have made the First Officer
directly responsible for an engine's condition
and performance. Guided, of course, by one of our Chief Engineers,
Lieutenant Commander Argyle in this case. <br>
ARGYLE: A pleasure, sir. I appreciated receiving the specs. <br>
KOSINSKI: To which you have no end of questions? <br>
ARGYLE: Aye, I have. <br>
RIKER: And you, sir, are listed as <br>
TRAVELLER: As Mister Kosinski's assistant. My actual name is
unpronounceable by humans. <br>
RIKER: You're from Tau Alpha C. That's very distant. <br>
KOSINSKI: All approved and described in the Starfleet communications.
Now, I would like to set up in the Engine Room immediately. <br>
RIKER: I'll have our Chief Engineer show you to his Engine Room. <br>
KOSINSKI: No need. I know my way around starships. <br>
(He barges between Riker and Argyle and out into the corridor, followed
by his assistant, then Argyle) <br>
RIKER: One thing that Kosinski isn't hiding, his bad disposition. <br>
TROI: Agreed. Also, he's arrogant, overbearing, self-important, and
very sure of himself and his ability. <br>
RIKER: And the other one, his assistant? <br>
TROI: He's the puzzle. With most life forms I can usually feel
something. I may not be able to understand or interpret it, but I feel
something, if only a presence. With him, nothing. Empty space. It's as
though he isn't even here. Something about this concerns me. I don't
know what, I can't point out a reason yet. <br>
RIKER: Stay concerned, please. The safety of the Enterprise may be
entrusted to these two.

entourage in tow) <br>
KOSINSKI: Inform the Bridge I shall begin the first test in precisely
fifteen minutes. Why is that child here? <br>
(Wesley is at an ancillary station) <br>
ARGYLE: He's working on a school project. Before you begin, there are
some questions. First, tell us how you arrived <br>
KOSINSKI: In order to save myself time, let me ask those questions for
you. You received the information which Starfleet provided, you fed it
into your computer as precisely as humanly possible, then you did a
controlled test. And then, to your astonishment, nothing happened. So
you said, what's going on? This doesn't work. Kosinski's a fraud. You
see, I have had this conversation on other Starfleet vessels before.
They didn't understand it. why should you? <br>
(Meanwhile, the Traveller is interested in what Wesley is doing,
looking over his shoulder) <br>
ARGYLE: Surely you're not saying it's unexplainable? <br>
KOSINSKI: I'm saying I'm not a teacher, nor do I wish to become one. I
have neither the inclination nor the time. <br>
RIKER: You have all the time you need. <br>
KOSINSKI: I don't think you understand. This has already been approved
by Starfleet Command. <br>
RIKER: But it hasn't been approved by the Chief Engineer or by me. <br>
KOSINSKI: I didn't know that was necessary. <br>
RIKER: Now you do. <br>
KOSINSKI: Perhaps I should speak to Captain Picard. <br>
RIKER: If you like. It won't change anything. <br>
KOSINSKI: How basic shall I be? <br>
RIKER: I'll leave that to you. <br>
(They go over to the big multi-station console in the middle of the
room) <br>
KOSINSKI: Would you get onto the auxiliary panel, please? <br>
(Wesley gives up his console to the Traveller) <br>
KOSINSKI: In order to save time, my assistant is going to lay in my
base formulas more rapidly than any human being possibly could,
including even myself. So, here then, in the simplest possible terms,
what I do. Now, this warp drive system was tuned only in the grossest
possible sense, at least according to my standards. What I do is
specific. Thank you. Well, sufficient to say for now, these symbols
(continues under Wesley and Traveller's whispered conversation) <br>
TRAVELLER: Something troubles you with the way this is configured? How
about it now? <br>
WESLEY: Yes. But shouldn't these be connected? Here and here. <br>
TRAVELLER: Now will it do what Kosinski says it will? <br>
WESLEY: It has a chance. It might work better this way. Yes. <br>
(The Traveller is impressed with Wesley) <br>
KOSINSKI: View with me if you will this screen as we consider the
following. Now, is this merely mechanics or is it nature that we deal
with in all of this? And what else than nature are the elementals of
space and time? You are trained in the system. You go in a straight
line, competent, yes, and perhaps even innovative in a minimalist way,
but what I do here is not the end of the process, it is the beginning.
So, what do I do? Go back to the Fearless, which I left with a more
efficient warp drive than I found? Or do you cast off your ignorance
and allow me to continue? <br>
RIKER: Could anything he's proposing damage our system? <br>
ARGYLE: How could it? It's meaningless. <br>
RIKER: Then we should let him try it? <br>
KOSINSKI: What do you mean, let he him try it? Don't talk about me in
the third person like I'm not standing right here! <br>
ARGYLE: Yes, we might as well let him try it. <br>
KOSINSKI: Oh yes, we might as well let him try it. You are too
generous. Boy! Boy, don't play with that.

left our own galaxy, but passed through
two others, ending up on the far side of Triangulum. The galaxy known
as M Thirty Three. <br>
PICARD: That's not possible. Data, what distance have we travelled? <br>
DATA: Two million seven hundred thousand light years. <br>
PICARD: I can't accept that. <br>

galaxy, past another, taking us over two million seven hundred thousand
light years in a few minutes.

incredible mistake. <br>
PICARD: Just explain what brought us here. <br>
KOSINSKI: As the power grew, I applied the energy asymptomatically. I
anticipated some tilling, but it didn't occur. Now that was my error,
using the Bessel functions at the beginning. <br>

KOSINSKI: Why not? Yes, of course. Since I'm the one who has made the
so-called warp barrier meaningless. And, Captain, this must be a
special thrill for you. <br>
PICARD: Thrill? <br>
KOSINSKI: As an explorer. In three centuries of space flight, we've
charted just eleven percent of our galaxy. And then we accomplish this.

us home? <br>

can't get us back, who will? <br>

for study? There is a giant protostar here in the process of forming.
No other vessel has been out this far. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Crusher is tending the Traveller) <br>
PICARD: Cause? <br>
CRUSHER: I don't know. My equipment doesn't register his kind of life
signs. I would have to guess exhaustion, fatigue. <br>
WESLEY: Is he going to be all right? <br>
PICARD: What is the boy doing here? <br>
WESLEY: Mom, he's my friend. <br>
RIKER: You may want him here before we're done, sir. He seems to have
developed some sort of special attachment to the boy. <br>
WESLEY: My name is Wesley, Commander Riker. <br>
PICARD: He knows. We all know. Will he live? <br>
CRUSHER: I'm not sure. <br>
PICARD: Wake him. <br>
CRUSHER: I recommend we let him come around in his own time. <br>
PICARD: We don't have that luxury. Wake him. <br>
CRUSHER: He could die, and with him any chance we have. <br>
PICARD: Doctor. Wes. We all have other friends aboard this ship, too.
If we stay here much longer we may lose the ability to distinguish
between thought and reality. Now, regardless of the risk, wake him.
Now. <br>
(Crusher gives the Traveller an injection) <br>
PICARD: Do you recognise me? I'm the Captain and I need answers. <br>
TRAVELLER: I'll do my best to provide <br>
PICARD: Who are you? Or what? <br>
TRAVELLER: I am a Traveller. <br>
PICARD: Traveller? What is your destination? <br>
TRAVELLER: Destination? <br>
PICARD: Yes, what place are you trying to reach? <br>
TRAVELLER: Ah, place. No. There is no specific place I wish to go. <br>
PICARD: Then what is the purpose of your journey? <br>
TRAVELLER: Curiosity. <br>
PICARD: That's not an answer. <br>
TRAVELLER: I have certain abilities. They give me an understanding of
propulsion. I've been trading this for passage on Starfleet vessels. <br>
RIKER: And allowing Kosinski to take credit for what you did. <br>
TRAVELLER: It seemed the sensible way. <br>
PICARD: Until now. <br>
TRAVELLER: Captain, I seek only transportation in order to see and
experience your reality. I am no a threat to you, your ship or your
crew. <br>
WESLEY: He isn't, Captain. I know he isn't. <br>
PICARD: Our reality? And in order to satisfy this curiosity, you have
brought my ship and my crew into great risk. <br>
TRAVELLER: I have made some mistakes. <br>
PICARD: Some mistakes? What mistakes could possibly explain these
incredible explosions of velocity? <br>
TRAVELLER: I don't know if I can put this in terms you'll understand. <br>
PICARD: I believe there may be a warp speed that can get us beyond
Galaxy M Thirty Three, but there is no velocity of any magnitude that
can possibly bring us wherever this is. Is it true what our navigation
sensors are telling us? Are we millions of light years away from where
we were? <br>
TRAVELLER: Well, yes. <br>
PICARD: Well, what got us here? <br>
TRAVELLER: Thought. <br>
PICARD: Thought? <br>
TRAVELLER: You do understand, don't you that thought is the basis of
all reality? The energy of thought, to put it in your terms, is very
powerful. <br>
KOSINSKI: That's not an explanation. <br>
TRAVELLER: I have the ability to act like a lens which focuses thought.
<br>
KOSINSKI: That's just so much nonsense. You're asking us to believe in
magic. <br>
TRAVELLER: Well yes, this could seem like magic to you. <br>
PICARD: No. No, it actually makes sense to me. Only the power of
thought could explain what has been happening. Especially out here. <br>
TRAVELLER: Thought is the essence of where you are now. You do
understand the danger, don't you? <br>
PICARD: Chaos. What we think is what happens. <br>
TRAVELLER: It pains me I was so careless, Captain. My intent was only
to observe, not to cause this. You should not be here until your far,
far distant future. Certainly not until you have learned control. <br>
RIKER: You are from a different time, aren't you? <br>
TRAVELLER: Well, no, not exactly from another time. Although as you
understand the concept, yes, perhaps that term fits as well as any. <br>
RIKER: And you have this ability to travel. <br>
TRAVELLER: Yes. <br>
RIKER: And others of your kind have the same ability? <br>
TRAVELLER: Yes. <br>
RIKER: Then why, in all of our history, is there no record of you or
someone like you ever having visited us? <br>
TRAVELLER: What wonderful arrogance. There is no record because we have
not visited you before. <br>
RIKER: Why not? <br>
TRAVELLER: Well, up until now, if you'll forgive this, you've been
uninteresting. It's only now that your life form merits serious
attention. I'm sorry. <br>
PICARD: What's happening? <br>
CRUSHER: He's unconscious again. <br>
PICARD: Revive him. <br>
CRUSHER: Whatever you need from him, you'd better get it soon. <br>
RIKER: If I may suggest, sir, that first leap out of our galaxy was, as
he said, a mistake. <br>
PICARD: Unless he was distracted by something. <br>
RIKER: And it weakened him, in some way leading to the incredible leap
out here. <br>
KOSINSKI: Theory! <br>
PICARD: Do you have any facts that fit this? Can you get us back? <br>
KOSINSKI: Wait, Captain, not so fast. We have an opportunity here for
scientific discovery. <br>
PICARD: And we report our observations how? To whom? (to the Traveller)
Can you get us back? <br>
TRAVELLER: I will try. <br>
PICARD: Number One, take him down to main Engineering. I'll be on the
Bridge. <br>
WESLEY: No! He's very weak. TRAVELLER: The Captain's right. We must
hurry. But first, I request a moment with the Captain. Alone. <br>
(Riker, Kosinski, Crusher and Wesley leave) <br>
PICARD: Strange how he seems to care for you. <br>
TRAVELLER: He will forget me in time, which is as it should be. It's
Wesley I wanted to speak to you about. <br>
PICARD: The boy? <br>
TRAVELLER: It's best you do not repeat this to the others, especially
not to the mother. Whatever may happen, it is imperative that it
proceed naturally. <br>
PICARD: I must get my ship back. Do we have time for this? <br>
TRAVELLER: Oh, yes. He and a few like him are why I travel. You have it
in your power to encourage him without interfering. <br>
PICARD: Encourage him in what? <br>
TRAVELLER: How shall I explain? Are you familiar with the intricacies
of what is called here music? <br>
PICARD: Somewhat. <br>
TRAVELLER: Such musical genius I saw in one of your ship's libraries.
One called Mozart, who as a small child wrote astonishing symphonies. A
genius who made music not only to be heard, but seen and felt beyond
the understanding, the ability of others. Wesley is such a person. Not
with music, but with the equally lovely intricacies of time, energy,
propulsion. and the instruments of this vessel which allow all that to
be played. You're right, I must hurry now. But you're right in
something else. He is just a boy for now. He should be encouraged, but
told none of this. <br>

have no choice but to repeat the same warp experiment. but wish one
variation. A principal part of this warp formula will be the thoughts
of everyone aboard the Enterprise. We have no idea exactly how this
works. We understand only that the Traveller makes use of this somehow.
It will be most important that those aboard avoid random thoughts that
might change

the Traveller's hand. Then the Traveller has a go at phasing.

PICARD: Please don't interrupt me, Wesley. <br>
WESLEY: I'm sorry, sir. <br>

PICARD: Well, then, I'll have to make him an acting ensign. Captain's
log, stardate 41263.4. For outstanding performance in the best of
Starfleet tradition, Wesley Crusher is made Acting Ensign, with the
duties and privileges of that rank. And whether that rank becomes
permanent, Mister Crusher, depends on you. At the earliest opportunity,
your entrance application for Starfleet Academy will be tendered. Until
then, you will learn this ship. Every operation, every function.

her later. </font></p>
