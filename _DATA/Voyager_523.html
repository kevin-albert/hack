JANEWAY: I wasn't expecting a pop quiz. <br>

There's still some work to be done, but once the sawdust clears, I think

not to risk exposure until he has to. <br>

even in a ship as quick and smart as Voyager. I've heard about a pilot
who might make the job easier. <br>

being for over two centuries. Unlikely. <br>
SEVEN: Human physiology is imperfect, susceptible to a variety of
disorders. <br>

suffering from a mild case of sensory aphasia. A minor disruption to
your neuro-receptors. Neither rare, nor life-threatening. <br>

Welcome back. <br>

Braxton. This is Lieutenant Ducane. You're aboard the Federation
Timeship Relativity. <br>
SEVEN: I'm no longer in the twenty fourth century? <br>
BRAXTON: No. For you, it's almost five hundred years later. We've
brought you here to help us solve a mystery. Someone, we don't know
who, has planted a weapon aboard Voyager. It's designed to fracture
space-time within a radius of one hundred and fifty metres. <br>
SEVEN: Why do you need me? <br>
DUCANE: Your ocular implant. It can detect disruptions in space-time
better than our sensors. <br>
BRAXTON: You're more familiar with Voyager and her crew, less likely to
arouse suspicion. So far, you've been quite useful. <br>
SEVEN: So far? <br>
BRAXTON: We've recruited you twice before for this mission. Take a
look. A force three temporal disrupter. Your previous attempts to
disable it have been unsuccessful. <br>
DUCANE: We're trying to catch the saboteur before he places the weapon
on Voyager. <br>
SEVEN: Do you have a suspect? <br>
DUCANE: Not yet. <br>
SEVEN: Do you know when the device was placed? <br>
DUCANE: Not precisely, but we've narrowed the window to a period two
years before you joined the crew, when the ship was under attack. <br>
SEVEN: Species three two nine, the Kazon. <br>
DUCANE: Our database indicates Voyager was boarded twice during that
period. <br>
SEVEN: The Kazon are an inferior species. They don't possess the
technology to create such a complex weapon. <br>
DUCANE: We believe the saboteur infiltrated this time frame because
Voyager's shields were down. It was the perfect opportunity to evade
the detection. <br>
SEVEN: If I fail, you will recruit me again. <br>
BRAXTON: If necessary. This'll be the third time you're going to be
removed from your time frame. If we do it a fourth, there could be
certain side effects. <br>
SEVEN: Side effects? <br>
DUCANE: You might experience sensory aphasia. It affects the cerebral
cortex and can lead to temporal psychosis. <br>

BRAXTON: When you're finished here, meet me in holomatrix one. I've
prepared a simulation. <br>(Later.)<br></rb>DUCANE:
Let's see how much you've assimilated. The Dali paradox. <br>
SEVEN: Also known as the Melting Clock Effect. It refers to a temporal
fissure which slows the passage of time to a gradual halt. <br>
DUCANE: The Pogo Paradox. <br>
SEVEN: A causality loop in which interference to prevent an event
actually triggers the same event. <br>
DUCANE: Excellent. Can you give me an example? <br>
SEVEN: The Borg once travelled back in time to stop Zefram Cochrane
from breaking the warp barrier. They succeeded, but that in turn led
the starship Enterprise to intervene. They assisted Cochrane with the
flight the Borg was trying to prevent. Causal loop complete. <br>
DUCANE: So, in a way, the Federation owes its existence to the Borg. <br>
SEVEN: You're welcome. The Seven of Nine paradox. <br>
DUCANE: I beg your pardon? <br>
SEVEN: How we do know that my presence on Voyager will not alter the
timeline? <br>
DUCANE: You know, you've asked me this every time. <br>
SEVEN: What's been your response? <br>
DUCANE: That uncertainty is part of the equation. We don't know what's
going to happen. <br>
SEVEN: I don't enjoy uncertainty. <br>
DUCANE: Neither do I. But I trust Captain Braxton's instincts, just as
you trust Captain Janeway's.

SEVEN: How will I disarm it? <br>

doesn't belong, especially when it comes to time travel. <br>
SEVEN: Captain Janeway is quite resourceful. Has it occurred to you
that she may be helpful? <br>
BRAXTON: Helpful? That woman has been responsible for three major
temporal incursions. <br>
SEVEN: No doubt creating numerous paradoxes. <br>
BRAXTON: And who do you think had to repair the damage? Me. She's
reckless. She has no regard for the integrity of the timeline. I asked
for her help once. She refused and I ended up stranded in the late
twentieth century. Have you ever been to that time frame? <br>

Incursion factor point zero zero three six. It's better than I
expected. <br>
JANEWAY: Glad we could lend a hand. When do we go home? <br>
DUCANE: You'll both be returned to your time frame. You'll be
reintegrated with the other Seven of Nine. Since none of your time
jumps were to your foreseeable future, only the past, I see no reason
to resequence your memory engrams. But remember the Temporal Prime
Directive. Discuss your experiences with no one. <br>
JANEWAY: Understood. <br>
DUCANE: Oh, Captain. Braxton was right about one thing. Voyager shows
up on our sensors far too often. Try to avoid time travel. <br>
JANEWAY: See you in the twenty fourth century. <br>
SEVEN: I look forward to it, or should I say, backward? <br>
JANEWAY: Don't get started. </font> </p>
