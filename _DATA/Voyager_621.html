<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(A saurian runs along a mine tunnel.)<br>MINER 1:
You're late. <br>
MINER 2: There was a problem with the pulse drills on level four. <br>
MINER 1: They're going to be here any moment. I want to make a good
impression. <br>
MINER 2: You're certain we should be doing this? <br>
MINER 1: Orek will be pleased that we took the initiative. <br>
MINER 2: I hope you're right. <br>(Two figures in Starfleet uniforms beam in.)<br>
MINER 1: Welcome to Telsius.<br>
DALA: Thank you. I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway. This is Commander Tuvok.
We're from the Federation Starship Voyager. <br>(The
resemblances are close, but not quite right. Janeway's hair is too
think, Tuvok is too stocky and the comm. badges are much bigger.)<br>DALA:&nbsp;We have several mines like
this on Earth. <br>
MINER 1: I'm not familiar with Earth. <br>
DALA: Thatâ€™s because it's thirty thousand light years from here. <br>
MOBAR: Thirty thousand three hundred forty two point four to be exact.<br>
MINER 1: You're a long way from home. <br>
DALA: It's difficult sometimes, then I close my eyes and think of the
farm in Indiana where I grew up. For a moment I'm home again. Shall
we get down to business? <br>
MINER 1: Yes. We've had a shortage of dilithium for the last two
months. If we can't replenish our supply we may be forced to suspend
work. <br>
MINER 2: Our chief of mining operations has gone to the Grenna system. <br>
MINER 1: Yes, but we are authorised to conduct trades in his absence. <br>
MOBAR: What are you prepared to trade? <br>
MINER 1: I'm afraid the only commodity we have is, er, bolomite. <br>
DALA: We really don't have much use for that. <br>
MOBAR: On the contrary, Captain. Bolomite is used in omega radiation
therapy. The orphans on Narva<br>
MINER 1: Orphans?<br>
MOBAR: The settlers on the Narva colony were exposed to toxic levels of
omega radiation. The entire adult population was killed. <br>
DALA: We're doing all we can for the children. All right, twenty
kilotons of dilithium for an equivalent amount of bolomite. <br>
MINER 1: We only have ten kilotons left. <br>
DALA: Then ten it is. <br>
MOBAR: Captain, I must point out that dilithium is worth nearly twice
as much as bolomite. <br>
DALA: Tuvok, these people need our help. I'm not going to quibble over
a few tons of ore. <br>
MINER 2: Perhaps we should celebrate. <br>
DALA: I wish we could, but there's a neutronic storm approaching our
ship. We should be leaving orbit. <br>
MINER 1: Give us an hour to finalise the arrangements. <br>
DALA: We'll be waiting to hear from you. <br>
MOBAR: Before we leave, would it be possible to tour your facility?
It's our duty as Starfleet officers <br>
DALA: Unfortunately the storm won't wait. Maybe on our next visit. <br>(Mobar gives the Vulcan salute.)<br>
MOBAR: Live long and prosper. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(An ugly, boxy thing. Part of the
interior is like Voyager's bridge, mostly the Captain's chair. There is
the UFP symbol on a wall panel behind it.)<br>DALA:
Ugh! This hair is so uncomfortable. <br>(She removes the wig.)<br>
MOBAR: I find it aesthetically pleasing. <br>
ZAR: The negotiations?<br>
DALA: It would've been perfect if Tuvok hadn't decided to improvise. <br>
MOBAR: I was portraying my character as truthfully as possible. <br>
DALA: Once we finish a transaction, we leave. Is that clear? <br>
MOBAR: Indeed. <br>
ZAR: Incoming transmission for Captain Janeway. <br>
DALA: Ready. This is Captain Janeway. <br>
MINER 1 [on viewscreen]: The bolomite is ready for transport. We thank
you for your generosity. <br>
DALA: Directive nine twenty seven of the Starfleet General Order.
Always help those in need. <br>
ZAR: Transport complete. <br>
DALA: We've enjoyed meeting you, gentlemen. <br>
MINER 1 [on viewscreen]: Er, Captain,&nbsp;we haven't received the
dilithium yet. <br>
DALA: Oh, the neutronic storm seems to be interfering with our
transporters. If we don't leave orbit immediately, we will sustain heavy
damage. <br>
MINER 2 [on viewscreen]: What about our d
