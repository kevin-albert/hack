DATA: Captain. Doctor. I am honoured by your presence, but may I
suggest you attend the second concert. <br>
CRUSHER: Why, Data? <br>
DATA: Ensign Ortiz will perform the violin part. My rendition will be
less enjoyable. <br>
PICARD: Oh? <br>
DATA: Although I am technically proficient, according to my fellow
performers, I lack soul. <br>
CRUSHER: Data, telling us why you're going to fail before you make the
attempt is never wise. <br>
DATA: But is not honesty always the preferred choice? <br>
PICARD: Excessive honesty can be disastrous, particularly in a
commander. <br>
DATA: Indeed? <br>
PICARD: Knowing your limitations is one thing. Advertising them to a
crew can damage your credibility as a leader. <br>
DATA: Because you will lose their confidence? <br>
CRUSHER: And you may begin to believe in those limitations yourself. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: Origin point of the message confirmed, sir.
It is from the Shelia star system. <br>
RIKER: The Sheliak have not attempted to communicate with the
Federation for a hundred and eleven years. Why are they doing it now? <br>
PICARD: On screen. <br>
(Not a person, but a computer record of a treaty and it's translation) <br>
SHELIAK [OC]:: Federation creatures, there are humans on the fifth
planet of Tau Cygna. This planet was ceded to the Corporate in section
one hundred and thirty-three, paragraph seventy seven of the Treaty of
Armens. We will begin
settlement of this world in four days. Remove the humans. <br>
PICARD: What the devil? <br>
SHELIAK [OC]: Federation creatures, there are humans on the fifth
planet <br>
PICARD: Cancel message. <br>
RIKER: Tau Cygna Five is in the de Laure Belt. Heavy concentrations of
hyperonic radiation. <br>
PICARD: Humans can't survive in that environment. Exposure to hyperonic
radiation is fatal. <br>
RIKER: Then the Sheliak are asking us to chase ghosts. <br>
PICARD: No, Number One. The Sheliak haven't broken a century of silence
to send us after phantoms. An investigation is in order. Set course for
Tau Cygna Five. <br>
(In orbit of the orange-brown planet) <br>
WORF: Captain, human life form readings from the planet. <br>
RIKER: So the Sheliak weren't hallucinating. <br>
PICARD: Numbers? <br>
WORF: Impossible to get an accurate reading. High levels of radiation
are disrupting our sensors. <br>
DATA: Hyperonic radiation also interferes with ship's transporters.
They are now inoperable. <br>
WORF: So are the ship's phasers. <br>
RIKER: How can humans survive down there? <br>
CRUSHER: They must have found a way to adapt. Milan's work with
radiation sensitivity suggests it is possible. Perhaps with extensive
viral therapy. <br>
PICARD: Well, whoever they are, and however they survived, we've got to
get them off the planet. <br>
RIKER: By treaty, that world still belongs to the Sheliak. <br>
PICARD: Who are within their rights to demand the removal of these
trespassers. <br>
RIKER: And if we don't remove them, the Sheliak will. Forcefully. <br>
CRUSHER: How forcefully? <br>
RIKER: The Sheliak consider humans a lower life form. They would have
no compunctions about exterminating the intruders. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, as you are unaffected by hyperonic radiation, I'd
like you to go to the planet via shuttlecraft and commence evacuation
procedures. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
PICARD: Number One, any speculation on what we might find down there? <br>
RIKER: My guess would be a lone survey ship. Maybe a dozen or so
survivors.

HARITATH: Look at the markings. It must be from the Federation. <br>

you don't want to waste time talking to us. <br>
KENTOR: You want to speak to Gosheven. We'll take you to him. <br>

you see all we've accomplished. <br>

DATA: Lieutenant Commander Data of the Starship Enterprise. <br>
KENTOR: He's an android. <br>
GOSHEVEN: So he is. Well, now that you're here, what do you want? <br>
DATA: My mission is to prepare this colony for evacuation. <br>
GOSHEVEN: Why? <br>
DATA: Because this planet belongs to the Sheliak. <br>
GOSHEVEN: And who is this Sheliak? <br>
DATA: The term is plural. The Sheliak are a non-humanoid, intelligent
life form, classification R3. <br>
GOSHEVEN: Well, this colony's been here over ninety years. We've never
seen a Sheliak. I'd say that makes Tau Cygna Five our planet. <br>
DATA: The original destination of the Artemis was Septimus Minor. <br>
GOSHEVEN: The guidance system on the Artemis failed. Took them off
course. Far off course. Our ancestors were lucky to find any place to
land. <br>
HARITATH: And when they did, the radiation started killing them. <br>
GOSHEVEN: Hyperonic radiation took the lives of a third of the
colonists before they learned they could adapt to it. <br>
KENTOR: But our colony survived and prospered. <br>
GOSHEVEN: Look around. We have brought water to the desert, built a
community. <br>
DATA: Your accomplishments are truly remarkable. Yet the Sheliak and
the Federation have a treaty which clearly makes this planet Sheliak
domain. <br>
GOSHEVEN: Then change the treaty. <br>
DATA: That may not be possible. The Sheliak wish to colonise this
planet, and are unwilling to share it with humans. If you are still
here when the Sheliak colony ship arrives, they will eradicate you. <br>
HARITATH: They'd kill all of us? <br>
DATA: They have little regard for human life. Thus, the most sensible
course is to prepare a contingency plan for the evacuation of your
people. <br>
GOSHEVEN: We're not evacuating. <br>
DATA: Perhaps I have not made myself clear. <br>
GOSHEVEN: Yes, you have. Let me be equally clear. There's going to be
no evacuation. You've delivered your message, so go back to your ship.
I have work to do. <br>
(Gosheven goes back to his discussion and an object is thrown at Data.
He catches it) <br>
ARD'RIAN: Nice catch. Wonderful reflexes. Sorry to test you like that,
but I was curious. <br>

GOSHEVEN: Found a new toy, have we, Ardi? <br>
ARD'RIAN: Toy? This is the most incredible android I've ever seen. <br>
DATA: Have you seen many? <br>
ARD'RIAN: Actually, no. You're the first. <br>
GOSHEVEN: Only you would get this excited over a walking calculator. <br>
ARD'RIAN: Cybernetic intelligence fascinates me. Are your neural
pathways duotronic? <br>
DATA: No, positronic. <br>
ARD'RIAN: I didn't know that was possible! What's your memory capacity?
How many operations per second? I have a million questions. <br>

speak for all of us. I see no reason to die needlessly. <br>
DATA: And you? <br>
KENTOR: I'm not sure. Gosheven's done well for us, but I'd like to hear
more of what you have to say. <br>
HARITATH: There are many others that feel the same way but they're very
uneasy about confronting Gosheven. <br>
ARD'RIAN: Get them together and we'll meet at my house.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TROI: In our dealings with other non-humanoid races
there has been some point of reference. Not so with the Sheliak. <br>
PICARD: But we must have something in common. We communicate. <br>
TROI: Barely. They have learned several Federation languages, but
theirs continues to elude us. <br>
PICARD: Telepaths? <br>
TROI: Attempted and failed. Actually, the fact that any alien race
communicates with another is quite remarkable. We are stranded on a
planet. We have no language in common, but I want to teach you mine.
(she hold up his cup of tea) S'smarith. What did I just say? <br>
PICARD: Cup? Glass? <br>
TROI: Are you sure? I may have meant liquid, clear, brown, hot. We
conceptualise the universe in relatively the same way. <br>
PICARD: Point taken. <br>
TROI: In your talks, you must be extremely accurate. The treaty is five
hundred thousand words. The length was to accommodate the Sheliak. They
consider our language irrational, and demanded this level of complexity
to avoid any future misunderstandings. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Captain, we have the vessel carrying the Sheliak colonists
on visual. <br>
PICARD: On my way. So, it begins.

ARD'RIAN: Kentor, are you with us? <br>
KENTOR: Yes. The question is, how do we convince Gosheven? <br>
HARITATH: Why do we need to? <br>
KENTOR: Because he's respected. Most people will do what he says. <br>
ARD'RIAN: They respect you, too. If you take a stand, they'll fall in
line. <br>
KENTOR: I don't know. Gosheven's got a lot of supporters. <br>
GOSHEVEN: Don't forget that, Kentor. I'm disappointed. I thought we'd
settled this. <br>

GOSHEVEN: Still stirring up trouble? <br>
ARD'RIAN: Since when is talk trouble? <br>
GOSHEVEN: It's over. Don't you get it? You had your say. You lost. <br>

GOSHEVEN: No, you're not. You're just stubborn. Well, let me tell you
something. <br>

GOSHEVEN: So am I. <br>
ARD'RIAN: Damn you, Gosheven. <br>

GOSHEVEN: I've killed no one. I merely shut down a machine. That's it,

SHELIAK: Advance and speak. <br>
PICARD: Director, we will comply with your request to remove the colony
from Tau Cygna Five, but we need time. <br>
SHELIAK: The given time has elapsed. We carry the membership and we
will proceed with their debarkation. <br>
TROI: The temporary presence of these humans should not interfere with
your plans. <br>
SHELIAK: Unacceptable. You must remove the creatures. <br>
PICARD: I'm trying, but the needed ship will not be available for three
weeks. <br>
SHELIAK: Then you are in violation. <br>
PICARD: I have admitted that. I am only asking for a little
flexibility. <br>
SHELIAK: Section five hundred and one, paragraph seven hundred and
sixteen, subparagraph five. Unwanted lifeforms inhabiting H class
worlds may be removed at the discretion of the Sheliak Corporate. <br>
PICARD: We will remove them, but you must grant us the time we require.
<br>

ARD'RIAN: I'm not surprised at Gosheven's behaviour. But Kentor and the
others, they said they were with us. I guess words don't mean very
much. <br>
DATA: Perhaps that is a part of our difficulty. Words are all we have
been using. Humans seem to take much stronger notice of actions. I
require a phaser. <br>
ARD'RIAN: What's a phaser? <br>
DATA: A type of weapon. Unfortunately it does not function in the
presence of hyperonic radiation. I will have to be innovative.

DATA: Hyperonic radiation randomises phaser beams. But I believe I can
improvise a servocircuit which will compensate by continuously
recollimating the output. <br>
ARD'RIAN: You're using your own neural subprocessors to build a smarter
phaser. <br>
DATA: Essentially correct. Get word to Gosheven. Tell him I am coming
to the pumping station. Tell him I am going to destroy the aqueduct. <br>
