<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Birds singing, brightly covered moss on
the trees. Precocious Miss Wildman hurries through her holonovel to a
raised pond with crazy paving surround and throws a pebble in amongst
the water lilies.)<br>FLOTTER
[OC]: Ouch! <br>
NAOMI: Wake up. <br>
FLOTTER [OC}: Who's there? <br>
NAOMI: Naomi. <br>
FLOTTER [OC]: Come back later. <br>
NAOMI: You know what I think? I think you're scared of the tree
monster. <br>(A fountain appears, and solidifies into a blue person with scales on his body.)<br>
FLOTTER: I'm not scared of any tree monster, Miss Wildman, but, as you
know, I need my beauty sleep. <br>
NAOMI: Sorry I woke you, but we have a mission. <br>
FLOTTER: You and your missions. Lucky for you, your old pal Flotter has
everything ready. Follow me. I've laid a trap. When he climbs this
tree, he'll trip the alarm. Tree monsters are terrified of high-pitched
noises. <br>
NAOMI: I never heard that. <br>
FLOTTER: Oh, it's a well known fact. The bell will scare him high into
those branches where counterweights will bend the treetop till it
springs back, catapulting him pond-ward and, splash! He'll sink like a log.
<br>
NAOMI: But Flotter, logs float. <br>
FLOTTER: Details, details. <br>(The bark-skinned tree monster looks down at them.)<br>
TREVIS: That is a terrible plan. <br>
NAOMI: It's him! <br>
TREVIS: The name's Trevis. And you are? <br>
FLOTTER: Flotter. Flotter T. Water III. <br>
TREVIS: Well, of course you are, drippy. You. <br>
NAOMI: Naomi Wildman, but my friends call me Naomi. <br>
TREVIS: I don't recognise your element. You're not earth or water or
plasma. <br>
NAOMI: I'm human. <br>
TREVIS: Where do you live? <br>
NAOMI: In space. <br>
TREVIS: Nobody lives in space. <br>
FLOTTER: She does. On a starship called Voyager. <br>
NAOMI: I'm an explorer. <br>
TREVIS: Really? An explorer. Timber. (he drops to the ground.) What's that like?&nbsp;<br>
NAOMI: Well, you know, space battles with aliens, strange anomalies. <br>
TREVIS: May I visit your starship? <br>
NAOMI: Well, I'll have to ask my mom. <br>
FLOTTER: You know, for a monster, you're very polite. <br>
TREVIS: That's because I'm not a monster. (He pulls Flotter's bell rope.)<br>TREVIS: You see that? I'm not scared
one bit. My bark is worse than my bite. <br>
NAOMI: Maybe we jumped to conclusions about him. <br>
FLOTTER: Well, he may not be a monster, but he is stealing my water
with his roots. <br>
TREVIS: Stealing? Absurd. Why, I ought to dry you up. <br>
FLOTTER: And I ought to chop you down! <br>
TREVIS: You want a piece of me? <br>
NAOMI: Excuse me! It sounds like you two need each other. I mean, think
about it. Flotter, your water helps his trees grow, and Trevis, your
branches shade his pond from the sun. It's a well-known fact that the
sun makes water evaporate. <br>
FLOTTER: She's got a point. <br>
TREVIS: The girl's a thinker. <br>
NAOMI: Now, shake hands and make up. <br>(They do. Neither likes the feel of the other's skin.) &nbsp;<br>TREVIS: Urgh. Moist palms. <br>FLOTTER: Urgh, sappy fingers.<br>NEELIX [OC]: Neelix to Holodeck two. <br>
NAOMI: Naomi here. <br>

I'll introduce him to you tomorrow as soon as you get home. <br>(The signal is not good.)<br>
WILDMAN [on monitor]: I'm afraid the away mission may take a few more
days, sweetheart. <br>
NAOMI: Days? <br>
WILDMAN [on monitor]: Yes, but I'm bringing you back some beautiful
sillinite crystals and lots of holo-pictures for your data album. Now
be a good girl and get ready for bed while I talk to Neelix. <br>

[OC]: Mayday, Mayday. Delta Flyer to Voyager. Need assistance. Warp
drive is. Impulse power is down. Thrusters only. The ion storms damaged
the primary systems. Life support is failing. Searching for an
emergency landing site. Require immediate assistance. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That was their last transmission. We haven't been able to
raise them since. <br>
TORRES: If they're looking for a place to land, they must be in pretty
bad shape. <br>
JANEWAY: Anything on long range sensors? <br>
KIM: We lost their signature when the second ion storm hit, but we've
triangulated the co-ordinates of the distress call. They've entered a
planetary system about point six light years from here. <br>
TORRES: The problem is there's another ion storm, a level five,
blocking our path. <br>
JANEWAY: Level five? We've been through worse. Let's just batten down
the hatches and reinforce the shields. We're not going to let a little
bad weather stand in our way. <br>
NEELIX: What about Naomi? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I guess somebody's going to have to explain why her mother's
not back. <br>
NEELIX: Maybe we shouldn't tell her anything. <br>
JANEWAY: Why not? <br>
NEELIX: She's a very sensitive girl. I don't want to alarm her
unnecessarily. With any luck, we'll have her mother back before she
starts to worry. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, you're closer to her than anyone. I'm inclined to let
you take the lead on this. <br>
NEELIX: Thanks, Captain. <br>

I was thinking. <br>
NEELIX: Oh? <br>
NAOMI: It's time I carried my weight around here. <br>
NEELIX: Ah. They could use a hand in the Airponics bay. <br>
NAOMI: I was thinking more of the bridge. <br>
NEELIX: Captain's assistant. <br>
NAOMI: Would I get to fly the ship? <br>
NEELIX: Well, we'd have to take it up with the Captain. <br>(Seven enters with Kim and a crewwoman.)<br>
SEVEN: Need to check the internal sensors. <br>
NAOMI: Neelix, don't move. <br>
NEELIX: What's wrong? <br>
NAOMI: The Borg lady. <br>
NEELIX: She has a name, you know. <br>
NAOMI: Seven of Nine, tertiary adjunct of Unimatrix zero one. Don't
look! She'll assimilate you. <br>
NEELIX: Naomi, Seven is a nice person, and she's a valuable member of
this crew. <br>
NAOMI: I don't want to be in her Collective. <br>
NEELIX: I don't think there's much danger of that. <br>
KIM: Hey, Neelix. Hey, Naomi. Neelix, can I talk with you? <br>
NEELIX: Yes. I'll be right back. <br>
KIM: Sickbay's running short on emergency medkits. We're going to need
a few more if we send another away team after the shuttle. <br>
NEELIX: I've got half a dozen stockpiled in Cargo Bay two. <br>
KIM: How is she? <br>
NEELIX: On the Naomi anxiety Scale of one to ten, where one is a touch
of insomnia and ten is a panic attack? About five. <br>
SEVEN: Is this chair occupied? Yes or no would suffice. <br>
NAOMI: No. I mean, yes. <br>
SEVEN: Explain. <br>
NAOMI: You can't sit here. Somebody else is sitting here. <br>
SEVEN: Very well. <br>(Seven walks away, and Neelix returns to his seat.)<br>
NEELIX: So, I thought we'd pay another visit to Sickbay. The Doctor
says he has time to give you a botany lesson. What's wrong? <br>
NAOMI: I am Borg. <br>
NEELIX: No, you're not. <br>
NAOMI: Can we go to the holodeck first? I want to play another Flotter
story. <br>
NEELIX: Well, the Doctor's expecting you. <br>
NAOMI: I don't like Sickbay. <br>
NEELIX: Why not? <br>
NAOMI: It's full of creepy things. Alien organs and hyposprays. <br>
NEELIX: Well, that's not true. <br>
NAOMI: And the Doctor talks too much. <br>
NEELIX: Well, that's his way. <br>
NAOMI: Can't you reprogramme him or something? <br>

Rumour has it there's a planetoid around here. <br>
WILDMAN: Sorry, Tom. The storm is throwing off my readings. There's
definitely a big rock nearby, I just can't find it. <br>
TUVOK: The wave front is accelerating. <br>
PARIS: How long till it hits us? <br>
TUVOK: Less than two minutes. <br>
PARIS:&nbsp;Gives me thirty seconds to land this thing. Samantha, I
don't mean to rush you. <br>
WILDMAN: Got it. Class M atmosphere, nickel-iron core, bemonite mantle.
<br>
PARIS: Bemonite. I want to land this shuttle, not bury it. <br>
WILDMAN: Seventy three thousand kilometres, bearing zero mark four. <br>
TUVOK: We've entered the upper atmosphere. <br>
WILDMAN: Nothing but impact craters, volcanoes. We can't land here. <br>
TUVOK: The storm is closing. Increasing shields to maximum. <br>
PARIS: Just keep us away from the volcanoes and we'll be okay. <br>
WILDMAN: I've got a big meteor crater, five hundred kilometres across,
three point seven deep. <br>
PARIS: I'll take it. <br>
TUVOK: Starboard thrusters are down. <br>
PARIS: Tuvok, if you don't have something positive to say. <br>
WILDMAN: We're coming in too fast! <br>
PARIS: Hang on! <br>(Bang, thump, crunch!)<br>PARIS: The Flyer has landed. <br>(Tuvok is tending to an unconscious Wildman.)<br>
TUVOK: She needs immediate medical assistance. <br>(Later -)<br>
WILDMAN: What happened? <br>
PARIS: We made it. <br>
WILDMAN: Delta Flyer's first landing. Where? <br>
PARIS: About three kilometres beneath the surface. At least our primary
hull's still in one piece. <br>
WILDMAN: Wish I felt the same. <br>
PARIS: You'll be all right. Minor concussion, a few fractures. Nothing
I can't handle. <br>
WILDMAN: You're a great nurse, but you're a lousy liar. <br>
PARIS: You've got a punctured kidney, and you're bleeding internally.
You need surgery. <br>
WILDMAN: Voyager? <br>
TUVOK: I've transmitted another distress call. No response. <br>
PARIS: It's all this rock. <br>
WILDMAN: I've got to talk to Naomi. Let her know we're okay. <br>
TUVOK: Conserve your strength, Ensign. Mister Paris and I have the
situation under control. <br>
PARIS: Nice bedside manner, Tuvok. Sam, I'm going to give you a mild
sedative and something for the pain. Any chance we could abandon the
shuttle, make our way on foot? <br>
TUVOK: Unlikely. Not only are we buried under several kilotons of rock,
but the atmosphere in this cavern is flooded with fluorine gas. <br>
PARIS: Nothing to do but sit back and enjoy the view. </font></p>

NEELIX: She misses her mother, but I don't think she suspects anything.
I was just about to take her to the holodeck for some more
storytelling. <br>
JANEWAY: Call me an optimist, Neelix, but I'm still counting on a happy
ending. <br>
NEELIX: Me, too. <br>
KIM: Got it. The impulse wake leads to the northern hemisphere.
Coordinates one twenty one mark sixteen. <br>
JANEWAY: Any sign of them? <br>
KIM: Plasma fires, hull fragments. Either they vaporised on impact or
they're buried beneath the surface. <br>
NEELIX: Any life signs? Maybe they beamed out before the crash. <br>
JANEWAY: Harry, anything? <br>
KIM: Nothing. <br>
JANEWAY: We built the Delta Flyer to take a lot of punishment. I'm
betting it held together. Commander, take rescue teams down to that

NAOMI: Mitochondria. The warp core of the cell. <br>
EMH: Exactly. Now what if I told you that this fellow was invited to
dinner, but never got around to leaving? <br>
NAOMI: What do you mean? <br>
EMH: Well, turn back the clock a few billion years to when cells first
evolved. These early cells had no mitochondria. They struggled along
without them, making do with whatever energy sources they could find.
Then, one day a mitochondrial ancestor arrived, broke though the cell
wall, and made himself at home.<br>
NAOMI: They became friends? <br>
EMH: The correct term is symbiosis. <br>

Computer, access personal database, Neelix. File index two nine one.
Hello, Alixia. I'm sorry it's been so many weeks since I've thought
about you, but we've been very busy here on Voyager. I miss you. My
goddaughter, Naomi, she's in trouble. We're in trouble. She may lose
her mother. Alixia, you always knew the right thing to do, the right
thing to say. I wish you were here to help me. </font></p>

Computer, switch to polythermal imaging and enhance resolution. Neelix,
do you require assistance? <br>
NEELIX: No. No, I was just passing by. I thought I'd pay you a visit,
see how things were going. How are things going? <br>
SEVEN: I'm mapping the caverns surrounding the crash site. <br>
NEELIX: How far do they extend? <br>
SEVEN: Approximately thirty seven kilometres. <br>
NEELIX: What about the search? Anything new? <br>
SEVEN: Every scan reveals something new, but as yet little of
relevance. <br>
NEELIX: Seven. Your family, your human family, do you ever think about
them? <br>
SEVEN: Infrequently. I was only six years old when I was assimilated. <br>
NEELIX: Not much older than Naomi is now. Do you miss your parents? <br>
SEVEN: I barely remember them. <br>
NEELIX: Maybe that's a blessing. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Rescue team alpha to Seven of Nine. <br>
SEVEN: Yes, Commander. <br>

Naomi will adapt as well. <br>

JANEWAY: Lieutenant, get me an update from Beta team. They haven't
checking in for over an hour. <br>
NEELIX: Coffee, anyone? Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: No thanks, I've had enough. One more cup and I'll jump to
warp. <br>
NEELIX: Any new? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm afraid not. <br>
NEELIX: No debris? No lifesigns? <br>
JANEWAY: We've got three teams beneath the surface. So far, nothing. <br>
NEELIX: So much for that happy ending. <br>
JANEWAY: We'll turn that planetoid inside out if we have to, but I
think we have to be prepared for the worst. Maybe it's time you told
Naomi. <br>
NEELIX: No, not yet. <br>
JANEWAY: She's an astute girl. She must be aware that something's wrong
by now. <br>
NEELIX: She's been asking a lot of tough questions. Why hasn't her
mother filed a status report? What if she's in trouble? But I've got a
big day planned for her tomorrow. Plenty of distractions. She won't
have time to be worried. <br>
JANEWAY: Your mission was to keep her occupied, not to lie to her.
First thing in the morning, I want you to explain the situation. <br>
NEELIX: I don't think that's such a good idea. <br>
JANEWAY: Why not? <br>
NEELIX: Like I told you, she's sensitive. <br>
JANEWAY: All the more reason to answer her questions. <br>
NEELIX: With all due respect, Captain, I'm her godfather. I know what's
best for her.<br>

JANEWAY: I realise you care about Naomi and you are only trying to
protect her, but you've got to tell her the truth. <br>
NEELIX: Good morning, Naomi. Would you like some papalla juice with
your cereal? And, oh, by the way, your mother is buried under thirty
kilotons of rock. <br>
JANEWAY: Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: When we know something for sure. When we find her mother, alive
or dead, I'll, I'll tell her then. Not before. <br>
JANEWAY: If you can't do it, I will. <br>
NEELIX: You don't have the right. You don't understand what's at stake
here! When you were her age you were safe and sound on Earth with two
healthy parents to take care of you. You never had to worry about the
possibility of being alone! You take it from me, you wouldn't have
liked it. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, I know. You must identify with Naomi's situation. <br>
NEELIX: When my family was killed, I lost everything. I still have
nightmares. It hasn't been easy. I don't want Naomi to go through what
I did. <br>
JANEWAY: I understand. And you're right. But this situation is
different. <br>
NEELIX: How so? <br>
JANEWAY: Naomi has you. Neelix, she has to be told. But I know she'll
be better off having you here to help her through it. <br>
NEELIX: First thing in the morning. <br>
JANEWAY: We've got a few hours until then. Why don't you come back on

their sensors won't be able to pick us up. <br>

TUVOK: Do not give up hope. The probability of our being rescued is
low, but not statistically impossible. <br>
PARIS: Comforting. <br>
WILDMAN: Who's going to look after Naomi? <br>
TUVOK: You should not concern yourself with that now. <br>
WILDMAN: How can you say that? <br>
TUVOK: My youngest child has been without a father for four years, yet I
am certain of her well-being, that I conveyed my values to her before
leaving. And I have confidence in the integrity of those around her.
You have been an exemplary mother to Naomi, and she is in the hands of
people you trust. She will survive and prosper, no matter what becomes
of us. <br>
