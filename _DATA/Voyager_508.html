JANEWAY: Lieutenant Thomas Eugene Paris. I hereby reduce you to the
rank of Ensign, and I sentence you to thirty days solitary confinement.
Take Ensign Paris to the brig.<br>

A few days later, he decides to do some push-ups.)<br>PARIS:
One, two, three <br>(The door opens.)<br>PARIS: Ninety eight, ninety nine, one hundred. <br>
NEELIX: Staying in shape? <br>
PARIS: Oh, yeah. I do it every time I'm in jail. <br>
NEELIX: Well, I hope all that exercise gave you an appetite. <br>
PARIS: Leola root stew again? That's the third time this week. Can't
you just replicate me a pizza? <br>
NEELIX: Sorry, Tom. Basic nutrition only. Captain's orders. <br>
PARIS: Bread and water, huh? Let's have it. <br>(The guard lowers the forcefield and Neelix hands over the tray. The forcefield is raised again.)<br>
NEELIX: I got you the PADD you asked for. <br>
PARIS: Oh, thanks. So, did you ask the warden about those holodeck
privileges? <br>
NEELIX: She said, and I quote, tell Mister Paris this is punishment,
not shore leave. <br>
PARIS: It was worth a try. <br>
NEELIX: Well, see you next meal. <br>
PARIS: Wait. Leaving already? Pull up a chair, stay a while. <br>
NEELIX: Sorry. No non-essential conversation with the prisoner. <br>
PARIS: Did the words cruel and unusual mean anything to her? I'm
telling you, Neelix, the inmates are getting restless. She's going to
have a full-blown prison riot on her hands. <br>(Neelix leaves. Paris picks up the PADD and thinks for a while.)<br>PARIS: Begin letter. Dear Father.
Pause and erase. Begin. To Admiral Paris. Pause and erase. Begin. Hey,
Dad, long time no see. Chances are you'll never receive this letter,
but in case you do, there's a few things I wanted to say. First of all,
bad news. Er, I'm in jail again. Wait, keep listening, don't turn this
off. I want you to know how I ended up in here because it's not what
you think. It all started on a morning I was doing something you would
find a complete waste of time. </font></p>

KIM: How many times do I have to tell you? I like Megan, but she won't
give me the time of day. <br>
PARIS: What is the difference? <br>
KIM: You can't be serious. <br>
PARIS: They're the Delaney sisters, Harry. They're twins. <br>
KIM: Are you kidding? They're nothing alike. Jenny's aggressive and
sometimes annoying. But Megan, she's quiet, artistic, and she's got
that cute little dimple in her right cheek. <br>

JANEWAY: Sorry to interrupt your fun, gentlemen, but long range sensors
have picked up something interesting. <br>
CHAKOTAY: A concentrated mass of oxygen and hydrogen. Lots of animal
and plant life. <br>
KIM: An M-class planet? <br>
JANEWAY: No, that's the interesting part. <br>
TUVOK: We're entering visual range. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. <br>(A blue planet. Uniformly blue all over.)<br>
KIM: What is it? <br>
PARIS: It's an ocean. <br>
CHAKOTAY: According to these readings, it's bigger than the Atlantic
and Pacific combined. <br>
PARIS: What's holding it together? <br>
KIM: Looks like there's some sort of containment field keeping it from
dissipating. <br>
JANEWAY: Take us in closer, Tom. <br>(Three vessels fly out of the water.)<br>
PARIS: Are those starships or submarines? <br>
JANEWAY: Open a channel. This is Captain Janeway of the Starship
Voyager. Please identify yourselves. <br>
TUVOK: They are powering weapons. <br>
JANEWAY: Shields. Red alert. <br>
TUVOK: Shields holding, no damage. Should I return fire? <br>
JANEWAY: Not yet. Voyager to approaching vessels. We have no hostile
intentions. <br>
PARIS: They're maintaining their course. <br>
JANEWAY: Target the lead ship and take out their weapons.<br>
TUVOK: Direct hit. <br>
KIM: They're hailing. <br>
JANEWAY: I guess we got their attention. On screen. <br>(A lipless humanoid appears.)<br>
BURKUS [on viewscreen]: I'm Deputy Consul Burkus of the Monean Maritime
Sovereignty. You've violated our space. Withdraw or we'll resume firing. <br>
JANEWAY: Consul, we could have destroyed your ships, but we didn't. We
have no interest in a fight. <br>
BURKUS [on viewscreen]: Then why are you here? <br>
JANEWAY: Because we're explorers, and we're fascinated by your ocean.
And we'd like to learn more about it, and your people if you'd be
willing. <br>
BURKUS [on viewscreen]: And if we are not? <br>
JANEWAY: We'll be disappointed, but we'll leave you alone. <br>
BURKUS [on viewscreen]: Your ship's impressive. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, I'd be happy to give you a tour. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Three Moneans come aboard.)<br>BURKUS:
Forgive our vigilance, Captain. Over the years, my government has had
to protect our ocean from more than one hostile species. <br>
JANEWAY: I understand. We're also very protective of our own natural
resources. <br>
NEELIX: We're always interested in learning about other cultures. Yours
sounds particularly fascinating. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: And this is Voyager's command centre. Feel free to have a look
around. <br>
NEELIX: I'm curious, Consul. Have your people always lived here? <br>
BURKUS: Our ancestors were nomadic. They only discovered the waters
three hundred years ago. <br>
PARIS: I'll bet they were as stunned as we were to find this huge ball
of water floating in space. <br>
BURKUS: Yes. Mister? <br>
PARIS: Paris. Tom Paris. <br>
JANEWAY: My First Officer, Commander Chakotay. <br>
BURKUS: They realised they could farm sea vegetation, extract oxygen
from the ocean for their ships, create a permanent home. <br>
PARIS: What's your population? <br>
BURKUS: More than eighty thousand. <br>
PARIS: And you all live underwater? <br>
TUVOK: Lieutenant, we do have other business to attend to. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok, escort our guest to the briefing room. Care to
join us, Mister Paris? <br>
PARIS: How could you tell? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Briefing
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> NEELIX:
Do you still live aboard your ships? <br>
BURKUS: We've built an industrial infrastructure and undersea
dwellings, but yes, most of our people still choose to live as our
ancestors did. <br>
JANEWAY: Any idea how the ocean came into existence? In my experience,
it's a unique phenomenon. <br>
BURKUS: Riga? <br>
RIGA: There are several theories. Our clerics teach that the ocean was
a divine gift from the creators to protect and sustain us. But, in my
opinion, the most plausible explanation is that the ocean formed
naturally, much the same way that a gas giant does. <br>
JANEWAY: Makes sense. <br>
RIGA: Unfortunately, our limited knowledge of the phenomenon has
created a few problems. <br>
JANEWAY: What do you mean? <br>
BURKUS: I'm not sure this is an appropriate topic. <br>
RIGA: But they might be able to help us. <br>
JANEWAY: We'll do anything we can. <br>
RIGA: The ocean's losing containment. Hydro-volume has decreased more
than seven percent in the last year alone. <br>
JANEWAY: Any idea what's causing it? <br>
RIGA: No. To make a thorough study we'd need to explore the ocean
centre where I believe the gravitational currents are fluctuating. <br>
PARIS: But that's more that six hundred kilometres deep. <br>
RIGA: Our best research vessel can only go one hundred kilometres.
Beyond that the pressure's too great.&nbsp;<br>
PARIS: Well, we could take you there. Captain? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Ready
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Over a pot of tea.)<br>JANEWAY: I had no idea you were such an old salt. <br>
PARIS: When I saw that ocean today, it reminded me of the first time I
read Jules Verne. <br>
JANEWAY: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. <br>
PARIS: I must have read it twenty thousand times. I was obsessed with
stories about the ocean. All of my friends were busy with their
holoprogrammes. I had my head buried in Captains Courageous, Moby Dick.
<br>
JANEWAY: So your interest in history includes the nineteenth century as
well?<br>
PARIS: Ancient sailing ships were always my first love. I had it all
planned. Finish high school, join the Federation Naval Patrol. But my
father had other ideas. <br>
JANEWAY: You'd think Admiral Paris might have understood his son's
passion. <br>
PARIS: As far as he was concerned, the only ship I was going to serve on
had to have a Starfleet insignia on it. <br>
JANEWAY: So now you have an opportunity to make up for lost time. <br>
PARIS: Captain, with a few simple thruster modifications to the Delta
Flyer, she will be seaworthy in no time. <br>
JANEWAY: Good. It'd take at least a week to make the necessary
modifications to Voyager. <br>
PARIS: Then it's my mission? <br>
JANEWAY: Bon voyage. </font></p>

And so, I thought to myself, who better than Harry to be my first mate?
<br>
KIM: First mate? <br>
PARIS: Oh, sailor talk. You'll get the hang of it.&nbsp;I'm telling you, Harry, I have been dreaming about something
like this for as long as I can remember. <br>
KIM: Correct me if I'm wrong, but there is a mission involved here,
right? <br>
PARIS: Of course, but there's no law says we can't have a little fun
along the way. Ah, boatswain. Ready to shove off? <br>
SEVEN: What are you talking about, Lieutenant? <br>
PARIS: Call me Skipper. <br>
KIM: Sailor talk. You'll get used to it. <br>
SEVEN: I think not. Hull and thruster reinforcements are complete. <br>
PARIS: That's what I wanted to hear.&nbsp;<br>
RIGA: Oh, excuse me. Am I in the right place? <br>
PARIS: Welcome aboard. I see you like to travel light. <br>
RIGA: These are my instruments for measuring depth, pressure, currents.
<br>
SEVEN: We will not need them. This vessel is equipped with a complete
sensor array. <br>

SEVEN: Active. <br>
PARIS: Anchors aweigh. <br>(The Delta Flyer enters the ocean. They glide down past tall buildings and other things.)<br>PARIS:
Those structures, what are they? <br>
RIGA: It's our main oxygen refinery and desalination plant. <br>
SEVEN: Corrosion resistant alloys, variable density ballast. An
efficient design. <br>
KIM: That means she's impressed. <br>
RIGA: We're very proud of what we've built here. <br>

JANEWAY: Come in. <br>(Chakotay escorts Burkus.)<br>JANEWAY: I'm afraid we have some disturbing news. <br>
BURKUS: Oh? <br>
JANEWAY: We've run a computer simulation to determine the rate of
dissipation. It's worse than Mister Riga thought. <br>
CHAKOTAY: According to our estimates the ocean could experience a
complete loss of containment in less than five years. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry. <br>
BURKUS: Your calculations could be wrong. <br>
JANEWAY: I know it sounds grim, but there may be some way to stop the
process. <br>
BURKUS: And if there isn't? <br>
JANEWAY: You might have to consider evacuating. <br>
BURKUS: I'm supposed to go back and explain this to forty seven
regional sovereigns? They'll pass their first unanimous resolution,
calling for my head. <br>
JANEWAY: I can imagine how difficult this must be for you, but you will
have to tell them. <br>
BURKUS: Perhaps, but I'll wait until your Delta Flyer returns. Maybe
they'll find something tangible. </font></p>

We're at a depth of five hundred and sixty kilometres. <br>(Creak)<br>
RIGA: What was that? <br>
SEVEN: The hull contracting. <br>
KIM: Rerouting additional power to structural integrity. Nothing to
worry about. <br>
SEVEN: I'm detecting multiphasic energy discharges bearing zero one two
mark six. Range twelve kilometres. A structure. <br>
RIGA: At this depth? <br>
PARIS: Adjusting course. I can't see anything. Give me forward
illumination, Harry. <br>
RIGA: What is it? <br>
KIM: It's generating massive amounts of artificial gravity. Looks like
some kind of field reactor. <br>
RIGA: If it's malfunctioning that would explain the loss of
hydro-volume. <br>
PARIS: Maybe it can be repaired. It looks ancient. <br>
KIM: Well, if these readings are right, it's at least a hundred thousand
years old. <br>
RIGA: We have no records of any previous inhabitants. Who built it?
Where did they go? <br>
KIM: Looks like the reactor's controlled by a core computer. I'll try
to upload the database and get some answers. <br>
PARIS: Initiate the interface. <br>
SEVEN: Upload in progress <br>(The Flyer shudders and an alarm sounds.). <br>
RIGA: What's happening? <br>
PARIS: We've got a visitor. <br>(A massive creature swims above them.)<br>
RIGA: What was it? <br>
KIM: You're the one who lives here. You tell us. <br>
RIGA: No one's ever been this far down before. We don't know anything
about marine life at these depths. <br>
SEVEN: You are about to have the opportunity to make a detailed study.
<br>(They get rammed.)<br>SEVEN: The creature is emitting biothermic discharges. <br>
KIM: It's like some kind of electric eel. <br>
PARIS: Only a hell of a lot bigger. <br>
SEVEN: And significantly more powerful. That last discharge exceeded
five hundred thousand volts. <br>
KIM: The shields are fried, Tom. You might want to think about getting
us out of here. <br>(Another big hit.)<br>
PARIS: Thrusters are offline. <br>
SEVEN: Targeting forward phasers. <br>
RIGA: No, you can't kill it. <br>
SEVEN: I do not intend to. Unfortunately the creature does not seem to
be of a similar opinion. <br>

Five ships? And they just opened fire without warning? <br>

EMH: Apparently, Ensign Culhane confused the enemy with a brilliant
series of evasive manoeuvres. I hear Captain Janeway is considering him
for Chief Conn. officer. <br>
PARIS: Oh, yeah? Well, you just tell the Captain that Culhane's
brilliant manoeuvres almost knocked me unconscious. You'd think he'd
never flown a shuttle, much less a starship. <br>
EMH: There we are, <br>

should be granted a medical reprieve. <br>
EMH: Your injury was what Naomi Wildman refers to as a boo-boo. <br>

here all day, every day. I'm going crazy. <br>
EMH: Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that the idea? <br>

a full psychiatric evaluation. Three or four days of observation at
least.<br>

What's that? <br>
SEVEN: A gravimetric discharge. The reactor's core is unstable. <br>
PARIS: You'd be unstable too if you were as old as this thing. <br>
KIM: Age has nothing to do with it. The reactor's diverting massive
amounts of power to its structural integrity field. Power normally
reserved for oceanic containment. <br>
PARIS: That would explain why containment is weakening. <br>
KIM: Looks like the density of the water's been increasing over the
past few years. It seems the reactor's just trying to keep itself from
being crushed. <br>

into orbit. They used some kind of elaborate kinetic transfer system to
draw the water and everything in it up to the reactor. <br>
RIGA: Extraordinary. Why would anyone want to move an entire ocean? <br>
PARIS: Maybe there was some kind of disaster on the planet, or maybe it
was just an experiment. <br>
RIGA: That must have been a massive undertaking. <br>
PARIS: Took them almost two hundred years. <br>
RIGA: I wonder what they'd think if they knew we settled here and built
another civilisation. <br>
PARIS: Actually, I think they'd be pretty concerned. <br>
RIGA: Oh? <br>
PARIS: This field reactor that they designed, it's a pretty amazing
piece of technology. Durable. I don't think it's responsible for the
loss of containment. <br>
RIGA: But as soon as we made the recalibration, the water stabilised. I
don't see what else it could be. <br>
PARIS: Riga, your mining operations are destroying the ocean. </font></p>

[OC]: Resume recording, So, we told Consul Burkus about the alien field
reactor and how his oxygen refineries were destroying it. He took the
news pretty well. At first. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Briefing
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> BURKUS:
The Council's very grateful for your help, Captain. They've asked me to
request the shield and thruster schematics for your Delta Flyer. We're
hoping to design a probe that'll allow us to monitor the containment
generator. <br>
JANEWAY: Lieutenant Torres will give you everything you need. <br>
TORRES: I've also drawn up some designs for an oxygen replication
system. It'll allow you to create free oxygen without extricating it
from the water. It won't solve your problems overnight, but it's a
start. <br>
BURKUS: I'm sure it'll be very helpful. <br>
RIGA: Our oxygen extraction levels are still dangerously high. I'm
going to recommend shutting down refineries four, five and six. <br>
BURKUS: We'll take it under advisement. Well, Captain, I wish you a
safe journey. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, we have a few more suggestions if you'd like to hear them.
<br>
BURKUS: Please. Pass them along to Mister Riga. He'll include them in
his report. <br>
PARIS: I'm curious. Who's going to read that report? <br>
BURKUS: It will be given to the subcommittees on life support and
agriculture. <br>
RIGA: Excuse me, Consul. I'm not sure you understand the magnitude of
the crisis. What you're suggesting could take months. <br>
BURKUS: Thank you, Mister Riga. <br>
PARIS: You should listen to him. If you don't make some serious changes
around here soon, that ocean won't be here much longer. <br>
BURKUS: As I said, we understand his concerns. <br>
PARIS: Do you? Seems to me like you're just trying to sidestep the
issue and send us on our way. <br>
BURKUS: With all due respect, who are you to tell us what to do with
our ocean? <br>
PARIS: With all due respect, it's not your ocean.<br>
JANEWAY: Lieutenant. <br>
BURKUS: It's all right, Captain. I'd like to respond, but not as a
diplomat, as a Monean. You came here claiming you wanted to learn about
our way of life and now, having spent three days here, you're
suggesting we abandon it. We have an expression. Brine in the veins.
Tell him what it means. <br>
RIGA: It's used to describe someone who has special connection to the
waters. <br>
BURKUS: My family has lived here for ten generations. We protected this
ocean, cultivated it, lived in harmony with the animals that inhabit
it. Can you say the same? I didn't think so. Good day, Captain. <br>(The three Moneans leave.)<br>
PARIS: We can't just let this go. <br>
JANEWAY: What do you want me to do? <br>
PARIS: Of course. The almighty Prime Directive. <br>
JANEWAY: Would you please excuse us, Lieutenant? <br>
TORRES: See you later. &nbsp;<br>(Torres leaves.)<br>
JANEWAY: I know you're upset, Lieutenant, but when you're in a room
with me you check that attitude at the door, understood? <br>
PARIS: Captain, I'm sorry <br>
JANEWAY: We can't expect an entire society to change because we think
they should. <br>
PARIS: Then you agree with me. <br>
JANEWAY: Yes, and we gave them the help they asked for. We told them
what we know. Now it's up to them to do what they think is appropriate.
<br>
PARIS: You heard that Consul. They're not going to do a damn thing. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe not, but that's their prerogative. <br>
PARIS: Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: End of discussion, Lieutenant. At fourteen hundred hours,
we'll resume a course for the Alpha Quadrant. Is that clear. Is that
clear? <br>
PARIS: As a bell. </font></p>

gone one day, it started to matter to me. It sounds pretty stupid, huh?

RIGA: I think the bureaucracy isn't going to make more than token
changes. <br>
PARIS: Isn't there anything else you can do? <br>
RIGA: I don't see how, other than taking the oxygen refineries offline.
<br>
PARIS: What would happen, hypothetically, if someone were to shut down
the refineries? <br>
RIGA: Well, I suppose they'd have to be rebuilt. <br>
PARIS: Yeah, and they'd probably be more willing to redesign them while
they're at it. If nothing else, it would grab their attention. <br>

insubordination, unauthorised use of a spacecraft, reckless
endangerment, and conduct unbecoming an officer. Do you have anything

JANEWAY: In doing so, you disobeyed my direct orders. <br>
PARIS: Yes, ma'am. <br>
JANEWAY: You violated the protocols that govern this crew. <br>

JANEWAY: You nearly caused an armed conflict with the Moneans. And
frankly, you're lucky to be standing here right now. I would have
destroyed your shuttle if necessary. <br>
PARIS: Yes, ma'am. Permission to speak freely. Riga's people weren't
going to listen. They were going to ignore our warnings. <br>
JANEWAY: You don't know that. <br>
PARIS: Riga knew, and I was the only one who could help them. <br>
JANEWAY: I understand your passion, but passion alone doesn't give you
the right to take matters into your own hands. Four years ago, I
released you from prison and gave you a fresh start. Until now, you've
been a fine officer. Your service on this ship has been exemplary. I
really believed you were past this kind of conduct. <br>
PARIS: I've never been very good at playing by the rules. That doesn't
mean that serving under your command hasn't changed me, for the better.
At least this time, I broke the rules for a reason. For something I
believed in. <br>
JANEWAY: I admire your principles, Tom, but I can't ignore what you've
done. I hereby reduce you to the rank of Ensign, and I sentence you to
thirty days solitary confinement. Take Ensign Paris to the brig. <br>
