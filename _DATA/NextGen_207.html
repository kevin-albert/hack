celebrated Ambassadors, an advisor to Federation leaders for
generations, disappeared. <br>
SAREK: I gave Spock the benefit of experience, of logic. He never
listened. <br>
PICARD: It's been suggested that Spock might have defected.<br>
RIKER: Why would anyone want a Vulcan shield array? <br>
LAFORGE: Beats me, Commander. Every question we answer here seems to
bring up two more.<br>
K'VADA: Be careful, android. Some Romulan beauty might take a liking to
you. Lick that paint right off your ears. You. Do you know what the
Romulans will do to you if they discover who you are?<br>
PICARD: I have a good idea. <br>
WORF: Sir, the ship is locking phasers.<br>
RIKER: Shields up. Red alert.<br>
NERAL: What do you know of this human? Jean-Luc Picard, a Starfleet
Captain. <br>
PICARD: You've made a mistake.<br>
ROMULAN 1: Quiet. Come with us. <br>
PICARD: I have come on an urgent mission from the Federation. I'm
looking for Ambassador Spock.<br>
SPOCK: You have found him, Captain Picard. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: What are you doing on Romulus? <br>
PICARD: That was to have been my question of you, sir. <br>
SPOCK: It is no concern of Starfleet. <br>
PICARD: On the contrary, it is very much Starfleet's concern. You're in
a position to compromise the security of the Federation. <br>
SPOCK: You may assure your superiors, Captain, that I am here on a
personal mission of peace, and I will advise Starfleet when it is
appropriate. <br>
PICARD: That is not satisfactory. <br>
SPOCK: You cannot remain here, Captain Picard.<br>
PICARD: And I will not return without a full explanation. Ambassador,
with great respect for all that you've achieved on behalf of the
Federation, this sort of cowboy diplomacy will not easily be tolerated
any more. <br>
SPOCK: Cowboy diplomacy? <br>
PICARD: If you wish to undertake a mission with obvious repercussions
to the Federation, then you should discuss it with the Federation. I'm
here as their representative. You'll have to discuss it with me.<br>
SPOCK: That is precisely what I had hoped to avoid.<br>
PICARD: I also have the responsibility of being the bearer of unhappy
news.<br>
SPOCK: Sarek? Sarek is dead? Walk with me, Picard.

SPOCK: I know of your mind-meld with my father which enabled him to
complete his last mission.<br>
PICARD: It was an honour. He is a great man.<br>
SPOCK: He was a great representative of the Vulcan people and of the
Federation.<br>
PICARD: I was with him before coming here. He expressed his pride in
you. His love.<br>
SPOCK: Emotional disarray was a symptom of the illness from which he
suffered.<br>
PICARD: No, those feelings came from his heart, Spock. He shared them
with me. I know.<br>
SPOCK: Sarek would no more approve my coming here than you do, Picard.
For some time now, I've been aware of a growing movement here of people
who seek to learn the ideals of the Vulcan philosophy. They've been
declared enemies
of the state. But there are a few in the Romulan hierarchy like Pardek,
who are sympathetic. He asked me to come now, because he believes it
may be time to take the first step toward reunification.<br>
PICARD: Reunification? After so many centuries? After so many
fundamental differences have evolved between your peoples?<br>
SPOCK: It would seem unlikely to succeed, but I cannot ignore the
potential rewards that a union between our two worlds would bring.<br>
PICARD: What is this first step that Pardek suggests?<br>
SPOCK: There is a new Proconsul in the Romulan Senate. He is young and
idealistic. He has promised many reforms. Pardek believes that he may
be receptive to discussing reunification.<br>
PICARD: Why would you not bring something so important to the attention
of your own people or the Federation?<br>
SPOCK: A personal decision, Captain. Perhaps you are aware of the small
role I played in the overture to peace with the Klingons.<br>
PICARD: History is aware of the role you played, Ambassador.<br>
SPOCK: Not entirely. It was I who committed Captain Kirk to that peace
mission, and I who had to bear the responsibility for the
consequences to him and his crew. Quite simply, I am unwilling to risk
anyone's life but my own on this occasion. So I ask you respect my
wishes and leave. <br>
PICARD: Ambassador, your logic escapes me. If I didn't know better, I
would say that your judgment is influenced by your emotions.<br>
SPOCK: You speak as my father would if he were here, Picard. <br>
PICARD: I speak as a Starfleet officer, and I cannot ignore the risks
to you. <br>
SPOCK: I was involved with cowboy diplomacy, as you describe it, long
before you were born.<br>
PICARD: Nevertheless, sir, I'm not prepared to leave until your affairs
are completed.<br>
SPOCK: In your own way, you are as stubborn as another Captain of the
Enterprise I once knew.<br>
PICARD: Then I'm in good company, sir.

than acting as your nursemaids.<br>
DATA: Captain Picard regrets detaining you, but it will be necessary
for a while longer. In addition, I require access to your ship's
computer. <br>
K'VADA: Access to our computer? For what purpose?<br>
DATA: I am going to attempt to penetrate the Romulan Central
Information net.<br>
K'VADA: Don't bother. We've been trying for years.<br>
DATA: I have unique skills that may allow me to succeed.<br>
K'VADA: I cannot reveal classified Klingon entry codes to Starfleet. <br>
DATA: Your entry codes can be easily reconfigured after we depart. And
Captain Picard has authorised me to share with you any information we
obtain from the Romulan databanks. <br>
K'VADA: Anything else?<br>
DATA: We will also need to communicate with the Enterprise in sector
two thirteen.<br>
K'VADA: You do and the Romulans will instantly know our co-ordinates.<br>
DATA: Using conventional means, that would be true. However, I suggest
we piggy-back our signal on Romulan subspace transmissions.<br>
K'VADA: Piggy-back?<br>
DATA: A human metaphor, pardon me. We would use a Romulan signal as a
carrier for own
one, thus disguising its origin.<br>
K'VADA: It won't work.<br>
DATA: I believe it would. During the last hour, I have conducted a
systematic review of the entire Romulan subspace grid. I have compared
my findings with the specifications of your own transmission array.
They appear to be compatible.<br>

ROMULAN 1: Allow me to brighten your table. Jolan tru.<br>
SPOCK: The Senate has adjourned. Pardek will be here shortly.<br>
PICARD: How widespread is this movement?<br>
SPOCK: There are groups in every populated area. I've personally spoken
with members from four provinces. It has become a serious concern for
the Romulan leadership.<br>
PICARD: Serious enough for the leaders to suddenly embrace a Vulcan
peace initiative? I have some difficulty in accepting that.<br>
SPOCK: I sense you have a closed mind, Captain. Closed minds have kept
these two worlds apart for centuries. In the Federation, we have
learned from experience to view the Romulans with distrust. We can
either choose to live with that enmity or seek an opportunity to change
it. I choose the latter. <br>
PICARD: I will be the first to cheer when the Neutral Zone is
abolished. But I wonder if this movement is strong enough to reshape
the entire Romulan political landscape.<br>
SPOCK: One can begin to reshape the landscape with a single flower,
Captain.<br>
D'TAN: Jolan Tru, Mister Spock. Here, look what I've brought you. <br>
(it is a small book) <br>
SPOCK: This is my friend, D'Tan. He's very curious about Vulcan. <br>
PICARD: Hello, D'Tan. <br>
SPOCK: Where did you get this? This is very old. <br>
D'TAN: They read to us from it at the meetings. It tells the story of
the Vulcan separation. <br>
PARDEK: D'Tan, you should not bring that out here. You've been told
many times. <br>
D'TAN: I just wanted to show it to Mister Spock. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PARDEK: So, what do you think of your enemy,
Captain Picard?<br>
PICARD: These people are no one's enemy, Senator.<br>
PARDEK: Many of my colleagues fear what they have to say. But I have
learned to listen carefully. Children like D'Tan are our future. Old
men like me will not be able to hold on to ancient prejudice and
hostility. Young people won't allow it. But now, now that they've met
their first real Vulcan, it has only inspired them more. I am sure that
is evident to you, Spock. <br>
SPOCK: I did not anticipate such a passionate response to my arrival.<br>
PARDEK: Romulans are passionate people. The Vulcans will learn to
appreciate that quality in us.<br>

SPOCK: And do you believe that you can gain the support of your full

NERAL: Things are not what they once were in the Senate. The old
leaders have lost the respect of the people. Involvement in the Klingon
War, endless confrontations with the Federation, they're tired of it.
Times are changing, and leaders who refuse to change with them will no
longer be leaders. Spock, I am prepared to publicly endorse the opening
of talks between our peoples. What do you think the Vulcan people think
of that?<br>

overcome.<br>

Proconsul without the support of the Romulan traditionalists.<br>
PARDEK: That may be true.<br>
PICARD: Then how can he turn his back on them so easily? How can he
endorse reunification when it's considered subversive?<br>
ROMULAN 1: Because he's not afraid of them. He knows that we'll support
him. <br>
SPOCK: Captain Picard is correct. It is not logical for the Proconsul
to support reunification at this time.<br>

Captain, toward reunification and perhaps toward me.<br>

with me.<br>
SPOCK: I always had a different vision than my father. The ability to
see beyond pure logic. He considered it weak, but I have discovered it
to be a source of extraordinary strength. Sarek would have seen this
mission of reunification as a fool's errand, but somehow I think it is
not. Logic cannot explain why, I know that I must pursue this. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: Captain, the Romulan subspace logs identify a
transmission from the Romulan surface to a Barolian ship near Galorndon
Core twelve hours ago.<br>
K'VADA: Galorndon Core is along the Barolian trade route. They trade a
great deal with the Romulans. It's probably just routine. <br>
DATA: This would not appear to be routine. I was able to trace the
source of the transmission. It incorporates the code prefix of Romulan
intelligence.<br>
PICARD: Can you access it?<br>
DATA: It is a short sequence of numbers. One four zero zero. <br>
PICARD: Nothing more?<br>
DATA: No, sir.

SPOCK: I have been meeting with the Proconsul. <br>
D'TAN: Does he still speak of reunification?<br>
SPOCK: He speaks of nothing else.

(odd shapes small blocks) <br>
SPOCK: The syllabic nucleus of the Vulcan language. <br>
D'TAN: They were my toys when I was small. <br>
SPOCK: Your parents wanted you to learn to understand Vulcan?<br>
D'TAN: Yes, as did their parents before them, to prepare us for the day
when we would live again with our Vulcan cousins.<br>
ROMULAN 1: Your friends from the Federation have returned. They need to
see you immediately. I've told Pardek. He'll meet you at the cave. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: The only communication that was sent were
the numbers one four zero zero.<br>
PARDEK: What does it mean?<br>
SPOCK: It means that the Proconsul has apparently been attempting to
deceive me. For what purpose I cannot say yet.
But his conversations with me have obviously been part of a greater
plan which involves the stolen Vulcan ship.<br>
DATA: How do you know that, Ambassador?<br>
SPOCK: The time the Proconsul set for the subspace announcement of our
peace initiative is fourteen hundred hours tomorrow. One four zero zero.<br>
PARDEK: Why would they need a Vulcan ship?<br>
SELA: That will become clear very shortly. Captain Picard, welcome to
Romulus. I trust you've enjoyed your visit. And this is the android I
have come to respect
in battle. <br>
DATA: Lieutenant Commander Data.<br>
PARDEK: How could they know of this location? Someone has betrayed us. <br>
SPOCK: Yes. You did.<br>
PARDEK: Spock, we've been friends for eighty years. <br>
SPOCK: It is the only logical conclusion. You asked me to Romulus, you
arranged the meetings with the Proconsul, and you knew that Picard and
Data had returned to the surface with new information.<br>
SELA: The great Spock. Very well. Senator Pardek, your service to the
Romulan people is noted and appreciated.<br>
PARDEK: Jolan tru, Spock.<br>
SELA: Do not be distressed. Your dream of reunification is not dead. It
will simply take a different form. The Romulan conquest of Vulcan.
Bring them.

WORF: Sir, a coded subspace signal from Romulus. It's the Captain. <br>
TROI: What? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SELA: Come in, gentlemen. Take a seat, please. (she
continues working on a PADD) Excuse me, I'm just finishing up a speech.
For you, Mister Spock. I rather enjoy writing. I don't get to do it
often in this job. <br>
DATA: Perhaps you would be happier in another job.<br>
SELA: Please feel free to change any words that you wish. I've tried to
make it sound Vulcan. A lot of unnecessarily long words. In a few
hours, you will deliver this statement alongside our Senate Proconsul.
It will announce to the Vulcan people that a peace envoy is on its way
from Romulus. We will transmit it on all Federation subspace
frequencies.<br>
PICARD: Peace envoy, in a stolen Vulcan ship. <br>
SELA: Actually, three Vulcan ships, Captain. The Enterprise is only
aware of the one we stole from Qualor Two. We have been following your
investigation. It has forced us to make some minor changes. One of
them, a message sent in your name, ordering them to stay where they are.<br>
PICARD: The moment those Vulcan ships appear in the Neutral Zone, the
Enterprise will move to intercept. <br>
SELA: In that event, the Enterprise will be given more important
matters to attend to. In the meantime, Ambassador Spock will be telling
his people to welcome the peace envoy. And when they do, our forces
will seize control before anyone realises what has happened.<br>
PICARD: Do you seriously believe that the Federation will not
immediately intervene?<br>
SELA: Of course it will, and we're fully prepared for it. But we will
be there, entrenched, and it will be very difficult to get us out once
we are. Reunification will become a fact of life.<br>
SPOCK: I will not read this or any other statement.<br>
SELA: If you do not, you will die. All of you will die.<br>
SPOCK: Since it is logical to conclude that you will kill us in any
event, I choose not to cooperate.<br>
SELA: I hate Vulcans. I hate the logic. I hate the arrogance. Very
well. Computer, holographic
programme Spock One. By taking advantage of holographic sampling during
the last several days, we have created a programmable Spock. Run
programme!<br>
HOLO-SPOCK: This is Ambassador Spock of Vulcan. By now, Federation
sensors are tracking three Vulcan ships crossing the Neutral Zone.
These ships carry the future of the Romulan and Vulcan people. Our long
conflict is finally over. <br>
SELA: Freeze. We would have preferred an interactive Spock who could
have responded to questions, but this will have to suffice. <br>
PICARD: You can hardly believe this will convince anyone.<br>
SELA: I don't need to convince them. Just confuse them long enough to
reach Vulcan. End
programme. If you'll excuse me, it's time to send our ships on their
journey. <br>
(Sela and the guards leave) <br>
PICARD: Suggestions?<br>
SPOCK: Commander Data, are they still unaware that we have access to
their computers?<br>
DATA: I believe so, Ambassador.<br>

WORF: One four three mark zero one two. <br>
LAFORGE: That would put them on a course to Vulcan. They don't seem to
be in any hurry. They're only moving at warp one, Commander.<br>
RIKER: Worf, signal them on subspace. Request their status. Geordi, see
if you can tell if it's one of ships we've been looking for.<br>
WORF: They say they are escorting a peace envoy from Romulus to Vulcan.
They request that we monitor Federation subspace channels. Ambassador
Spock will be making an announcement shortly. <br>
TROI: Perhaps his reunification talks were successful. <br>

SPOCK: The reason for my coming here has never been more clear. The
union of Vulcan and the Romulan people will not be achieved by politics
or by diplomacy, but it will be achieved. The answer has been here
before us all along. An inexorable evolution toward a Vulcan philosophy
has already begun. Like the first Vulcans, these people are struggling
to a new enlightenment. It may take decades, even centuries for them to
reach it, but they will reach it. And I must help.<br>
PICARD: I have learned it is useless to argue with you once your mind
is set.<br>
SPOCK: Not at all, Captain. I have found our arguments quite useful.
Almost as useful as those I had with my father.<br>
PICARD: Would it surprise you to learn that he found them equally
valuable?<br>
SPOCK: Ironically, you may know Sarek better than his own son does. My
father and I never chose to meld.<br>
