Hmm. There. <br>
ICHEB: Excellent. You recognized the complementary base pair. <br>
NAOMI: Actually, I just found two pieces that fit together. <br>
ICHEB: You're missing the point. <br>
NAOMI: I thought the point was to finish the puzzle. <br>
ICHEB: And learn something about genetics. <br>
NAOMI: If you really want to help, find me a green piece that looks
like Tuvok's ear. <br>(Chakotay enters.)<br>
ICHEB: Commander. <br>
CHAKOTAY: At ease. I'm just passing through. <br>
ICHEB: I apologise for the condition of the Cargo Bay, sir. I've been
tutoring Naomi. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Looks like you found a creative approach. <br>(Chakotay opens a case.)<br>
ICHEB: Thank you, but I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell Seven. I'm
supposed to be writing a paper on transwarp instability. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Don't worry, your secret's safe, as long as you keep mine. <br>(Chakotay takes a slim bottle from the case.)<br>
ICHEB: Sir? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Antarian cider. Not the replicated stuff. There are only a
couple of bottles left and I don't want Mister Neelix getting his hands
on them. <br>
ICHEB: Then you should store them with the salvaged Borg components.
Neelix never inventories those containers. He says they give him the
creeps. <br>

EMH: You had the liver of an eighty year old man, and the kidneys of a
twelve year old boy. Fortunately, I was able to create a
chronoton-infused serum that brought you back into temporal alignment.
Anywhere else, that antidote would've earned me a prestigious award. Of

somehow been thrown seven years into Voyager's past. <br>

assigned to capture you, and you managed to get on board to sabotage
her. <br>

EMH: How many of these time periods are there? <br>

over the ship. <br>

zone into another. That serum you gave me. It must've made me immune.

to make the serum? <br>

CHAKOTAY: So you're saying no one on your crew has encountered any of
these temporal barriers? <br>
JANEWAY: My helmsman disappeared when she tried to walk down that
corridor, but that doesn't prove she passed through a temporal barrier.
<br>
CHAKOTAY: If you inject yourself, I can take you down that corridor and
show you everything I've said is true. <br>

this is poison and Mister Chakotay is trying to assassinate me. <br>(Chakotay grabs Janeway and uses her as a shield.)<br>

been fractured into different timeframes. <br>
ADULT NAOMI: Thirty seven to be exact. <br>
JANEWAY: How did you calculate that? <br>
ADULT NAOMI: We've had seventeen years to upgrade the sensors. A
chrono-kinetic surge interacted with the warp core. <br>
ADULT ICHEB: It shattered the space-time continuum aboard the ship. <br>
JANEWAY: The accident that occurred in your timeframe. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The question is, can we repair the damage? <br>
JANEWAY: If we could get to a section of the ship that still exists in
that time period, maybe we could counteract the surge, stop it from
happening. <br>
ADULT ICHEB: That section was the focal point of the surge. It seems to
have been obliterated. <br>

Maybe you'd better fill me in. <br>
CHAKOTAY: This looks like the time you forged a temporary alliance with
the Borg. <br>
SEVEN: What's happened to this vessel?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain Janeway, meet Seven of Nine, tertiary adjunct of
Unimatrix zero one. <br>
SEVEN: When a Borg cube travels trough a transwarp corridor, the
temporal stresses are extreme. To keep the different sections of the
Cube in temporal sync, we project a chronoton field throughout the
vessel. <br>
JANEWAY: How? <br>
SEVEN: Each Cube has specially designed conduits. If we install similar
conduits throughout this vessel, then generate a sufficiently powerful
field, we may be able to force Voyager back into temporal sync. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Temporal sync with what? <br>
SEVEN: The vessel will return to the moment of the original
chrono-kinetic surge. Since the surge will last for six or seven
seconds, Commander Chakotay will have a short time in which he could
try to counteract the warp core reaction. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Even if we could replicate these conduits, we'd have no way
to get them through the temporal barriers. <br>
JANEWAY: Bioneural circuitry. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: It runs through every section of the ship, almost like a
nervous system. If we could inject the gel packs with your serum, we
could use them to transmit the chronoton field. <br>
SEVEN: The warp core could be recalibrated to generate that field. <br>
JANEWAY: Work on it. Chakotay and I will see about modifying the serum.
<br>
SEVEN: Your plan is inefficient. <br>
JANEWAY: Why? <br>
SEVEN: There are only two of you. If I were to assimilate you into a
small Borg Collective, you could then assimilate others. The work would
proceed more rapidly.<br>
JANEWAY: Sorry, but I like my plan better. We'll be back. </font></p>

quite a knack for dealing with the Borg. <br>
JANEWAY: You mean we're going to be seeing more of them? <br>
CHAKOTAY: We'll run into them on a few occasions. <br>
JANEWAY: Why do I get the feeling that's an understatement? It doesn't
seem like my first command is shaping up the way I expected. <br>
CHAKOTAY: In the middle of the journey of our life, I found myself
astray in a dark wood, where the straight road had been lost. <br>
JANEWAY: I didn't know Dante's Inferno was on the Maquis reading list. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Actually, I borrowed your copy. <br>
JANEWAY: My fiancé gave me that book as an engagement gift. I've never
lent it to anyone. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Not yet. Anyway, I agree with Dante. If you always see the
road ahead of you, it's not worth the trip. <br>

CHAKOTAY: It's called black and white. It's one of Tom Paris' Holodeck
programmes. He based it on some old science fiction serials. <br>
JANEWAY: Interesting technology. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain Proton's rocketpack. <br>
JANEWAY: Captain Proton? <br>
CHAKOTAY: The Saviour of the Universe. <br>
JANEWAY: Doesn't sound like Mister Paris' tastes are very
sophisticated. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's why we love having him around. The access port should
be in there. <br>(The cave turns out to be Chaotica's secret laboratory.<br>
JANEWAY: Here. I think I found the panel. Give me a hand. <br>(They move some small rocks.)<br>
LONZAK: Halt, in the name of Chaotica! Seize them! <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, no. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Computer, deactivate programme. <br>
COMPUTER: Unable to comply. <br>
ROBOT: Surrender. <br>
COMPUTER: Holodeck controls are offline. <br>
JANEWAY: Hold on. Now wait a minute.&nbsp;<br>
LONZAK: Thieves, my liege. <br>(Satan's Robot grabs Janeway from behind, pinning her arms.)<br>
ROBOT:&nbsp;Do not resist. <br>
LONZAK: They were attempting to rob your laboratory. <br>
CHAOTICA: Fool! Don't you recognise the Queen of the Spider People?
Arachnia, my bride. I knew you'd return to me one day, so I could watch
you die. <br>(Prolonged maniacal laughter. Lonzak joins in. Janeway rolls her eyes. A short time later, she is tied to a metal bed.) <br>CHAOTICA: Raise the Lightning Shield! Power the
Death Ray! Her fleet may be lurking nearby! We must defend ourselves. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm open to suggestions. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Our best bet is to play along. <br>
JANEWAY: Don't let me stop you. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm not the one he's in love with. <br>(Chaotica holds up a vial of chrono-serum.)<br>
CHAOTICA: Arachnia, you beguiled me once with your foul potions. Did
you think you could toy with my affections again? <br>
JANEWAY: Were these characters always this ridiculous? <br>
CHAOTICA: If I order Lonzak to pull that lever, you'll never mock me
again. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Arachnia. <br>
JANEWAY: Please, my liege. I meant it as ridiculous to think I would
ever try to deceive you. I've come to warn you of a fiendish plot.<br>
CHAKOTAY: By aliens from the Eighth Dimension. <br>
CHAOTICA: Eighth? Everyone knows there are only five dimensions. <br>
JANEWAY: If you don't believe us, examine their handiwork for yourself.
There's a hidden panel over there behind those rocks. <br>
CHAOTICA: Very well. I'll humour you. Lonzak! <br>
LONZAK: I've found it, Highness. <br>
CHAOTICA: They've sabotaged my laboratory. <br>
JANEWAY: That vial you're holding, it's a neutralising potion. If you
inject their device, you'll render it harmless. <br>(Chaotica injects the gel pack.)<br>JANEWAY: Release me, and I'll
disarm all their devices, throughout your realm. <br>
CHAOTICA: Oh, Arachnia, you do love me. <br>
JANEWAY: How could I resist your magnetism? <br>
CHAOTICA: Or I yours. Together we'll rule the cosmos and grind our
enemies into dust.<br>(Chaotica kisses her hand, then works his way passionately up her arm.)

CHAKOTAY: It's a little complicated. <br>
TORRES: I'm not going anywhere. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Voyager's had an encounter with an anomaly. It's fractured
the ship into different time periods. <br>
JANEWAY: We're trying to undo the damage, but we need access to that

TORRES: First she destroys our only way out of the Delta Quadrant, and
now you're collaborating with her? <br>

JANEWAY: What reasons? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You were trying to save lives. <br>

PARIS: How did you get in here? <br>
CHAKOTAY: There isn't time to explain. <br>
JANEWAY: What happened to these people? <br>
PARIS: Radiation poisoning. The EPS relays overloaded when we ran into
the anomaly. We need the Doctor and medical supplies, or we're going to
have a lot more casualties. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm afraid that isn't possible right now. Do the best you

JANEWAY: I can't let this happen. Not again. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What are you talking about?<br>
JANEWAY: Voyager getting stranded. All these deaths, this entire
future, it's my fault. I've got to do something to change it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What do you have in mind? <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe we can find a way to modify Seven of Nine's plan. Put
Voyager into temporal sync with my timeframe. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Now that I know what to expect, I could avoid getting trapped
in the Delta Quadrant in the first place. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Halt turbolift. Seven's plan is dangerous enough. Trying to
alter it is too risky. <br>
JANEWAY: It's worth the risk. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If Seven's idea works, Tuvok and the other crewman will be
fine. <br>
JANEWAY: They'll still be stuck in the Delta Quadrant. If the temporal
anomaly doesn't kill them, something else will. The Borg, telepathic
pitcher plants, macroviruses. The Delta Quadrant is a
death-trap. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What about the Temporal Prime Directive? <br>
JANEWAY: To hell with it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: With all due respect, it's a little presumptuous to think you
have the right to change everyone's future.<br>
JANEWAY: From what I've seen, they'll thank me. <br>
CHAKOTAY: All you've seen are bits and pieces. You're not getting the
whole picture. <br>
JANEWAY: Really? Just what am I missing? <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's not what, it's who. People like Seven of Nine, a Borg
Drone who'll become a member of this crew after you help her recover
her humanity. Or Tom Paris, a former convict, who'll be our pilot, chief
medic, and husband to B'Elanna Torres. <br>
JANEWAY: That angry woman I just met? <br>
CHAKOTAY: She's going to be your Chief Engineer. Two crews, Maquis and
Starfleet, are going to become one. And they'll make as big a mark on
the Delta Quadrant as it'll make on them by protecting people like the
Ocampans, curing diseases, encouraging peace. Children like Naomi and
Icheb are going to grow up on this ship and call it home. And we'll all
be following a Captain who sets a course for Earth, and never stops
believing that we'll get there. <br>
JANEWAY: Are you going to be lecturing me like this for the next seven
years?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Don't worry, you'll always get the last word. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
So, who is this Seska? <br>
CHAKOTAY: She was a member of my crew, who turned out to be a
Cardassian spy. She made an alliance with the Kazon and took over the
ship. It's all right, we got it back. <br>
JANEWAY: Sounds like she's not going to be as cooperative as the
others. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I suggest we take a page from your rule book. We try
diplomacy. <br>
JANEWAY: Fine. But the next page in that book says that when diplomacy
fails, we need a backup plan. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CHAKOTAY:
We've already injected the gel packs in the other timeframes. That
just leaves the ones here. It's in both our interests to work together.
<br>
SESKA: I agree. Let him go. <br>
RULAT: You believe him? <br>
SESKA: His story is too preposterous to be a lie. I'll admit it's an
ingenious solution. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm glad you're cooperating. <br>
SESKA: Oh, I believe in cooperation, as long as it benefits me. You
know, it's true what they say. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What's that? <br>
SESKA: Men just get more distinguished as they get older. A few lines
here, a little grey there. It adds character. Too bad their minds start
to go. The last time you were here you had that nasty head injury, and
you mumbled something about my taking over the ship five years ago. If
that's true, then you're from a future time frame, which means that at
some point, your crew is going to regain control of Voyager. I can't
allow that to happen. Step away from the console. <br>(A Kazon drags Chakotay away.)<br>SESKA: It's an ingenious
plan. It just needs a slight modification. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What are you doing? <br>
SESKA: Recalibrating your pulse to bring the ship into temporal sync
with my time frame. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's not possible. <br>
SESKA: When will you learn to stop underestimating me? <br>
CHAKOTAY: If you make even the slightest miscalculation you'll destroy
the ship and kill everyone. <br>
SESKA: What other choice do I have? If I can get Voyager into my own
timeframe, then I'll be able to ensure that you never retake the ship.
Don't worry, I won't hurt you. You can start fresh with me. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Sorry, that's not the future I have in mind. <br>
SESKA: In that case. <br>(She nods to the Kazon to ready their weapons.)<br>SESKA: Goodbye, Chakotay. <br>
(Janeway, Paris and Kim are watching from the upper level.)&nbsp;<br>
CHAKOTAY: It's too dangerous. There are too many variables. <br>
SESKA: You're not pleading for your life, are you? <br>
JANEWAY: Do it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm telling you, you're endangering your own life. <br>
SESKA: I'm touched by your concern. <br>
(Paris and Kim jump &nbsp;down onto the Kazon and fight with them.
Chakotay goes to the panel. Icheb and Naomi enter. Naomi works another
control panel and consoles blow up in front of the remaining Kazon.
Paris throws a rifle to Janeway as she comes down in the lift. Torres,
Ayala and other Maquis come to join the fight.&nbsp;Seska grabs Janeway
from behind and uses her as a shield.)<br>
SESKA: Stop! Put down your weapons. <br>(A Kazon snatches the rifle from Janeway.)<br>
JANEWAY: Don't listen to her. <br>
SESKA: Oh, your faithful First Officer isn't going to let you die. Are
you? (Chakotay lowers his weapon, and Icheb hands his to a Kazon. Another is taken from Torres.)<br>SESKA: Very clever, Chakotay, inoculating them with your serum. Now it's
time to inoculate my people so we can have access to the rest of the
ship. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I won't do that. <br>
SESKA: Then you just lost your Captain. <br>(Borg Seven of Nine enters. Seska shoots at her but the beam bounces off. Seven quickly disarms her.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Now drop your weapons. <br>
JANEWAY: Thanks. <br>(A short time later.)<br>TORRES:
Seska and the Kazon are secure in the Jefferies Tube. The last gel
packs? <br>
CHAKOTAY: They're ready. <br>
JANEWAY: The rest of us should return to our sections. After Chakotay
initiates the warp pulse, he should find himself back at the moment
Voyager encountered the chrono-kinetic surge. He's only going to have a few
seconds to reset the deflector polarity. If the time line is restored,
the rest of us should have no memory of what's happened here. So I'd
like to thank you now for putting your doubts aside, and helping me put
mine aside as well. Good luck to each of you. <br>(Everyone leaves.)<br>
JANEWAY: Mind if I ask you one last question? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Will I have to break the Temporal Prime Directive to answer
it? <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe, just a little. For two people who started off as
enemies, it seems we get to know each other pretty well. So I've been
wondering. Just how close do we get? <br>

Forget particle fountains and subspace inversions. There isn't an

you're six years old. I remember watching a bolt of lightning split an
oak tree in my grandfather's yard. I'd climbed it just a few hours
before. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Good timing. <br>
JANEWAY: So what would've happened if you hadn't turned our deflector
dish into a lightning rod? <br>
CHAKOTAY: We've been down this road before. <br>
JANEWAY: Have we? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You wanting answers to questions you shouldn't ask. <br>
JANEWAY: But something did happen, outside the normal space time
continuum. It's strange, thinking there's a piece of your life you don't
know anything about. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Sounds a lot like the future.<br>
JANEWAY: Any predictions? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Only that in a few minutes this bottle will be empty. <br>
JANEWAY: Then maybe you should go to the Cargo Bay, grab another
one. <br>
