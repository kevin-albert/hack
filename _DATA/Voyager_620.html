TUVOK: You wished to see me. <br>
JANEWAY: We've known each other for how long?<br>
TUVOK: Approximately twenty years. <br>
JANEWAY: We've served on three starships together. I was present at
your daughter's Kohlinar. I consider you one of my closest friends.<br>
TUVOK: And I regard you with the same esteem. <br>
JANEWAY: I've always been honest with you, but you've been keeping
something from me. <br>
TUVOK: I don't know what you mean. <br>
JANEWAY: Don't you? It took exhaustive research, sifting through
teraquads of data, separating fact from rumour, but eventually I
arrived at the truth. <br>
TUVOK: Captain? <br>(She activates the replicator, and turns around holding a blue-iced cake with a single lit candle.)<br>
JANEWAY: Happy birthday. <br>
TUVOK: Thank you. <br>
JANEWAY: So, it's not long before you hit the big three digits, huh? <br>
TUVOK: Indeed. Have you informed anyone else of your discovery? <br>
JANEWAY: Don't worry, Tuvok, my lips are sealed. Well? You're supposed
to blow out the candle. <br>
TUVOK: That is not a Vulcan custom. <br>

EMH: Ah. Pyong Ko. <br>
KES: Excuse me? <br>
EMH: You encouraged me to choose a name, remember? Pyong Ko was a
twenty first century surgeon who discovered the genetic sequence for
inhibiting cancer cells. It heralded a new chapter in Earth's medical
history. <br>
KES: That's a perfect name, Doctor. <br>
EMH: Then again, I'm also considering Schweitzer, Jarvik, Pasteur.
There are so many options, each with its own merits. <br>
KES: Why don't you give it some more thought? You don't have to decide
right away. <br>
EMH: Of course, it's not that I require one for reasons of vanity. I'm
just a hologram after all. But if I had a name, other than Doctor or

Neelix, if you want to put your own stamp on it, maybe you should give

in mind. Sweeting, What'll it be? The usual? <br>

coffee. <br>
NEELIX: That's very thoughtful. I'm looking forward to tonight. <br>
KES: Actually, I have a lot of work to do in Sickbay. <br>
NEELIX: But I already reserved the holodeck. I thought we could take a
moonlit stroll through the marshlands of Oshionian Prime. <br>

That last attack nearly cost us our impulse drives. Fortunately,
B'Elanna found a way to reroute power from the deflector. <br>
JANEWAY: A good choice for Chief Engineer, if I do say so myself. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Getting to know your enemy. <br>
JANEWAY: I feel like I already do. Remember the old story? Man goes
to Risa, where he meets a beautiful woman who invites him over for an
evening of passion. <br>
CHAKOTAY: He wakes up in the morning, feeling wonderful, until he
discovers he's missing a kidney. <br>
JANEWAY: Every cadet about to go on his first shore leave hears that
cautionary tale. Doesn't seem so outrageous anymore, does it? <br>
CHAKOTAY: No, but the Vidiians are more than just your garden variety
monsters. I've been studying their culture. They were a lot like us
before the Phage. <br>
JANEWAY: Do I detect a note of sympathy? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Makes you wonder what we'd do under the same circumstances. <br>
JANEWAY: Come in. (Kes enters with the coffee.)<br>JANEWAY: Oh, you read my mind. <br>(Chakotay leaves. Kes sees the file on the desk computer.)<br>
KES: Vidiians? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm afraid so. We've picked up two more ships on long range
sensors. I've gone to full tactical alert. We're taking every precaution. <br>
KES: I'm sure you'll get us through it safely.<br>
JANEWAY: Thanks for the vote of confidence. Tuvok thinks he's found a
way to penetrate their shields. The next time they attack us, it won't
be so easy. <br>
KES: That's good to hear. <br>
TUVOK [OC]: Captain to the bridge. <br>
JANEWAY: On my way. <br>(Kes spills some coffee.)<br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TUVOK:
Ensign Wildman has an intriguing proposal. <br>
WILDMAN: We've been analysing the Vidiian bio-readings from the last
attack. Their immune systems have been compromised by the Phage. We
could synthesise a neural agent that would incapacitate them without
affecting us. <br>
JANEWAY: Might come in handy if we're ever boarded. <br>
WILDMAN: Exactly. <br>(Tuvok watches Kes leave the ready room. Their eyes meet for a few seconds before Kes goes into the turbolift.)<br>

deploy it through the environmental systems. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TUVOK:
The ships we detected earlier have disappeared from our sensors. <br>
KIM: Maybe we outran them. <br>
TORRES: They wouldn't give up that easily. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: Why would they? Voyager's the only organ bank within
half a parsec.<br>
CHAKOTAY: We fought off their first attacks. Now they seem content to
show up on sensors just long enough for us to change course. It's like
we're being herded somewhere. <br>
PARIS: If we maintain our present course we're going to enter a region
filled with subspace vacuoles. <br>
TORRES: We'd have to drop to impulse to get through. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Sounds like a good place for an ambush. <br>
TORRES: The Maquis used to lure the Cardassians into the Badlands.
Those Galor class cruisers had nowhere to run. <br>
JANEWAY: Neither will we, unless. Tom, how dense are those vacuoles? <br>
PARIS: They cover about seventy percent of the region. <br>
JANEWAY: Excuse me, Doctor. <br>(Janeway replaces the EMH with a map of the upcoming area.)<br>JANEWAY:&nbsp;Tom, what's the first thing they teach you
about
manoeuvring at warp? <br>
PARIS: Faster than light, no left or right. When possible, maintain a
linear trajectory. Course corrections could fracture the hull. <br>
JANEWAY: Exactly. We'd have to drop to impulse every time we made a
course change but, what if we let Voyager do the driving? <br>
PARIS: Ma'am? <br>
JANEWAY: We could pre-programme every kilometre. That way we'd only
spend a second or two at impulse every time the computer executed a
turn. <br>
PARIS: Auto-navigation the entire way?<br>
JANEWAY: No offence, but the neural gel packs can calculate vectors a
little faster than you can. <br>
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna? <br>
TORRES: We'd need a more accurate scan of the region. If we even graze
one of those vacuoles<br>
KIM: We could send a shuttle ahead. <br>
TUVOK: The Delta Flyer. Its sensors are more advanced. <br>
JANEWAY: The Delta what?<br>
TUVOK: Forgive me. I must have been thinking of another starship. <br>
JANEWAY: Prepare a shuttle. I want all of Voyager's systems operating
at peak efficiency by the time Tom gets back. If we're going to pull
this off, there's no margin for error. Dismissed.

of days? Hallucinations, premonitions? <br>

which systems to target. <br>

malfunctioning. They're both reading as Kes. <br>

Now one of you doesn't belong here, and I'm guessing it's you. Tuvok's
premonitions were real. You're from the future. <br>

JANEWAY: You're helping the Vidiians, Kes. Why? <br>(Kes
telekinetically throws Janeway against the bulkhead. She heads for the
doors and they open to reveal Federation and Vidiian weapons fire
criss-crossing it. Kes retreats and Janeway regains her weapon and her
feet.) <br>JANEWAY: Tell me
why you're doing this. <br>
KES: I won't let you hurt her again. <br>
JANEWAY: I haven't done anything to harm her. <br>(Kes lays her other self on the floor.)<br>
KES: You took her from Ocampa, her home. She's a prisoner on this ship.<br>
JANEWAY: No one's a prisoner here, Kes. <br>

Hull polarity loosened their hold, but not by much. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's a start. Reroute the deflector. Have it discharge
anti-graviton pulses along the hull. Engage the inertial dampers. Get a

three years, I'm going to leave Voyager in search of higher things
because you encouraged me to do it. You encouraged me to develop my
mental abilities. I wasn't ready for what I found. I couldn't control
it. It scared me. I had nowhere to go. I thought of returning home to
Ocampa, but I'd changed too much. I knew they'd be frightened of me. I
knew they wouldn't accept me, but they'll accept her. <br>

TUVOK: She had her hands on the casing, as if she was drawing energy
from it. <br>
JANEWAY: The tachyons are concentrated here. It's possible she needed
the core to travel back in time. <br>
TUVOK: If that's true, then she'll need it again. <br>

willing to hand the rest of us over to the Vidiians to do it. It didn't
