48532.4. We're on our way to a rogue planetoid which Mister Neelix
tells us is an extremely rich source of raw dilithium. If he's right,
this could go a long way toward easing our power shortage. </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Assuming we do find dilithium on this planetoid, we're going
to need a refining facility on the ship to process it.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Lieutenant Torres has already asked permission to start
modifications to the auxiliary impulse reactor. It could be converted
into a crude dilithium refinery.<br>
JANEWAY: The impulse reactor? Sometimes I think B'Elanna goes out of
her way to find solutions that ignore Starfleet procedures.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Her arguments are quite convincing. She thinks it can be done
safely.<br>
JANEWAY: I'm sure it can. Tell her I want regular reports on her
progress every step of the way. Are you sure you won't join me for
breakfast? I was thinking of having eggs Benedict with asparagus,
strawberries and cream. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Ah. <br>
JANEWAY: I said I was thinking about it. I'm actually having ration
pack number five. Stewed tomatoes with dehydrated eggs.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Mmm. Sounds delicious, but I've already had my vacuum-packed
oatmeal this morning.<br>
JANEWAY: I'll see you on the bridge. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Mess
hall - kitchen]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
(Captain Janeway walks through the door into a steam-filled room, and
her jaw drops open. Neelix has a pair of large pans sizzling away on
blazing braziers. He seasons them, then puts some food onto a metal
tray and hands it to a crewman across a serving counter.) <br>
NEELIX: Hope you enjoy it.<br>
JANEWAY: What is going on here?<br>
NEELIX: Captain, you caught me by surprise.<br>
JANEWAY: I could say the same thing. What are you doing?<br>
NEELIX: Well, I know how you and the other senior officers have been,
excuse me, disappointed with the rations lately, so I thought I'd use a
few of the vegetables from the hydroponics bay and whip up a little
breakfast.<br>
JANEWAY: You have turned this into a galley?<br>
NEELIX: It wasn't easy. I had to completely re-route the mess hall
power conduits and scrounge a lot of supplies from all over the ship,
but that's my specialty, making something out of nothing. I know it
doesn't look like much now, but in a few days you'll swear there'd been
a galley here for years. Be careful, that one is a little spicy.<br>
JANEWAY: Neelix, who approved this?<br>
NEELIX: Ah, well, no one.<br>
JANEWAY: Well, you might have asked me first. This used to be my
private dining room.<br>
NEELIX: Your? Your dining room?<br>
JANEWAY: If you had checked the ship's directory, you would have
noticed that cabin one two five alpha deck two is designated as the
Captain's private dining room.<br>
NEELIX: Oh! Then I guess that you'll be wanting me to move all of this
stuff out of your way. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Bridge to Captain Janeway.<br>
JANEWAY: Go ahead.<br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: We're approaching the rogue planetoid, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: On my way. I want you to come with me. We will deal with this
later.<br>
NEELIX: Ensign Parsons, would you mind keeping an eye on things until I
get back and er, rotate the darvot fritters every ten minutes until
they turn a deep chartreuse. And remember one, one to a customer. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]
</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: What have you found?<br>
KIM: We're picking up definite dilithium signatures, Captain. The
strongest readings are originating from ten to twenty kilometres inside
the planetoid.<br>
TORRES: It also looks like there's a series of subterranean caves with
an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Class M. It'll make mining a lot easier if we can go in there
without environmental suits.<br>
JANEWAY: How much dilithium are we talking about?<br>
TORRES: It's hard to get a precise reading. It could be anywhere from
five hundred to one thousand metric tonnes.<br>
NEELIX: Just as I said. I bet there are a few Yallitaian engineers
who'd give all three of their spinal columns to know where this planet
is.<br>
JANEWAY: Commander, take an away team down into those caves and do a
preliminary geological analysis. Lieutenant, you'd better get your
dilithium refinery on-line.<br>
TORRES: It'll be ready to go in three days.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Ensign Kim. <br>
(Neelix moves to join Chakotay and Kim.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Where are you going?<br>
NEELIX: With you. I've been studying my tricorder operations manual.
Lieutenant Torres has brought me up to date on dilithium geophysics.
I've been preparing for this mission all week.<br>
JANEWAY: Very well, Mister Neelix.<br>
(Neelix joins Chakotay and Kim in the turbolift.) <br>
NEELIX: I think you'll find me extremely helpful, Commander. I remember
the first time I flew past this planet, it was about three years ago <br>
KIM: Deck four. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>
[Planetoid]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
CHAKOTAY: It looks like there are several large deposits in this
general vicinity. Let's split up and begin taking geological scans.
Keep your comm. channels open at all times and don't wander too far.
Stay within a fifty metre radius of this position. <br>
(The three take different tunnels. They don't notice their beam in site
transform into a constructed tunnel with pipes along the wall, and a
humanoid step into it.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Kim.<br>
KIM [OC]: Go ahead.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm still picking up dilithium signatures but there are no
dilithium formations here. Have you found anything yet? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Tunnel
2]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
I'm running a geo-strato analysis of the rock in this vicinity. So far
there's no indication of any dilithium.<br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Keep looking. </font></p>

Neelix to Commander Chakotay.<br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Go ahead.<br>
NEELIX: I think I've found something. A large cavern approximately
twenty metres from my position. I'm reading a huge dilithium formation
there.<br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Don't go any further </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> NEELIX:
But it's right here. I'm in the cavern now, Commander, but I don't
understand this.<br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Let me guess, nothing there.<br>
NEELIX: Not so much as a sliver of dilithium, and yet according to my
readings I should be surrounded by it.<br>
CHAKOTAY: All right, I've had enough </font></p>

CHAKOTAY [OC]: Rendezvous at the<br>
NEELIX: Wait a minute. I'm getting unusual readings from this rock
face. Traces of organic energy. Looks like a bio-electrical signature.
I think there's something alive down here. It's about two metres into
this rock face.<br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Neelix, I said get back here! Neelix, did you hear what
I said?<br>
NEELIX: Just one minute, Commander. <br>
(The rock face behind Neelix transforms into a tunnel. A figure sees
Neelix and hides. Neelix turns and sees the constructed tunnel.) <br>
NEELIX: Hello? Is there someone there? Hello? I know there's somebody.<br>
(The somebody zaps Neelix with an energy weapon.) </font></p>

find Neelix writhing on the floor.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: I can't be certain, but I think he's going into shock.
Chakotay to Voyager, medical emergency. Beam us directly to sickbay. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>
[Sickbay]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Kim
and Chakotay hold Neelix down on the biobed while the EMH scans
him.)&nbsp;<br>
EMH: Get the blood-gas infuser.<br>
CHAKOTAY: The what?<br>
EMH: Equipment storage unit two, second shelf on the left. Now! <br>
(Chakotay goes for the equipment.) <br>
EMH: Hold him still.<br>
(The EMH tranquillises Neelix.) <br>
KIM: What's happening, Doctor?<br>
EMH: He's going into a coma. <br>
(Chakotay returns with the small device.) <br>
EMH: The infuser will keep his oxygen levels stable for the next hour
or so, but after that he'll die. His lungs have been removed.<br>
(A little later, Paris is moving equipment around and Janeway is being
brought up to date.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: By the time we got to him he was unconscious.<br>
JANEWAY: How could anyone remove his organs so quickly?<br>
CHAKOTAY: The Doctor says whoever did this used some kind of
transporter to beam the lungs directly out of his body.<br>
(Kes enters.) <br>
KES: What happened?<br>
JANEWAY: It appears that Neelix was attacked. We don't know how it
happened, but someone has surgically removed his lungs. <br>
(Kes goes to Neelix's bedside.) <br>
JANEWAY: Did you find any evidence of the life sign that Neelix
reported?<br>
CHAKOTAY: No.<br>
KIM: Captain, I've analysed the sensor logs from Neelix's tricorder.
The bio-scanner picked up a single class three humanoid organism.<br>
EMH: The blood gas infuser will keep him alive for another forty seven
minutes. The only chance for his survival I see at the moment is to get
his own lungs back.<br>
JANEWAY: Can't we fit him with a pair of artificial lungs?<br>
EMH: His respiratory system is directly linked to multiple points along
his spinal column. It's too complex to replicate. I may be able to
surgically reattach the organs if we get them back. In the meantime
I'll have to search for other options.<br>
JANEWAY: Commander, I'm taking an away team back to the planet. You're
in charge until we return. Inform Mister Tuvok I want three armed
security detachments to accompany us. Issue type three phasers.<br>
(Janeway, Chakotay and Kim leave.) <br>
EMH: Mister Paris, did they teach you how to run a respiratory series
in your bio-chemistry classes at the Academy?<br>
PARIS: No, I'm afraid they didn't.<br>
EMH: Fine, I'll run it myself. Get me a pulmonary scanner. (to Kes) I'm
going to have to ask you to leave.<br>
KES: I'm not leaving.<br>
EMH: All right, just keep out of the way. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Cavern]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
Here it is. This is where Neelix was standing when he was attacked.
According to his tricorder log he was scanning this rock face when he
detected the life sign.<br>
JANEWAY: Neelix said there was a life sign two metres behind this wall,
but my tricorder says there's nothing but solid rock for another
fifteen metres.<br>
KIM: Sounds like our tricorders aren't giving us the real picture
behind what's going on here.<br>
JANEWAY: Wait a minute. The rock is warmer here.<br>
KIM: You're right, Captain. There's a two degree differential in this
section of the wall.<br>
TUVOK: There are no natural geological phenomena that could be creating
this heat source.<br>
JANEWAY: Let's make a little heat of our own.<br>
(The four line up in the cavern entrance and fire phasers at the rock
face. The tunnel appears.) <br>
TUVOK: There was a highly sophisticated forcefield in place.<br>
JANEWAY: There's a chamber down this corridor. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]
</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PARIS:
Doc, I think his cellular toxicity level is rising.<br>
EMH: It's up to thirty two percent. Lets see if we can stabilise those
levels. Get me a cytoplasmic stimulator.<br>
PARIS: We don't have one.<br>
EMH: Then replicate one. (Paris hesitates) The design schematics are in
the ship's medical database. <br>
PARIS: Right. <br>
(Paris leaves.) <br>
EMH: The man drives a seven hundred thousand ton starship so somebody
thinks he'd make a good medic.<br>
KES: I can survive with one lung, can't I? What if I donated a lung to
Neelix?<br>
EMH: A transplant is not an option. No one on board is a compatible
match for a Talaxian. <br>
(The EMH walks past his office to where Paris is using the replicator.)
<br>
EMH: We're going to need a completely new way to oxygenate his blood
supply and relay neuro-electrical impulses. Our replicators can't
produce compatible artificial organs for him, but maybe there's a way
to mimic their functions and give us direct control of his respiratory
system. Computer, is there an identification matrix on Mister Neelix
from the last time he used the transporter?<br>
COMPUTER: Affirmative.<br>
EMH: Transfer it to console four.<br>
(Paris and the EMH return to the ward.) <br>
PARIS: What are you doing?<br>
EMH: I'm using the transporter matrix to get exact specifications for
Neelix's lungs.<br>
PARIS: I thought you just said we can't replicate his lungs.<br>
EMH: We can't. But if I can reconfigure my emitter array I might be
able to create a pair of holographic lungs for Mister Neelix.<br>
PARIS: Holographic lungs?<br>
EMH: If it's successful, we can precisely control his pulmonary
functions to allow normal breathing.<br>
PARIS: But a hologram is just a projection of light held in a magnetic
containment field. There's no real matter involved.<br>
(The EMH slaps Paris.) <br>
EMH: Now, you hit me. <br>
(Paris's hand passes through the EMH's head.) <br>
EMH: The magnetic containment field that creates the illusion of my
body can be modulated to allow matter to pass through it or be stopped.
I might be able to modulate the holographic lungs in the same way,
allowing oxygen and carbon dioxide to pass from the lungs to the blood
stream.<br>
KES: I want to know what this means. What are you going to do to him?<br>
EMH: There's no time to explain the exact procedure to you right now.<br>
KES: Oh, you'll make the time, because I'm not going to let you perform
any experimental surgery on Neelix until I know exactly what you're
doing and what the risks are.<br>
EMH: The risk is that it won't work, and if it doesn't he'll die. But
it is his only immediate chance for survival. If he does survive, he'll
have to be held motionless in an isotropic restraint. The lungs need to
be perfectly aligned to his internal physiology. The computer won't be
able to compensate for any body movement whatsoever.<br>
KES: How long will he have to stay like that?<br>
EMH: For the rest of his life, unless the holo-lungs can be replaced by
his original organs. And he will never be able to leave the holographic
environment of this room. The holo-lungs would disappear the moment he
went out the door.<br>
PARIS: Kes, I know it sounds pretty grim, but it's better than losing
him completely. This way, he'll still be alive, and maybe we can find a
better solution somewhere down the road. What do you think Neelix would
want?<br>
KES: I'm not sure. But I do know that I want him to live. </font></p>

leads the away team down the tunnel. Kim opens the door at the end and
they enter a version of sickbay with a metal operating bed and large
jars holding tissue samples.) <br>
TUVOK: This room is the source of the dilithium signature we detected
earlier. The power systems here are running on an unusual dilithium
matrix.<br>
KIM: So there are actually no dilithium deposits on this planet.<br>
TUVOK: It would appear not.<br>
KIM: Are these organs?<br>
JANEWAY: This looks like some sort of storage facility.<br>
TUVOK: I would say you are correct, Captain. This appears to be a
biological repository.<br>
JANEWAY: Any sign of Neelix's lungs?<br>
TUVOK: Negative. There is however a Kazon liver, and although I cannot
identify the other organs on display here I would say they bear a
striking similarity to pulmonary organs, epidermal tissue, ocular nerve
fibre <br>
JANEWAY: Save the cataloguing for later, Tuvok, according to my
tricorder there was a lifeform in this room less than ten minutes ago.<br>

Captain! We've completed our diagnostic on the alien device. It appears
to be more than a weapon. It's also a very sophisticated medical
scanner and surgical instrument.<br>
TUVOK: From what we can tell, it uses a neural resonator to stun the
victim, while a quantum imaging begins a microcellular analysis of the
entire body.<br>
TORRES: The amount of information this thing can gather puts a
tricorder to shame. You fire this at someone, you learn everything
about their anatomy, right down to their DNA sequencing.<br>
JANEWAY: So it sounds like we're dealing with aliens who've developed a
technology specifically designed to locate and extract organs from
other beings. Why?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain! The alien ship has dropped out of warp. It's
approaching a large asteroid.<br>
JANEWAY: On screen.<br>
PARIS: It's entered the asteroid, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Hold position here. Mister Kim?<br>
KIM: I can't scan the interior. The surface stratum is made up of some
sort of neutronium alloy. It doesn't look like a natural formation.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Are you saying some one built this asteroid?<br>
KIM: It's possible.<br>
JANEWAY: Any sign of weapons or defence systems?<br>
TUVOK: Negative.<br>
PARIS: I think I've located where the alien ship entered. There's an
open crater on the limb of the asteroid.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Let's see it.<br>
PARIS: The ion trail from the alien ship leads directly inside.<br>
JANEWAY: How large is that crater?<br>
PARIS: Two hundred metres in diameter.<br>
TUVOK: Captain, may I suggest you consider carefully what you are about
to do.<br>
JANEWAY: How do you know what I'm about to do?<br>
TUVOK: I could describe to you in detail the psychological observations
I have made about you over the past four years which lead me to
conclude you are about to take this ship inside the asteroid. But
suffice it to say, I know you quite well.<br>
JANEWAY: One of these days I'm going to surprise you, Tuvok, but not
today. I've already considered other options. If Neelix has any chance
of surviving, we have to act fast. Red alert. Mister Paris, lay in a

PARIS: Aye, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok, maximum shields. Phasers at the ready.<br>
(Voyager heads into the crack in the asteroid.) <br>
PARIS: Captain, I'm reducing power to the aft thrusters only. This
passageway is getting a little too narrow for my taste.<br>
JANEWAY: Use your discretion, Mister Paris. Any sign of the vessel,
Lieutenant?<br>
TUVOK: We are still following the ion trail, but electro-magnetic
interference is limiting our sensor range. I am only able to scan five
hundred metres ahead of us.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Are there any indications we're being scanned or probed,
Mister Kim?<br>
KIM: Not yet. </font></p>

NEELIX: Doctor? Doctor, I require your assistance.<br>
EMH: What is it, Mister Neelix?<br>
NEELIX: Please, it's urgent.<br>
EMH: Yes?<br>
NEELIX: I have an itch<br>
EMH: An itch.<br>
NEELIX: Just above my left eyebrow. <br>
(The EMH sighs, and scratches it.) <br>
NEELIX: A little higher. Ah. Thank you.<br>
EMH: You're quite welcome.<br>
NEELIX: Doctor, wait, don't leave.<br>
EMH: I'm not leaving, Mister Neelix, I'm simply going back to work.<br>
NEELIX: I can't see you over there. I feel like I'm all alone.<br>
EMH: You are all alone. I'm a holographic projection. A projection with
a lot of work to do, I might add.<br>
NEELIX: That's very amusing, Doctor. But, I'm really starting to feel a
little trapped in here. A little claustrophobic, maybe. I'm not sure
what to do.<br>
EMH: There's nothing you can do except lie there and be quiet.<br>
NEELIX: I'm going to lie here for the rest of my life, aren't I? Just
staring up at the ceiling. I'm not sure I can take that. I really need
to get out of this restraint. Doctor, I want you to let me out of this
thing right now.<br>
EMH: You know that's impossible.<br>
NEELIX: I'm the patient, I know what my rights are. I want to be
released from this restraint immediately. Immediately!<br>
EMH: Mister Neelix, you are alive. You are breathing and for the moment
your condition is stable. That is more than most people can say in your
situation. Now it is critical to your recovery that you not subject
yourself to any additional stress. Try to calm down.<br>
NEELIX: Don't tell me to calm down! You're not the one trapped in a
restraining field with holo, holo-lungs. I don't think they're working.
I can't, can't get enough oxygen. There's something wrong.<br>
EMH: You're hyperventilating. Try to take slow, natural breaths.<br>
NEELIX: I can't. I'm dying. Let me out of here. Help me. Help me. <br>

JANEWAY: You're doing fine, Mister Paris. Just fine.<br>
PARIS: Thanks, Captain.<br>
TUVOK: Sensors detect a large chamber ahead.<br>
(The chamber seems to be full of ships.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: What the hell?<br>
KIM: We appear to be seeing Voyager and the alien ship reflecting off
the walls of the chamber.<br>
JANEWAY: Can you determine which ship is the real one?<br>
TUVOK: No, Captain. The walls are emanating severe electro-magnetic
interference. I cannot scan them directly.<br>
JANEWAY: It's like trying to move through a hall of mirrors. You never
know when you're going to walk into the glass.<br>
PARIS: I'm still picking up the alien's ion trail. Maybe we should
follow that.<br>
CHAKOTAY: He might have left a fake ion trail to lure us in here. It
could lead us right into one of those walls.<br>
JANEWAY: That's a chance we're going to have to take. Tuvok, extend the
deflectors to maximum range. If we do run into something, it'll give us
an extra margin of error. Follow the ion trail, Mister Paris, slowly.
Mister Kim, continuous scans.<br>
KIM: Aye, Captain. </font></p>

I'll do what I can to reassure him, Doctor.<br>
EMH: Good. If you don't mind I'd like you to remain in sickbay so
you're here when he wakes up.<br>
KES: Of course. Are you all right?<br>
EMH: Me?<br>
KES: You seem agitated about something.<br>
EMH: Of course I'm agitated. This entire situation is getting out of
control.<br>
KES: You mean Neelix.<br>
EMH: First they tell me there's no doctor, so I have to be on call
twenty four hours a day. And then they tell me there are no nurses so I
have no one to assist me.<br>
KES: I thought Tom Paris was assigned to you.<br>
EMH: Like I said, no one to assist me. And now I have a patient with
severe and possibly long term emotional problems and there's no
counsellor on board. I am an emergency medical supplement. A
supplement, that's all. I wasn't programmed for any of this. It's just
unacceptable.<br>
KES: I don't know anything about holographic engineering, but if you
want my opinion, you haven't been acceptable, you've been remarkable.<br>
EMH: I've only done what the programme allows me to.<br>
KES: Give yourself some credit. You saved his life. You did, not some
programme.<br>
EMH: It may seem that way to you.<br>
KES: That's exactly how it seems.<br>
EMH: You're very kind.<br>
KES: How does a real doctor learn to deal with patient's emotional
problems anyway?<br>
EMH: They learn from experience.<br>
KES: Aren't you capable of learning?<br>
EMH: I have the capacity to accumulate and process data, yes.<br>
KES: Then I guess you'll just have to learn like the rest of us.<br>
EMH: Have you ever considered a career in medicine? (beep) Neelix is
starting to regain consciousness. </font></p>

Lieutenant, I'm picking up a minor power fluctuation in the warp core.<br>
TORRES: Compensate with the KLS stabiliser.<br>
SESKA: No effect. In fact, the power loss is starting to accelerate.<br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Janeway to Torres, what's going on down there?<br>
TORRES: Some kind of power drain. I can't localise it but we're losing

KIM: The power drain is coming from somewhere in this chamber, Captain.
It's some kind of dampening field. It's bleeding energy directly from
the warp nacelles.<br>

Distance, five hundred and forty seven metres.<br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok, what would happen if we locked phasers and fired at the
source.<br>
TUVOK: The walls of this chamber reflect directed energy. The phaser
beam would ricochet along an unpredictable path, possibly impacting our
ship in the process.<br>
JANEWAY: All right, we won't try that.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Well, maybe we should. Tuvok, what would happen if we reduced
the phaser power level to a minimum setting and sent out a continuous
beam.<br>
TUVOK: The phaser would continue to reflect off the bulkheads until it
encountered a non-reflective material.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Until it encountered a non-reflective material, like the real
alien ship.<br>
JANEWAY: So we could use the phasers like a searchlight, scan the
interior of the station until we find the ship.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Exactly.<br>
JANEWAY: Do it.<br>
(Lots of orange lines criss-cross the chamber.) <br>
TUVOK: Adjusting phaser azimuth to fifteen degrees.<br>
KIM: Wait a minute. I think I've found the real ship.<br>
JANEWAY: On screen. <br>

JANEWAY: Mister Paris, bring us within transporter range of that ship.<br>
PARIS: Aye, Captain.<br>
KIM: Picking up two life signs.<br>
TUVOK: They are powering engines.<br>
JANEWAY: Bridge to transporter room three. Lock onto those two life
signs and beam them aboard.<br>

JANEWAY: You're on the Starship Voyager. I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway of
the United Federation of Planets.<br>
DERETH: I'm Dereth, of the Vidiian Sodality.<br>
JANEWAY: You attacked one of our crewmembers and you have lured us into
this asteroid. Why?<br>
DERETH: We are gathering replacement organs and suitable bio-matter. It
is the only way we have to fight the phage.<br>
JANEWAY: A virus? Some kind of disease?<br>
MOTURA: Yes, it attacked our people over two millennia ago. It consumes
our bodies, destroys our genetic codes and cellular structures.<br>
JANEWAY: So you harvest the bodies of other beings to replace your own
tissues as they're consumed by this phage?<br>
MOTURA: Our immuno-technology cannot keep up. The phage adapts. It
resists all attempts to destroy it. Our society has been ravaged.
Thousands die each day. There is no other way for us to survive.<br>
JANEWAY: I have a great sympathy for what your race has endured, but I
cannot allow you to keep the organs you removed from one of our crew
members. We need them back immediately.<br>
DERETH: I'm afraid that isn't possible. I have already bio-chemically
altered the air-breathing organs and grafted them into Motura's body.
They are a part of him now.<br>
MOTURA: He is my honatta. His task is to find the organs I need for
survival. We, we try to extract them from the dead <br>
DERETH: But sometimes, when the need is immediate, more aggressive
actions are required.<br>
JANEWAY: So now I am left with the same choice you made. Whether to
commit murder to save a life, or to allow my own crewman to die while
you breath air through his lungs.<br>
MOTURA: It must be impossible for you to understand how any civilised
people could come to this. Before the phage began, we were known as
educators and explorers, a people whose greatest achievements were
artistic. I myself am a sculptor of note on my world. All I can say is
that when your entire existence is at stake <br>
DERETH: You don't have to explain yourself, Motura.<br>
MOTURA: If the consequence of this act is a death sentence, so be it.
At least it will put an end to my suffering.<br>
JANEWAY: I can't begin to understand what your people have gone
through. They may have found a way to ignore the moral implications of
what you are doing, but I have no such luxury. I don't have the freedom
to kill you to save another. My culture finds that to be a
reprehensible and entirely unacceptable act. If we were closer to home
I would lock you up and turn you over to my authorities for trial, but
I don't even have that ability here, and I am not prepared to carry you
forever in our brig. So I see no other alternative but to let you go.
Take a message to your people. If I ever encounter your kind again, I
will do whatever is necessary to protect my people from this harvesting
of yours. Any aggressive actions against this ship or it's crew will be
met by the deadliest force. Is that clear? <br>
DERETH: Quite.<br>
MOTURA: Wait. I want to see this crewman of yours.<br>
DERETH: That can serve no useful purpose.<br>
MOTURA: Maybe it can. Our medical technologies may be superior to
theirs.<br>
JANEWAY: I can tell you, from what we've observed of them, that they
are considerably superior.<br>
MOTURA: She spared my life. Our lives. We owe it to them to see if
there's anything we can do to help him.<br>

(Dereth points it at Tuvok, who is very fast on the draw with his
phaser.) <br>
DERETH: This is set to scan only.<br>
TUVOK: Proceed, carefully.<br>

DERETH: Strange. According to my readings, you are not here. <br>
EMH: Believe me, I wish I weren't. <br>
DERETH: The rest of you are healthy. You are compatible for organ
transplant.<br>
EMH: Wait a minute. We've already considered this. Talaxian physiology
is different from that of anyone else on this ship. His immune system
would reject their lungs immediately.<br>
DERETH: Your surgical knowledge is inferior. We will simply adapt his
immunogenicity. It won't be a problem. Which of you will donate a lung?<br>
KES: Me.<br>
NEELIX: No, absolutely not. It's too dangerous. Let someone else do it.<br>
KES: No, I want to do it, Neelix. I'm willing to take the risk.
Besides, you've done so much for me, let me give you something this
once. Just for once<br>
NEELIX: All right.<br>
JANEWAY: I look forward to sampling your cooking, Mister Neelix.<br>

spoke to the Captain about you. She's given me permission to begin
training you as a medical assistant. You'll be a back-up for Mister
Paris, or possibly a replacement. That is, assuming you're interested.<br>
