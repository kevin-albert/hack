Captain's log, stardate 45761.3. In an effort to bring an end to their
centuries-long war, Krios and Valt Minor have agreed to a Ceremony of
Reconciliation, to be held aboard the Enterprise at a point midway
between their two systems.

Ambassador Briam. We had to stop at Harod Four to pick up a group of
stranded miners. <br>
BRIAM: Please, Captain, we are grateful that the Federation has taken
as much interest as it has in this matter. <br>
PICARD: Was Commander La Forge able to provide you with the special
cargo handling provisions you requested? <br>
BRIAM: Indeed he was. However, until we reach the rendezvous with the
Valtese, may I ask that the cargo bay be declared off-limits to all but
the most essential personnel? <br>
PICARD: I trust, Ambassador, that this cargo is in no way dangerous? <br>
BRIAM: Oh, no, nothing of the sort. I'm cautious because it's quite
fragile, and quite irreplaceable. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Bridge to Captain Picard. <br>
PICARD: Go ahead. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Captain, we've just picked up a distress call from a
Ferengi shuttle. <br>

RIKER [OC]: Aye, sir. <br>

cannot be delayed. <br>

KAMALA: I am for you, Alrik of Valt. <br>
BRIAM: No, Kamala. This is not Alrik. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the Federation Starship Enterprise. <br>
KAMALA: That explains why you don't look at all like your holographs. I
apologise, Captain. As an empath, I could sense your authority. I
assumed you were Chancellor Alrik. <br>
PICARD: I'm afraid I require an explanation, Ambassador. <br>
KAMALA: As do I, Ambassador. Why have I been brought out of stasis
prematurely? <br>
BRIAM: It was an accident. This is quite complicated. Perhaps you and I
<br>
KAMALA: It is not complicated at all, Briam, and the Captain has no
tolerance for prevarication. I'm a gift, to Alrik of Valt. <br>
RIKER: You mean you're using this ship to transport a sentient being as
property? <br>
BRIAM: Not as property, as a gift, and I was concerned that you might
not entirely understand. <br>
PICARD: Your concern was justified, Ambassador. <br>
KAMALA: You're angry. Why? <br>
PICARD: There is a provision in the Federation Constitution that
protects an individual's fundamental rights. Now once you were brought
aboard this ship <br>
KAMALA: You're coming to my rescue. What a kind and generous purpose.
But Captain, I do not need to be rescued. <br>
BRIAM: Kamala is the key to peace between our two worlds. <br>
RIKER: Why? <br>
KAMALA: In our history there's a woman known as Garuth, who was loved
by the brothers Krios and Valt with such passion that an empire fell. <br>
BRIAM: And the wars began when Krios kidnapped Garuth and took her to
our planet. <br>
KAMALA: Like her, I'm an empathic metamorph. The first female metamorph
born in my world for over a hundred years. <br>
PICARD: A metamorph? <br>
KAMALA: A mutant. A biological curiosity, if you will. With the ability
to sense what a potential mate wants, what he needs, what gives him the
greatest pleasure and then to become that for him. <br>
RIKER: You mean you change according to whatever man you're with? <br>
KAMALA: Until I reach the stage of bonding, when I must imprint upon
myself the requirements of one man, to serve as his perfect partner in
life. <br>
BRIAM: You see, male metamorphs are somewhat common, but females are
born only once in seven generations. So obviously they are greatly
sought after as mates. <br>
RIKER: Which explains the Ferengi's interest. <br>
BRIAM: This mating to Alrik was arranged sine her birth by the leaders
of both worlds, in the hopes of restoring peace. <br>
PICARD: You do this of your own accord? <br>
KAMALA: It is my sole purpose in life. <br>
PICARD: Commander Riker, escort her to quarters. There's no need for
you to travel in the cargo bay. <br>
BRIAM: Kamala, remain in your room. I will speak to you shortly.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Why were you in stasis? <br>
KAMALA: Metamorphs have a long and complex sexual maturing process. I
am in the Finiis'ral, the third and final stage. It can be an
uncomfortable transition Not only for me, but for the men around me. <br>
RIKER: In what way? <br>
KAMALA: My body is producing an unusually elevated level of what you
would call pheromones. The effect can be quite provocative. Perhaps you
sense it? <br>
RIKER: Ah, unfortunately, I'm not an empath. <br>
KAMALA: Oh, I think you are more empathic than you admit. At least when
it comes to women. <br>
RIKER: I think you have me at a disadvantage. </font></p>

can just ask the computer, <br>

RIKER: I'm beginning to sense the elevated pheromones you were
referring to. <br>
KAMALA: You were curious, weren't you? <br>
RIKER: Curious isn't exactly how I'd describe it. <br>
KAMALA: Do you know what's remarkable about empathic metamorphs? <br>
RIKER: You mean there's something even more remarkable about you? <br>
KAMALA: We learn so quickly what stimulates a man, that the second
time's even better than the first. <br>
(she initiates another long, long, kiss) <br>
RIKER: Listen. This has been educational but I make it a policy never
to open another man's gift. <br>
KAMALA: I know my role in history, Commander. But it's going to be a
long voyage. <br>

possible.

CRUSHER: How can you simply deliver her like a courier into a life of

PICARD: Beverly! Arranged marriages have been the basis of political
alliances in many cultures, including our own. <br>
CRUSHER: I'm surprised at you. <br>
PICARD: She knows exactly what she's doing. <br>
CRUSHER: She has been conditioned since the day she was born to believe
it's perfectly acceptable to exist only to please men. <br>
PICARD: She was born to do this. <br>
CRUSHER: And bred by those people to seal a treaty with a seductive
coup de grace. <br>
PICARD: All right, fine, good, let's throw the Prime Directive to the
winds. Let's detain her against her will. Let's destroy any chance of
peace between these worlds. Let's interfere in their society, their
customs. <br>
CRUSHER: That slave trader who calls himself an ambassador, he has
confined her to her quarters. She is a virtual prisoner in there. <br>

KAMALA: Yes, I know. This ship's very important to you, isn't it? <br>
PICARD: Oh, yes. Oh, yes, it is. <br>
KAMALA: Are all captains' lives so solitary? Or just yours? <br>
PICARD: Don't. <br>
KAMALA: What? <br>
PICARD: Don't do this, this, this you do with men. <br>
KAMALA: I'm afraid my premature emergence from stasis has left me a
little vulnerable to the desires I sense from men.
Nevertheless, this is who I am, Captain. You might as well ask a Vulcan
to forgo logic, or a Klingon to be nonviolent. I
cannot change, and I don't want to until the time has come for me to
bond with my permanent mate. Why does it bother you? <br>
PICARD: Frankly, it's difficult for me, for many of us, to easily
accept that a sentient being can live only to be what someone else
wants them to be. <br>
KAMALA: But that's what gives a metamorph pleasure. <br>
PICARD: But what about your wishes, your needs? <br>
KAMALA: They are fulfilled by what I give to others. <br>
PICARD: And what about when there are no others, when you are alone? <br>
KAMALA: I'm incomplete. What curious questions, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Under the circumstances, I thought that it would help if I
learned more about you. <br>
KAMALA: But you know me better than you realise. I am independent,
forceful, brilliant, and adventurous. Exactly as you would have me be,
Captain. <br>

comfortable. <br>
LENOR: You deserve to live a life of luxury. <br>
BRIAM: How dare you suggest <br>
(He throws the coins on the floor) <br>
QOL: Our money! What? You drive a hard bargain. <br>
LENOR: Twenty thousand, but not an ingot more. <br>
QOL: We must have the metamorph. <br>
LENOR: She is the answer to a Ferengi prayer. <br>
QOL: We have a ship waiting to rendezvous with us in three hours. We
can all transport off together. <br>
BRIAM: Thank you for sharing that information. I shall pass on along to
Captain Picard. <br>
LENOR: You can't do that. <br>
BRIAM: Let go of me. <br>
(The pair haul Briam away from the door and he is thrown into a glass
table, which of course shatters)

condition. If we're lucky he'll regain consciousness in a few days. Set
up level one cranio-sacral display. <br>
MEDIC [OC]: Yes, Doctor. <br>
PICARD: I'll advise the Valtese delegation that the conference will
have to be postponed. <br>
KAMALA: That won't be possible. My ability to imprint on a mate will
only last a matter of hours after the completion of the Finiis'ral. If
I hadn't been removed from stasis prematurely, a delay might have
been possible. But now, I will have to bond with Alrik within two days.
<br>
PICARD: But there are points in the negotiations that Briam still has
to address. <br>
KAMALA: You are familiar with the issues. <br>
PICARD: Familiar, yes, but I can't represent your peoples' interests. <br>
KAMALA: You can represent the interests of peace. My people will agree,
I'm certain of it. <br>
PICARD: But there are customs and rituals of which I have no experience
at all. <br>
KAMALA: I told you, I'm extremely knowledgeable about Valt. I will help
you prepare.

xylophone)&nbsp;<br>
KAMALA: Torze qua. <br>
(he plays the chords and notes) <br>
KAMALA: That's right. <br>
PICARD: I'm reminded of piano lessons when I was a child. Preparing for
some dreaded recital. <br>
KAMALA: You still play? <br>
PICARD: No. I regret that I gave it up. It used to please my mother.
But I didn't like performing in front of an audience. <br>
KAMALA: Shy? <br>
PICARD: No. Just not very good. <br>
KAMALA: Thank you. For letting down your guard, if only for a moment. <br>
PICARD: You will have to help me in the pronunciation of this scroll. <br>
KAMALA: What is it about me you fear? <br>
PICARD: Kamala. <br>
KAMALA: Do you find me unattractive? <br>
PICARD: I find you unavailable. <br>
KAMALA: I'm being terribly selfish. I apologise. We have something in
common, Captain. When I was a child, I took music lessons, too. <br>
PICARD: Really? What instrument? <br>
KAMALA: All of them. <br>
PICARD: The entire orchestra? <br>
KAMALA: Plus a few Valtese horns that sound like braying Targhee
Moonbeasts. They are said to soothe the nerves of Valtese men. My
mother never even heard me play. I was taken from her when I was four
and sequestered in a royal village where I was prepared to fulfill my
destiny. <br>
PICARD: It sounds as if it were a very lonely time for you. <br>
KAMALA: On the contrary, I had servants and tutors at my side
constantly. You once asked me what I'm like when I'm alone. I've never
been. There was always somebody there to educate me in literature,
history, art, sex. But I have been alone on this journey, and I've
found myself thinking about all the curious questions you asked. You
wanted to know who I am. And as I continue to ask myself, the only
answer that comes to me is, I am for you, Alrik of Valt. Because that's
the truth. In a day, I will bond with a man I've never met. and I will
turn myself into what he wants me to be, for the rest of my life. <br>
PICARD: I also once asked you if you were doing this of your own
accord. <br>
KAMALA: I'm honoured to be chosen to serve my people as an emissary of
peace. But I find it ironic on the eve of this ceremony, which I have
spent my entire life preparing for, that I should meet a man like you. <br>

ALRIK: Captain Picard. <br>
PICARD: Chancellor Alrik. Welcome aboard the Enterprise. <br>
ALRIK: Your First Officer has described the details of the incident
with the Ferengis. How is the Ambassador? <br>
PICARD: He has not regained consciousness. <br>
ALRIK: A tragedy. Your willingness to assist is appreciated by both our
peoples. <br>
PICARD: I', doing my best, although I'm finding some of the rituals
quite demanding. <br>
ALRIK: Rituals. I am more concerned about the remaining provisions of
the treaty. The proposed trade agreements are not
acceptable. We still must review the uncommitted territories as well as
discuss the schedule for exchange of technology. <br>
PICARD: The Kriosians have authorised me to make several compromises
favourable to your position. <br>
ALRIK: Good. Tomorrow, then. <br>
PICARD: Briam has supervised a reproduction of the ancient Temple of
Akadar on our holodeck. <br>
ALRIK: Such a sentimental people, these Kriosians. It's hard to believe
we have a common ancestry. <br>
PICARD: Please. <br>
ALRIK: I suppose they've sent the metamorph. <br>
PICARD: Kamala? Yes. She's looking forward to meeting you. <br>
ALRIK: I'm sure she'll be satisfactory. Between you and me, Captain, I
am far more interested in the trade agreements.

KAMALA: When am I to be presented? <br>

KAMALA: Would you like some tea? <br>
PICARD: Thank you, but I should prepare for the ceremony. <br>
KAMALA: Let me help you with pronunciations. <br>
PICARD: I think I can muddle my way through. <br>
KAMALA: Please don't leave. Talk to me. I love the sound of your voice.
I'll turn out the lights and just listen. I don't want to be alone. <br>
PICARD: The lights stay on. <br>
KAMALA: Earl Grey Tea. Hot. <br>
PICARD: Did you learn that from Commander Data as well? I shall have to
have a talk with him. <br>
(they sit) <br>
PICARD: Now that I know that you're listening to my voice, I find that
I can't think of anything to say. <br>
KAMALA: A starship captain must encounter all sorts of lifeforms. Am I
one of the most unique you've ever met? Please say yes. <br>
PICARD: Yes. <br>
KAMALA: What a nice thing to say. <br>

PICARD: Kamala, have I not done everything possible to discourage this?
<br>
KAMALA: Maybe that's the perfect way to attract a metamorph. <br>
PICARD: I don't want to use you as other men do. <br>
KAMALA: But you're not other men. You could never use me. That's the
very reason why I'm with you tonight. <br>

early. <br>
KAMALA: Light years away.

CRUSHER: The metamorph? <br>
PICARD: The metamorph. Kamala. I've spent quite a lot of time with her
the past few days, and you're right about several things, but, Beverly,
her entire existence has been orchestrated for this moment and she
intends to go through with it to help her people end the war. <br>
CRUSHER: And you're saying there's nothing you can do about it? <br>
PICARD: It isn't that simple. I barely know who she is, and who she is
changes the moment the next man
comes into the room.&nbsp; And I find myself hoping that the next
man won't come in. But, of
course, he does, and in a few hours, the ceremony will begin and she
will mate with a man who cares more about trade agreements than he
cares about her. And I can't help thinking how she will be with him.
How she will change to accommodate him. <br>
CRUSHER: I wish I knew how I could help. <br>

realise that being with him is opening your mind and heart to endless
new possibilities. To hear yourself say, I like myself when I'm with
him. <br>

KAMALA: For a metamorph there's no greater pleasure and no greater wish
than to bond with that kind of mate at the end of the Finiis'ral, as

know. I'm still empathic. I will be able to please him. I only hope he
likes Shakespeare.

easily reach me. And yet I would be lying if I were to claim, that even
at my age, they do not reach me at all. But you, you worked with her,
side by side for days. How could you resist her? <br>
