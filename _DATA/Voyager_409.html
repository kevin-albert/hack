<font face="Arial" size="2">(Leonardo da Vinci storms in, drenched, and
throws down a piece of his flying machine. A crowd is jeering outside.
A dripping Janeway follows him.)<br>DA VINCI: Animali! Brutti animali. Animali!  <br>
		WOMAN [OC]: No, Leonardo, you are the animali. <br>
		MAN [OC]: A bird who cannot fly.<br>
		DA VINCI: Better than a man who cannot think!<br>
		CHILDREN [OC]: The pidgeon speaks. Cuckoo, cuckooo! <br>(da Vinci picks up a large vase to throw at the crowd. Janeway stops him.)<br>
		JANEWAY: Maestro! <br>
		DA VINCI: Stupido! Foolish Florentines! A bird is a mechanical instrument that 
		works according to mathematical laws. An instrument that surely I can recreate. 
		How did it fail? <br>
		JANEWAY: Maybe you underestimated the wingspan? <br>
		DA VINCI: Had not the river Arno taken us to its arms we would both have died. <br>
		JANEWAY: Jumping off the bridge was a wise precaution. <br>
		DA VINCI: Against death, yes. Against humiliation, no. The great bird will take 
		flight and bring glory to its nest. So I have bragged for months. 
		Instead, we almost drown with half of Florence watching. Bah! Finito! No more. 
		Catarina, have you been to France? <br> 
		JANEWAY: Not recently. <br>
		DA VINCI: The King of France is a great admirer of mine. The Divine Leonardo 
		is all I hear when I walk through his streets. And what music do I find in the 
		streets of Florence, eh? The cooing of pigeons and the babbling of fools. 
		Catarina, we are leaving! <br>
		JANEWAY: You're giving up. Again. Your beautiful painting of the Adoration, 
		the great bronze horse in Milan, the Battle of Anghiari. Unfinished, 
		all of them. You were going to publish your notebooks. You never did. 
		You have given up, abandoned your most important works. Why? <br>
		DA VINCI: There is a tavern just outside Paris, Catarina. A charming bistro 
		where the wine is <br>(Rumble!)<br>DA VINCI: Terremoto! <br>

		SEVEN: And now you believe the sensors can be extended by using

		SEVEN: An algorithmic feedback is interfering with the resolution. Decompile data banks 
		fifty nine through seventeen and attempt to isolate it. Now. Or you should leave. <br>
KIM: Okay. I'm a pretty easy-going person. I mean, it takes a lot to
ruffle my feathers. But that's not true of everybody. You've got to

		CHAKOTAY: Can you find the main computer processor?  <br>
		KIM: It's on the northern continent, in what looks like a city, but there's a 
		lot of signal interference. I'll never be able to localise it from here. <br>
		TUVOK: Captain, I have identified nearly twenty seven kinds of alien ships in orbit of this planet. 
		It appears to be an active centre of commerce.  We should be able to place an undercover 
		away team on either continent without attracting attention. <br>
		JANEWAY: That's good enough for now. Tuvok, you and I are going after the processor. Tom, Neelix, 
		I want you on the other continent. Find out what you can. At the very least,

<font face="Arial" size="2">		<b>[Market place]</b>
		</font></p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">(Janeway and Tuvok are in casual clothes.)<br>JANEWAY: It never fails to impress me. No matter how vast the differences may be between cultures, 
		people always have something that somebody else wants, and trade is born. <br>
		TUVOK: Or more to the point, theft. <br>
		JANEWAY:  What have you got? <br>
		TUVOK: The materials in the construction of this city, and the technology 
		in use appear to have originated from numerous sources.   <br>
		JANEWAY: No doubt stolen. <br>
		TUVOK: The myriad signatures have resulted in high interference levels. I am unable to. 
		A moment. I am picking up a Starfleet signature. <br>
		JANEWAY: The computer processor?  <br>
		TUVOK: I don't believe so. The signal magnitude is too low. The signature is 
		approaching. <br>
		DA VINCI: Catarina! Che meraviglia! Out of my way, out of my way! Scusi, scusi. Catarina. 
		Catarina. Welcome. Welcome to America. <br>(da Vinci is wearing the mobile emitter.)<br>DA VINCI: Tell me, Catarina, what do you think of the New World?<br>
		JANEWAY: How did you get here?  <br>
		DA VINCI: A question I have asked myself many times. One moment I was packing for my journey to France, the next I was 
		in this land of marvels. Possibly, upon leaving my workshop I was accosted by 
		Spanish sailors, rendered unconscious, delivered to a galleon in the port of 
		Genoa, and carried like a sack of grain across the vast Atlantic. Curious ears. <br>
		JANEWAY: My travelling companion, Tuvok. <br>
		DA VINCI: Ah, what the old philosophers say is true. 
		Monstrous and wonderful are the peoples of undiscovered lands. 
		But tell me, Catarina, how did you come to the Americas? <br>
		JANEWAY: Oh, it's a long story. A Portuguese ship, some Turkish pirates, 
		a couple of hurricanes. I'll tell you about it some other time. <br>
		DA VINCI: Excuse me. There is the man I have been looking for. He has an apparatus 
		that I need for my next invention. My patron is a demanding taskmaster. <br>
		JANEWAY: Your patron? <br>
		DA VINCI: The prince of this city. Buon giorno, signore. <br>
		TUVOK: The Da Vinci character is interpreting this world through the 
		limited capacity of his holodeck programme. <br>
		JANEWAY: He sees everything in sixteenth century terms. <br>
		TUVOK: But what is he doing here? <br>
		JANEWAY: I was running the Da Vinci simulation when we were attacked. His
        programme must have been active in the computer's memory when the processor was beamed off the ship. <br>
		TUVOK: And then downloaded into the Doctor's mobile emitter. But by whom? <br>
		JANEWAY: His patron, the Prince?<br>(da Vinci returns with the item.) <br>
		DA VINCI: Marvellous, no? <br>
		TUVOK: A plasma injector conduit, Starfleet issue. <br>
		DA VINCI: Call it what you will. With this machine I can make mercury flow in three directions at once. 
		You must see my new workshop. The Prince has been very supportive. Andiamo! <br>

<font face="Arial" size="2">		DA VINCI: So, Catarina, what do you think of this place? My workshop 
		in Florence was but a cave of ignorance in comparison. <br>
		JANEWAY: Your new patron gave you all this? <br>
		DA VINCI: He is the perfect prince. Intelligent, but not overly so. 
		In awe of my talent, but not threatened by it. And above all, and 
		most importantly, his purse is inexhaustible. <br>
		JANEWAY: And in return for all this support? <br>
		DA VINCI: I give him my ideas. I have even resurrected my Great Bird, like the 
		Phoenix of legend. They have materials here, Catarina, that are so strong and 
		so light that surely my prototype will ascend to the heavens. <br>(Janeway spots a phaser and picks it up. da Vinci snatches it from her.)<br>DA VINCI: Be careful! 
		They have found a way to harness the energy of a 
		thunderstorm and to expel it with great force. A pistole that shoots 
		not a lead ball but a bolt of lightning. <br>(da Vinci demonstrates by atomising an ornament in an alcove.)<br>
		JANEWAY: I'd like to meet this patron you yours. <br>

		then it is a cage of gold, of marvels, of opportunities. If this Prince is violent, violence can be tempered. <br>
		JANEWAY: You can't stay here forever, Leonardo. Europe is your home. <br>
		DA VINCI: Europe is despicable! Here I am free to do what I wish. Free from judgment, 
		free to fail, but without a sense of shame, without, without the taunts of the ignorant. <br>
		JANEWAY: Leonardo, whether you want to admit it or not they do need you back home. 
		In Florence, Milan, Avignon, they need your genius, they need your heart. And 
		right now I need you, too. So come on. <br>
