50614.2. Ensign Kaplan and I are returning to Voyager after completing
a scouting mission in the Nekrit Expanse. </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Shuttlecraft]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Kaplan
is a female officer.) <br>
KAPLAN: The nebula's completely scrambling our navigational readings. I
still can't get a fix on our position. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Are you saying we're lost, Ensign? <br>
KAPLAN: That depends what you mean by lost, sir. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Lost as in you can't get a fix on our position. <br>
KAPLAN: I'm sorry, sir. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Try hailing Voyager again. <br>
KAPLAN: No response. We must still be out of comm. range. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Then we'll just have to navigate the old-fashioned way.
Engage optical scanners. <br>
KAPLAN: Aye, sir. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm picking up an asteroid field at coordinates one one three
mark seven. Record it. <br>
KAPLAN: Er, sir. That asteroid field? It's the same one we passed two
hours ago. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Great. We're not only lost, we're flying in circles. <br>
(Beeping.) <br>
KAPLAN: It's a Federation hailing beacon, originating bearing three oh
nine mark four. It's Voyager. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Well, at least someone knows where we are. <br>
KAPLAN: Setting a course. <br>
(They arrive in orbit of a planet.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: The signal's coming from the planet surface. <br>
KAPLAN: Is it possible Voyager's landed? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Sensor readings are sketchy. I'm detecting about eighty
thousand humanoid life forms on the western continent, some rudimentary
structures and technology, but no energy signature big enough to be a
starship. <br>
KAPLAN: I'm getting another hail. The signal's very weak, and it's
definitely not being sent by Voyager. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Try adjusting the bandwidth. <br>
RILEY [OC]: Calling approaching Federation vessel. We need your help
urgently. <br>
CHAKOTAY: This is Commander Chakotay of the Starship Voyager. Please
identify yourself. <br>
RILEY [OC]: I'm not reading you. Federation vessel, please respond. <br>
KAPLAN: We lost them, sir. <br>
CHAKOTAY: They've identified us as a Federation ship. <br>
KAPLAN: Who would know that? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Whoever they are, they're asking for our help. Launch a
message buoy letting Voyager know we've landed in response to a
distress call. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Night.
Fires burn in makeshift braziers.) <br>
KAPLAN: This place looks like a war zone. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I can't pinpoint the source of the transmission. <br>
(Four armed figures step out from the metal structures.) <br>
KAPLAN: Commander. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm Commander Chakotay of the Starship Voyager. We're
responding to a distress call. We're looking for whoever it was who
asked for our help. <br>
KAPLAN: Commander! <br>
(One figure raises his weapon, and Kaplan pushes Chakotay aside.
Everyone takes cover and starts shooting. Kaplan gets hit, then
Chakotay is jumped from behind. They struggle, and Chakotay knocks out
his attacker. One person carefully aims his weapon and stuns Chakotay,
but is then driven off by a new group arriving.) <br>
ATTACKER: Come on. <br>
ORUM: Take him inside. <br>
(Chakotay is dragged away, and his hand phaser retrieved.) </font></p>

(Chakotay wakes up face down on a bed. He has nasty bruises on the
right side of his forehead. A woman with long blonde hair speaks.) <br>
RILEY: I'd lie still if I were you. You've got a nasty head injury. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You're human. <br>
RILEY: My name's Riley Frazier. What's yours, Commander? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Why did you attack us? <br>
RILEY: Those weren't my people. I'm the one who sent the distress call.
We rescued you. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What did you do with Kaplan? <br>
RILEY: Your Ensign? She didn't make it. I'm sorry. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I've got to get back to my shuttle. <br>
RILEY: Your shuttle isn't there any more. The people who attacked you
have already pulled it apart. Relax, Commander. I'm here to help you. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How did <br>
RILEY: How did I get here? I could ask you the same question. I was
pretty surprised when I picked up a Federation ship out there. Not that
I wasn't happy about it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's a long story. Why don't you go first. <br>
RILEY: Seven or eight years ago, I was working as a science officer on
a vessel in the Bolian Sector. We were attacked without warning by
aliens. They overpowered us in minutes and those of us who survived
were put in some kind of stasis. The next thing we knew, we were here
on this planet. It didn't take too many hours of stargazing to realise
we weren't in the Alpha Quadrant any longer. <br>
CHAKOTAY: There are other humans here? <br>
RILEY: Three that I know of, besides me. What was left of my crew.
Along with some Klingons, Cardassians, Romulans, and dozens of other
species I'd never seen before. <br>
CHAKOTAY: And the ones who put you in stasis? <br>
RILEY: I don't know. They must have had some kind of colony here at
some time because of the ruined buildings and equipment they left
scattered around. We've never seen them again. Everyone here has pretty
much the same story. They were just grabbed from wherever they happened
to be, and dumped. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Why did those people kill Kaplan? We were no threat to them. <br>
RILEY: There are dozens of different races on this planet, all of whom
were brought here against their will. Many of them are suspicious of
other species. It's not exactly a United Federation around here, if you
know what I mean. <br>
CHAKOTAY: So those kind of attacks, they go on all the time? <br>
RILEY: Resources are pretty limited. It didn't take long for the
fighting to start. At first a group of Klingons attacked the
Cardassians, then the Farn raided the Parein. Eventually things just
got out of hand, and now it's anarchy. But some of us, a few hundred or
so, we've tried to make the best of it. We've established a
cooperative, sharing work and whatever provisions we have. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I've got to contact my ship. <br>
RILEY: The raiders destroyed the communications array. It'll take days
to fix it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I can help you. <br>
RILEY: Our medic examined you. You suffered serious neural trauma.
You're staying put. And that's an order, Commander. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
Captain's log, stardate 50622.4. While Commander Chakotay scouts for a
faster route through the Nekrit Expanse, we are continuing our
month-long journey through this sparsely populated region. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PARIS:
You know, they ought to rename this region the Negative Expanse. We
haven't run across anything interesting for days. <br>
JANEWAY: If you're bored, Mister Paris, I'm sure I can find something
else for you to do. The warp plasma filters are due for a thorough
cleaning. <br>
PARIS: Now that you mention it, Captain, I find this region of space a
real navigational challenge. <br>
TUVOK: I believe I may have found something else to pique Mister
Paris's interest, Captain. It's an unidentified ship on long range
sensors. <br>
JANEWAY: What sort of ship? <br>
TUVOK: Sensor readings are very limited, but the vessel appears to be
stopped directly in our current flightpath. <br>
JANEWAY: Harry, send a standard greeting. <br>
KIM: Aye, Captain. They're not responding. <br>
JANEWAY: Try retransmitting the hail on wideband subspace. <br>
KIM: Still no response. <br>
TUVOK: We are entering visual range. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. <br>
(The faint image of a large dark cube can just be made out against the
black of space.) <br>
PARIS: The Borg. <br>
JANEWAY: Red Alert! All stop, shields to maximum, standby all weapons.
Tuvok, are they scanning us? <br>
TUVOK: Curious. None of the Borg systems appears to be operational. <br>
KIM: He's right, they're adrift. <br>
PARIS: Maybe they're trying to lull us into a false sense of security. <br>
TUVOK: That would not be consistent with typical Borg tactics. <br>
JANEWAY: I want to try a multiphasic scan. Tom, stand by to get us out
of here in case they react. <br>
PARIS: Aye, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Proceed, Mister Kim. <br>
KIM: I'm not picking up any active energy signatures. And no life
signs. <br>
PARIS: Well, that's a relief. <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps. However, we should avoid complacency. The Borg are
known to retrieve their damaged technology. It is quite possible we
will encounter additional Borg vessels which are fully manned and
powered. <br>
JANEWAY: That's exactly why we're going to board that ship. <br>
TUVOK: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: This is a rare opportunity to learn as much as we can about
Borg technology. <br>
TORRES: I might be able to get one of their data nodes running and find
out what disabled their ship. <br>
JANEWAY: If we're lucky, we may find a weakness we can use against
them, in case we run into one of their fully manned and powered ships.
Tuvok, assemble an away team. Tom. <br>
PARIS: Yes, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Take us into transporter range. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bunker]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> RILEY:
We grow all our own food in the cooperative garden. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's delicious. <br>
RILEY: Sorry there's no meat. <br>
CHAKOTAY: No problem. I'm a vegetarian. <br>
RILEY: Really? I have reoccurring dreams about my mother's famous Texas
barbeque. So, your journey home. How much longer do you expect it will
take you? <br>
CHAKOTAY: About sixty seven years, provided we don't find a wormhole or
some other faster way of getting back. <br>
RILEY: Haven't you ever thought about finding some nice M-class planet
and putting down roots? <br>
CHAKOTAY: We'd be missing an incredible opportunity to explore unknown
space. Besides, we've made a good life for ourselves on Voyager. I'm
sure Captain Janeway would be amenable to take as many of your people
with us as we can accommodate. <br>
RILEY: Take us with you? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I assumed that's why you sent the distress call. <br>
RILEY: You misunderstood. We want to stay. <br>
CHAKOTAY: But you were brought here against your will. You just said
how dangerous it is. <br>
RILEY: For better or worse, this place has become our home. The people
in the cooperative, they're like my ancestors. Texas homesteaders. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I can understand that, but <br>
RILEY: We have a deep connection to one another that I've never felt
before. Not even with members of my own family. I guess it's because of
what we've all gone through together. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What about those unfriendly neighbours of yours? <br>
RILEY: We're been able to bring a few of them into our group, but
you're right, they're a problem. That's why we want your help. Security
upgrades, medical supplies, maybe some weapons. We're creating a
society here, one that's based on tolerance, shared responsibility and
mutual respect that people like you and I were raised to believe in.
We're not about to give it up because it's difficult. I'd better get
back to work on the communications array. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'll come with you. <br>
RILEY: No. You're still in no shape to fight if we're attacked. I'll be
back to check on you soon. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Borg
Cube]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
It's like a ghost ship. <br>
TUVOK: Allowing yourself to become apprehensive can only be
counterproductive, Lieutenant. <br>
TORRES: I'm not being apprehensive, Tuvok, I'm just nervous as hell.
This is one of the access nodes. If we can get it operational I should
be able to tap into the main data systems. Tuvok, there should be a
compatible micropower conduit somewhere in that module. Connect it to
this generator. <br>
(Tuvok moves some hoses apart and a Borg falls forward.) <br>
TUVOK: Lieutenant. <br>
TORRES: It's dead. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Briefing
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
As far as we can tell, all activity on the Borg ship ceased abruptly
five years ago. <br>
TORRES: Our scans have detected eleven hundred corpses. <br>
TUVOK: We located a breached section of the vessel where the spatial
vacuum preserved several of the bodies perfectly. <br>
TORRES: We brought one aboard. We're hoping that an autopsy might give
us some clue as to what killed them. <br>
JANEWAY: The question is, why have the Borg left one of their ships and
all it's technology adrift in space for anyone to find? <br>
TUVOK: It is possible that the deactivation of the ship and it's
systems severed the link with the rest of the Collective. <br>
KIM: But what caused the shut-down in the first place? <br>
TORRES: It could have been some kind of natural disaster, or <br>
KIM: Or what? <br>
TORRES: Maybe the Borg were defeated by an enemy even more powerful
than they are. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok, continue scanning for any Borg vessels in the vicinity,
as well as any other ships that might be more powerful. B'Elanna, you
and the Doctor get started on that autopsy. In the meantime, I think it
would be a good idea to rendezvous with Commander Chakotay a little
ahead of schedule, and let him know we've run into some old friends. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bunker]</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
(Chakotay tries operating the door controls, then knocks on the door
itself.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Hello? Anybody there? Riley? <br>
(He returns to the controls and finally hits the right ones. Sunlight
streams in.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Settlement]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (There
are people from many races here, all bald, some missing forearms.
Chakotay sees a small group on the far side. One man with a Borg eye
implant and cyborg forearm is working on another person with a metal
plate at the back of their skull. That person turns around.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Riley? What are you? Are you Borg? <br>
RILEY: We were Borg. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You mean you weren't just kidnapped. You were assimilated by
the Collective. <br>
RILEY: At Wolf 359. I was a science officer aboard the Roosevelt. Five
years ago, our ship was damaged by an electrokinetic storm. The next
thing we knew, our link to the Collective was severed. We were free! We
could think for ourselves again, remember our names, where we'd come
from. <br>
ORUM: It was like waking up from a long nightmare. We took what we
thought we could use and transported ourselves here. <br>
RILEY: Everything was new again. The sounds of our own voices,
forgotten memories, the taste of food. <br>
ORUM: Our original skin pigmentation began to come back. Many of us
were able to remove our Borg appendages. <br>
RILEY: I was even lucky enough to get a prosthetic arm Orum created
using Borg replication equipment. In spite of how little we had it was
a joyous, hopeful time.<br>
CHAKOTAY: And then? <br>
RILEY: After the euphoria wore off, people started looking around and
found they were living among other cultures they didn't understand, or
worse, species they'd been taught to hate. They turned against one
another. Things became chaotic. <br>
ORUM: The fighting, the raids. <br>
RILEY: But we're not all like that. Everything I told you about forming
a cooperative, building a new society, I meant it. <br>
ORUM: Riley is telling the truth, Commander Chakotay. Look at me. I was
Romulan. I was taught to hate humans, the Federation. But Riley and I
are friends now. I'm part of the cooperative. <br>
RILEY: Orum's our medic. He's the one who examined you. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Why didn't you tell me all this in the first place? <br>
RILEY: I know how people feel about the Borg, and they're right. We did
terrible things. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You'd been assimilated. You weren't in control of your
actions. <br>
RILEY: Then you'll still help us? <br>
(Chakotay's eyes roll back, and he staggers. Orum catches him.) <br>
ORUM: I think right now it's Commander Chakotay who needs our help. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
Captain's log, supplemental. We've detected a message buoy launched
from Chakotay's shuttle and are heading toward it. The autopsy of the
Borg corpse is underway. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH: I
must say, there's nothing like the vacuum of space for preserving a
handsome corpse. Subject's abdominal organs are unremarkable. Pulmonary
system exhibits evidence of extensive alveolar damage, as well as a
slight swelling consistent with exposure to space. Ah, in addition
there are signs of severe cardiac depolarisation. <br>
KES: Sounds like he was electrocuted. <br>
EMH: Very good, Kes. <br>
TORRES: That would support our theory about what happened aboard their
ship. We think that their main power conduits were overloaded by a
massive electromechanical discharge. <br>
EMH: Hmm. This is intriguing. <br>
TORRES: What do you think that is? <br>
EMH: It may be some kind of axonal amplifier. Kes, hand me a cortical
probe. <br>
(The EMH activates the probe and pokes it into the implant. The Borg
activates and sits up.) <br>
TORRES: Shut it down! <br>
(The EMH uses the probe again.) <br>
TORRES: What the hell happened? <br>
KES: Is it still alive? <br>
EMH: Of course not. Apparently, I inadvertently activated a backup
neuroelectric power cell. The response was purely autonomic. There's no
reason for concern. <br>
TORRES: I wouldn't be so sure about that. <br>
EMH: What do you mean? <br>
TORRES: That autonomic response caused this drone to reset back to it's
original programming. If the rest of those corpses somehow reactivate,
we have a major problem on our hands. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bunker]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> ORUM:
I'm afraid he's getting worse. <br>
RILEY: There must be something we can do for him. <br>
ORUM: You know better than anyone how limited our medical resources
are. As far as I'm concerned, there is only one option. <br>
RILEY: Would it be safe? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Would what be safe? <br>
ORUM: As I'm sure you're aware, the Borg collective consciousness is
extremely powerful. It allowed us to transfer information
instantaneously, to think with one mind. But what you may not be aware
of is the link also has inherent medical applications. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Medical applications? <br>
ORUM: We were connected by a continuous neuroelectrical field that was
capable of regenerating the damaged components of an injured Borg. <br>
RILEY: Think of it as a subspace transfusion, only instead of one
person giving blood there are hundreds, perhaps thousands of donors
simultaneously transmitting neuroelectric energy to whoever needed it. <br>
ORUM: This process was often successful in healing both organic and
inorganic body parts. <br>
CHAKOTAY: This is all very fascinating, but I don't see how it helps
me. <br>
RILEY: We still have Borg neural processors implanted in our nervous
systems. Removing them would have killed us. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I see. <br>
RILEY: Using a portable neural transponder we have the ability to
re-link our brain patterns. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I thought you said the link was severed. <br>
RILEY: It was. <br>
ORUM: But we can reinitiate it among a small group for a short time. We
could generate a neuroelectric field that could heal your injuries. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You want to hook up my mind to some Borg collective! <br>
RILEY: No, that's not it at all. <br>
ORUM: We'd be in complete control. You'd simply be linked for a limited
period of time to Riley, me, and a few of the others in our group
willing to help you. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm not letting anyone implant some neural processor in my
brain. <br>
ORUM: That wouldn't be necessary. I'd simply attach a small neural
transceiver to the base of your skull. We'd initiate the link and your
transceiver could be removed as soon as the procedure was over. I
assure you, other than repairing neural tissue, there would be no
lasting effects. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Thanks, but I don't think so. <br>
RILEY: I can see why you're sceptical. I would be too. Look around you.
Orum and I, all the others, we're individuals. We have distinct
personalities. We're not about to turn you into some kind of automaton.
<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'll take my chances and wait for Voyager. <br>
ORUM: I'm afraid that help may come too late, Commander. If we don't do
something to slow the neural degradation immediately, you will die. <br>
(Later, a small group has gathered at Chakotay's bedside.) <br>
RILEY: Chakotay, you have to make a decision. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Any sign of Voyager? <br>
RILEY: No. I can't change who we are. I wasn't truthful with you before
and I'm sorry. But please, believe me when I tell you we only want to
help you. Orum will take every precaution. Please, at least let us try
and save you. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's either that or the Happy Hunting Grounds, huh? <br>
RILEY: Okay, then? <br>
ORUM: This is the neurotransceiver. <br>
(He places the small device at the back of Chakotay's head.) <br>
RILEY: Don't be afraid, Chakotay. We're here to help you. <br>
COOPERATIVE [OC]: Open your mind to our thoughts and concentrate on
getting well. Hear our voices, open your mind to our thoughts. Our
collective strength can heal you. You're safe with us. Feel the
connection. We're with you. See who we are. Know us. You are not alone.
Our strength is your strength. We can overcome your pain. We welcome
you into our thoughts. There's nothing to fear, we won't let you die.
We're all one circle, no beginning, no end. <br>
(Chakotay sees some of Riley's memories. An attacking Cube, horses
running free on a ranch, bluebonnets, her grandfather, the battle of
Wolf 359, the Klingon homeworld. Much later -) <br>
RILEY: How do you feel? Don't worry, it's gone. It looks like the
treatment worked. Orum says the degraded tissue has shown marked
improvement. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It was incredible. <br>
RILEY: I know. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I heard all of you, your thoughts inside my head, as if they
were my thoughts. And I could see myself through your eyes. <br>
RILEY: Then you must have caught me staring. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I saw faces, planets. What were they? <br>
RILEY: Images from the minds of the people who linked with you.
Memories of their families, their homes. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I know things about all of them, about you. You like
bluebonnets. <br>
RILEY: My favourite flower. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You used to pick them back home in Texas with a man who
carried a walking stick. <br>
RILEY: My grandfather. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I know so much about you. <br>
RILEY: We shared a very rare experience. <br>
(Riley strokes her own cheek.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: I felt that. <br>
RILEY: What about this? <br>
(She strokes her inner arm.) <br>
RILEY: It's a residual effect from the link. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How long will it last? <br>
RILEY: An hour, maybe two. Long enough. [OC] Can you still here what
I'm thinking? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes. <br>
RILEY [OC]: Then you know I want to be closer to you. I want us to know
everything about each other. I want you to feel everything I feel. </font></p>

CHAKOTAY: You're the ones who saved my life. <br>
ORUM: But you've added so much to the cooperative. A renewed sense of
hope, an infusion of energy. You have no idea how invigorating it was
to have a new mind in the link, even if it was only for a short time.
There have been so few of us for so long, I. Well, I'll let you two get
back to work. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I was so resistant to being linked. Now I'm almost sorry it's
over. <br>
RILEY: I know. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Last night when we were still connected, I realised what it
is you really want from us. It's more than just supplies and security
upgrades. <br>
RILEY: That's right. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's a pretty radical concept. <br>
RILEY: Sometimes radical problems require radical solutions. <br>
ORUM: Riley! Commander Chakotay! We've detected a ship in orbit. It
must be Voyager. <br>
RILEY: I hope you'll at least discuss our idea with your Captain. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Why don't you tell her about it yourself? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Briefing
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> RILEY:
We've given it a great deal of thought, and we believe the solution to
our problem is to re-establish the neural link among all the former
Borg living on the planet. <br>
JANEWAY: You can't be serious. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I know it sounds extreme, Captain, but I think you should
hear her out. <br>
JANEWAY: All right. <br>
RILEY: If you think about it, Captain, when we were linked we had no
ethnic conflict. There was no crime, no hunger, no health problems. We
lived as one harmonious family. <br>
JANEWAY: With all due respect, Doctor Frazier, you were one harmonious
family bent on the violent assimilation of innocent cultures. <br>
RILEY: But we're not Borg anymore, and we've learnt from our past. All
we want to do is take the one good thing that existed in the midst of
all that horror, our unique ability to cooperate and problem solve, and
use it to create a safe and productive community. <br>
JANEWAY: Tell me how, exactly. <br>
RILEY: The neurotransponder we've built is only powerful enough to link
a small group of people, like the one that healed Chakotay's wounds. In
any case, the effect is only temporary. In order to re-connect the
entire population permanently we'd need a much bigger neuroelectric
field generator. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm afraid we don't have anything like that. <br>
RILEY: But the Borg Cube does. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What they're asking us to do is reactivate that ship's
neuroelectric generator and redirect it toward the planet. <br>
JANEWAY: They want us to reactivate a Borg ship? <br>
RILEY: Not the whole ship, just the generator. And it only needs to be
operational for a few minutes in order to reactivate the link. <br>
JANEWAY: There's no telling what would happen if we turned on one of
those generators, even for an instant. For all we know it would attract
other Borg vessels. <br>
RILEY: Captain, I can assure you we'd take every precaution. <br>
JANEWAY: Doctor Frazier, I admire your tenacity, I respect your
courage. I'll give you medical supplies, I'll assist you with upgrading
your security, I'll even take some of you with us if you want to come,
but, as to what you're proposing, I have to tell you I'm extremely
sceptical. In fairness however, I will give it some further thought. <br>
RILEY: Thank you. <br>
(Riley leaves with a security guard.) <br>
JANEWAY: What do you think? <br>
CHAKOTAY: If you're asking me whether or not she's sincere, I have to
say yes. <br>
JANEWAY: You got to know them very well. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's an understatement. I heard their thoughts, felt their
feelings, saw through their eyes. <br>
JANEWAY: And in all the time you were linked you never sensed anything
negative? No hidden agenda, no destructive intent? <br>
CHAKOTAY: No. <br>
JANEWAY: Bottom line. Do you think we should do what they're asking? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I really care about what happens to these people, so in my
heart I'd like to do everything we can to help them. But if I were
sitting in your chair, I'd have to take other considerations into
account. <br>
JANEWAY: Not only would it mean imposing a choice on thousands of
people who had no voice in the decision, but it would also be taking a
terrible risk. Helping to create a new collective. Who knows what the
repercussions might be? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'll let Riley know. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Settlement]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Other
crew are also on the planet.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm afraid her decision was final. <br>
RILEY: I wish it weren't, but I expected as much. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What about the raiders? How long do you think you can hold
out against them? <br>
RILEY: Well, we'll just have to do the best we can. Who knows. Maybe
we'll find some other way to get to the cube and reinitiate the link. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Come with us. <br>
RILEY: Chakotay. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We could replicate some Texas Barbeque. I'm sure it won't
compare to your mothers, but I think <br>
RILEY: Don't think it's not tempting, but my place is here. I know you
understand. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I've never understood anyone better in my life. <br>
NEELIX: Well, we're finished laying in the supplies. <br>
RILEY: Thank you, Neelix. <br>
TORRES: We'd better get going. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
Are you okay? What you need is a good thrashing on the hoverball court
to take your mind off things. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You're on. <br>
TORRES: Good. I'll reserve some holodeck time as soon as we're back. <br>
COOPERATIVE [OC]: Chakotay, can you hear us? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Did you say something? <br>
TORRES: No. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Are you getting a comm. transmission? <br>

CHAKOTAY: It must have been my imagination. <br>
TORRES: You're sure you're okay? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm fine. <br>
COOPERATIVE [OC]: Chakotay, we need your help. <br>
TORRES: Chakotay? <br>
COOPERATIVE [OC]: We need your help. <br>
TORRES: I'm going to tell the Doctor he needs to take a look at you as
soon as we're back. Torres to Sickbay. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Don't do that. <br>
(Chakotay points a phaser at Torres.) <br>
TORRES: Chakotay, give me the phaser. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
His neuropeptide levels have returned to normal. <br>
JANEWAY: And there are no residual traces of the link? <br>
EMH: None. <br>
JANEWAY: How were they able to re-establish a connection? <br>
EMH: My best guess is that the residual neuropeptides heightened his
telepathic receptivity. <br>
JANEWAY: I thought their limited equipment made it impossible to form
the link over great distances? <br>
TUVOK: Apparently, once they repaired the communications array, they
were able to magnify the signal from their neurotransponder. <br>
JANEWAY: Would you two please excuse us? <br>
(The EMH and Tuvok leave.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't know what to say except I'm sorry. <br>
JANEWAY: Based on what the Doctor's told us it's clear you were acting
against your will. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe so. But somehow that doesn't make me feel any better. I
helped them repair the communications array, and I told you they were
sincere. <br>
JANEWAY: You know, Chakotay, that's a part of who you are. Given
everything you believe in, I don't see how you could have behaved
differently. <br>
CHAKOTAY: But I couldn't have been more wrong about them, could I? <br>
JANEWAY: I don't know. I'm not saying I'm happy about what happened,
but so far they haven't acted like typical Borg. They saved us from
that Cube, and they let you go. <br>
CHAKOTAY: But they didn't hesitate to impose their collective will on
me when it served their interests, did they? <br>
JANEWAY: No, they didn't. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I wonder how long their ideals will last in the face of that
kind of power. </font> </p>
