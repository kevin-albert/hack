Captain's log, stardate 4307.1. Approaching Starbase Six for a much
needed period of rest and recreation. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: The crew has performed excellently, but is
exhausted. And I, too, am looking forward to a nice period of rest on
some lovely planet. <br>
UHURA: Captain. There was a message from Starbase Six. Heavy
interference. All I get is Intrepid and what sounded like a sector
co-ordinate. <br>
SPOCK: Interesting. No indications of magnetic storms in this sector. <br>
KIRK: Try another channel, Lieutenant. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. <br>
MCCOY: The Intrepid is manned by Vulcans, isn't it? <br>
KIRK: Yes, that's right, Bones. <br>
UHURA: Enterprise calling Starbase Six. Enterprise calling Starbase
Six. Come in. Come in. <br>
(Spock suddenly jerks upright, his face a picture of horror.) <br>
KIRK: Spock? <br>
MCCOY: What is it, Spock? Are you in pain? <br>
SPOCK: Captain, the Intrepid. It just died. And the four hundred
Vulcans aboard, all dead. <br>
MCCOY: Come on, Spock, let's go down to Sickbay. <br>
SPOCK: Doctor, I know what I know. <br>
KIRK: Get to the Sickbay. <br>
SPOCK: Captain. <br>
KIRK: No, no, no. That's an order. <br>
SPOCK: Yes, sir. <br>
(McCoy leads him away.) <br>
UHURA: Captain, I have Starbase Six readable now. Switching to audio,
sir. <br>
KIRK: Kirk here. Go ahead. <br>
STARBASE [OC]: You will divert immediately to sector three nine J. <br>
KIRK: Sir, the Enterprise just completed an exhausting mission. We're
on our way in for R and R. There must be another starship in that
sector. <br>
STARBASE [OC]: Negative. This is a rescue priority. We've lost all
contact with solar system Gamma Seven-A, which the Intrepid was
investigating. And we've just lost contact with the Intrepid. Report
progress. <br>
KIRK: Order acknowledged. Kirk out. Mister Kyle, you heard the order.
Set course for Gamma Seven-A, warp five. <br>
KYLE: Aye, sir. <br>
CHEKOV: Captain I have just completed a full long-range scan of Gamma
Seven-A system. It is dead. <br>
KIRK: Dead? It's a fourth magnitude sun. There are billions of
inhabitants there. <br>
CHEKOV: It is dead.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Spock is on a biobed, being scanned.) <br>
SPOCK: I assure you, Doctor, I am quite all right. The pain was
momentary. It passed quickly. <br>
MCCOY: All of my instruments seem to agree with you if I can trust
these crazy Vulcan readings. Spock, how can you be so sure the lntrepid
was destroyed? <br>
(Spock gets off the bed.) <br>
SPOCK: I sensed it die. <br>
MCCOY: But I thought you had to be in physical contact with a subject
before <br>
SPOCK: Doctor, even I, a half-Vulcan, could hear the death scream of
four hundred Vulcan minds crying out over the distance between us. <br>
MCCOY: Not even a Vulcan could feel a starship die. <br>
SPOCK: Call it a deep understanding of the way things happen to
Vulcans, but I know not a person, not even the computers on board the
Intrepid, knew what was killing them or would have understood it had
they known. <br>
MCCOY: But four hundred Vulcans? <br>
SPOCK: I've noticed that about your people, Doctor. You find it easier
to understand the death of one than the death of a million. You speak
about the objective hardness of the Vulcan heart, yet how little room
there seems to be in yours. <br>
MCCOY: Suffer the death of thy neighbour, eh, Spock? You wouldn't wish
that on us, would you? <br>
SPOCK: It might have rendered your history a bit less bloody. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Spock, you may have been right. We've lost
contact with the Intrepid and we're out of communication with an entire
solar system. Any update from Starfleet? <br>
UHURA: I cannot filter out the distortion, sir. It's getting worse. <br>
KYLE: Captain, deflector shields just snapped on. <br>
KIRK: Slow to warp three. <br>
KYLE: Warp three, sir. <br>
SPOCK: Indications of energy turbulence ahead. Unable to analyse. I've
never encountered readings like this before. <br>
KIRK: Scanners on. Magnification three on the screen. <br>
KYLE: Magnification factor three, sir. <br>
UHURA: Exactly what are we looking for, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: I would assume that. <br>
(In the middle of the viewscreen is a black blob.) <br>
KIRK: What is that? <br>
CHEKOV: Perhaps an interstellar dust cloud. <br>
SPOCK: Not very likely, Ensign. <br>
KIRK: No. You'd be able to see stars through a dust cloud. Looks like a
hole in space. Readings, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Still not able to analyse, Captain. Sensors are feeding data to
the computers now. Whatever this dark zone is, it lies directly in line
with the course I calculate for the Intrepid and the Gamma Seven-A
system. <br>
KIRK: Hold present course. Slow to warp one. <br>
KYLE: Warp factor one, sir. <br>
KIRK: Mister Chekov, prepare to launch a telemetry probe into that
zone. Direct computer feed to Mister Spock. <br>
CHEKOV: Aye, sir. Probe ready. Switching data feed to library computer.
<br>
KIRK: Launch probe. <br>
CHEKOV: Probe launched, sir. <br>
(A high pitched sound comes over the speakers.) <br>
KIRK: What was that? <br>
UHURA: The telemetry probe, sir. There's no signal from it. <br>
KIRK: Speculation, Spock. <br>
SPOCK: I have none, Captain. Insufficient data. <br>
(Chekov is still groaning and Uhura looses her balance.) <br>
SPOCK: Lieutenant. <br>
UHURA: I'm just dizzy. I'll be all right. I'm fine, sir. <br>
MCCOY [OC]: Sickbay to Captain Kirk. McCoy here. <br>
KIRK: Kirk here. What is it? <br>
MCCOY [OC]: I'm getting reports from every deck. Half the people on
this ship just fainted. <br>
KIRK: Uhura almost did. She says she's all right. Do you want to see
her? <br>
MCCOY: Not unless she's feeling ill. I've got an emergency here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK [OC]: What's wrong? <br>
(Crew are queued out of the door, getting shots from Chapel.) <br>
MCCOY: There's nothing organic. They all seem to be nervous, weak, and
irritable. They say it happened suddenly, like a balloon popping. <br>
KIRK [OC]: Can you handle it, Bones? <br>
MCCOY: I'm giving them stimulants to keep them on their feet. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY [OC]: Yeah, we can handle it, Jim. <br>
KIRK: Good. Kirk out. Hold our position, Mister Kyle. <br>
KYLE: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Spock, give me an update on the dark area ahead. <br>
SPOCK: No analysis due to insufficient information. <br>
KIRK: No speculation, no information, nothing. I've asked you three
times for information on that, and you've been unable to supply it.
Insufficient data is not sufficient, Mister Spock. You're the science
officer. You're supposed to have sufficient data all the time. <br>
SPOCK: I am well aware of that, Captain, but the computers contain
nothing on this phenomenon. It is beyond our experience, and the new
information is not yet significant. <br>
KIRK: I don't know about you but I'm tired. If you can't tell me what
it is, let's use reverse logic. Perhaps it'll help if you tell me what
it isn't. <br>
SPOCK: It is not liquid, gaseous, or solid, despite the fact we cannot
see through it. <br>
KIRK: So far that's not much help. <br>
SPOCK: It is not a galactic nebula such as the Coal Sack, and since our
deflectors were activated by it, it would seem to be some form of
energy, but nothing our sensors can identify. <br>
KIRK: Is it possible that this is what killed that solar system and the
Intrepid? <br>
SPOCK: Very possible. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant. <br>
UHURA: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: Notify the Starfleet that we're going to attempt to probe the
area of darkness to gain further information. <br>
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
(Kirk pauses, exhausted on his way back to his chair.) <br>
SPOCK: Captain? <br>
KIRK: I'm all right. Distance from zone of darkness, Mister Kyle? <br>
KYLE: One hundred thousand kilometres, sir. <br>
KIRK: Ahead slow. Impulse power only. <br>
KYLE: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
UHURA: Transmission to Starfleet complete, sir. <br>
KIRK: Very good. Time, Mister Chekov? <br>
CHEKOV: Penetration of the zone in one minute, seven seconds, sir. <br>
KIRK: Red Alert. Deflectors full power. Phaser banks ready. <br>
CHEKOV: Phasers standing by. Deflectors at full power, sir. <br>
(That eardrum splitting sound comes again.) <br>
UHURA: It's not coming from communications, sir. <br>
KIRK: Spock! <br>
SPOCK: Analysing now, Captain. <br>
(The sound goes.) <br>
CHEKOV: Captain, the stars are gone! <br>
(The viewscreen is completely blank.) <br>
KIRK: Malfunction, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. All systems functioning properly. <br>
KIRK: Then kindly tell me what happened to the stars. <br>
SPOCK: Unknown, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Kirk to McCoy. <br>
MCCOY [OC]: McCoy here. <br>
KIRK: Things any better down there? <br>
MCCOY [OC]: Worse. They're backed up into the corridor. <br>
KIRK: Have you got anything that will help up here? I don't want
anybody folding on the bridge at a critical moment. <br>
MCCOY [OC]: On my way. McCoy out. <br>
KIRK: Kirk to Engineering. Scotty, there was a power loss. How come? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SCOTT: We lost five percent of our energy reserve,
sir. Our deflector shields are weakened. <br>
KIRK [OC]: Can you compensate for the loss? <br>
SCOTT: Aye, if we don't lose any more. Don't ask me how it happened. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: I am asking how, mister. I want answers. Kirk
out. <br>
(McCoy enters with a nurse, and starts injecting the crew.) <br>
KIRK: What's that? <br>
MCCOY: A stimulant. <br>
KIRK: Bones, how bad is it? <br>
MCCOY: Two thirds of the personnel are affected. <br>
KIRK: Why? How? Do you have any answers? <br>
MCCOY: No. You know you'll get everything I can tell you. But when
there is nothing, what should I say? <br>
(The man at the engineering station collapses.) <br>
MCCOY: Nurse. <br>
KIRK: This ship is in trouble. We'd better start solving problems
faster than we pick up new ones. We seem to be in the middle of a
creeping paralysis. Mister Spock, analysis of that last burst of noise
before we started losing power. <br>
SPOCK: That sound was turbulence caused by the penetration of a
boundary layer, Captain. <br>
KIRK: What boundary layer? <br>
SPOCK: Unknown. <br>
KIRK: Boundary layer between what and what? <br>
SPOCK: Between where we were and where we are. <br>
KIRK: Are you trying to be funny, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: It would never occur to me, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Do you have any ideas, Spock? <br>
SPOCK: We still have no specifics, but we seem to have entered a zone
of energy which is incompatible with our living and mechanical
processes. As we draw closer to the source, it grows stronger and we
grow weaker. <br>
KIRK: Recommendations. <br>
MCCOY: I have one. I recommend survival. Let's get out of here. <br>
KIRK: This is the Captain. We're on a difficult mission, but it's not
the first time. Our orders do not say stay alive or retreat. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK [OC]: Our mission is to investigate. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: We have no guarantees, but we have a good

massive jolt to the ship.) <br>
KIRK: Are you all right? <br>
SCOTT: Yes. <br>
KIRK: What was that? <br>
SCOTT: I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure. I was trying to recalibrate, and
we went into reverse. <br>
KIRK: Reverse? But that was a forward lurch. How could that happen in
reverse thrust? <br>
SCOTT: I don't know, sir. All I know is that the power levels are down
twelve percent and steadily decreasing. I've never experienced anything
like it. <br>
