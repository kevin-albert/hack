Beverly Crusher, personal log, stardate 44821.3. Began an analysis
today of the respiratory problems being
experienced on the beta moon of Peliar Zel. Finally got an actual
letter from Wesley. Topped the class in exo-biology, but he's still
struggling in Ancient Philosophies. And there's someone new in my life.

turbolift before it stops to pick up another passenger) <br>
DATA: Ambassador Odan, Doctor Crusher. I was just on my way to speak to
you. <br>
CRUSHER: Hello, Data. <br>
DATA: I have completed my study on the atmospheric variations which
have occurred on the moon since the new technology was implemented. <br>
ODAN: Thank you, Commander. That will be most helpful in my efforts to
mediate the quarrel. <br>
DATA: I could go over it with you now. It would not require more than
two hours. <br>
CRUSHER: We do appreciate that, Data, but the Ambassador and I have set
aside this time to analyse the incidence of the lung disease on the
moon's inhabitants. <br>
DATA: Then it is perfect timing, Doctor. What better occasion to
integrate my results into your study? <br>
ODAN: Now that I think about it, you're absolutely right, Commander.
Unfortunately, I'm not feeling very well. Perhaps Doctor Crusher could
get you started inputting your information. I myself must return to my
quarters. <br>
CRUSHER: Ambassador, are you still having those awful headaches? I'd
better bring you a hypospray to take care of it. <br>
ODAN: I would be most grateful. <br>
CRUSHER: Okay. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(exiting the turbolift) <br>
CRUSHER: Put a cold cloth on your forehead, Ambassador. I'll do my best
to be with you shortly. <br>
(the turbolift door closes) <br>
CRUSHER: I'll set you up at the medical monitor, Data. It'll take you a
while to input the figures, won't it? <br>
DATA: At least an hour, but I do not believe much time can be saved by
exhibiting such haste now. <br>
CRUSHER: Data, there are times when every second does count.

with light from a device) <br>
(Later, after the opening credits, Beverly is brushing her hair) <br>
ODAN: Somehow, I had an unnatural fear that Data was going to barge in
and ask to discuss the peripheral effects of magnetospheric energy
taps. <br>
CRUSHER: Well if I don't get back soon and take a look at his
projections, he just might come looking for me. <br>
ODAN: Do you know, when I first met the formidable Doctor Beverly,
what, ten days ago? I thought to myself, this woman is ice through to
her bones. Who would have ever guessed that instead of ice, there is
fire. <br>
CRUSHER: Odan. <br>
ODAN: Stay here, don't go. <br>
CRUSHER: Odan, are we? Is this interfering with your work on the Peliar
Zel problems? <br>
ODAN: Fortunately, I've done about as much as I can until we get there.
Because I just can't seem to keep my mind on my work right now. <br>
CRUSHER: Odan, I have to go. <br>
ODAN: Promise me we'll be together tonight. <br>
CRUSHER: I promise. <br>
(he kisses the inside of her wrist) <br>
ODAN: Then you may go, Doctor Beverly. <br>
CRUSHER: It's just Beverly. <br>
ODAN: Not just Beverly. It's Beverly's smile, it's her kindness, her
beauty within and without. So much more than just Beverly. <br>
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Ambassador Odan. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ready room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODAN [OC]: Yes, Captain? This is Odan. <br>
PICARD: The Federation representative from Peliar Zel has come on
board. Would you care to meet us in the Observation Lounge? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Odan's quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODAN: I'll be right there, Captain.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Observation lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: If the news were encouraging, I assume you
would not be here. <br>
LEKA: I'm afraid you're correct, Captain. The situation's growing
progressively worse. <br>
(Crusher enters) <br>
TROI: Where've you been? <br>
CRUSHER: With a patient. Minor emergency. <br>
(Odan enters through another door) <br>
PICARD: Ambassador Odan, this is Governor Leka Trion of Peliar Zel. <br>
LEKA: Ambassador. thank you for coming. I knew your father. His efforts
helped keep our people at peace for several generations. <br>
ODAN: I would hope to serve you as well as he. <br>
PICARD: Governor. Ambassador. <br>
(all sit) <br>
DATA: I hope Doctor Crusher was able to help you with your headache. <br>
ODAN: Thank you. Actually, she was. <br>
PICARD: Governor Leka has intercepted us before we reach her planet in
order to update us on the situation. <br>
LEKA: The people on our moons have been in discord ever since they
migrated from our planet five centuries ago. To us on the planet
They're like two squabbling children. We try to help settle their
arguments by not taking sides, but this time we are at a loss. <br>
ODAN: I've been studying the information you sent. If I understand
correctly, the people of Alpha moon have found a way to tap directly
into the magnetic field of your planet, and now rely exclusively on
that energy source. <br>
LEKA: Yes, but the Beta moon is now suffering some environmental damage
as a result. <br>
(the monitor shows the Beta moon's orbit is inside that of Alpha) <br>
DATA: My design models suggest that Beta will eventually experience
rising temperatures, erratic tide surges and in general the beginnings
of global warming. <br>
CRUSHER: The impact on the health of the Betan people is clear. There
will be profound medical repercussions. <br>
LEKA: Alpha is unwilling to give up its new-found energy source. Beta
accuses them of intentionally courting genocide. Our efforts to reach a
compromise have failed. And now, we have received intelligence that
both sides are arming for war. If that happens the people of my planet
will begin to take sides, and the outcome can only be disastrous. <br>
PICARD: We will be in orbit around Peliar Zel within six hours. If you
could arrange for the representatives of Alpha and Beta to be there,
then Ambassador Odan could beam directly down to the planet. <br>
ODAN: Excuse me, Captain. I prefer to shuttle to the surface. <br>
LEKA: I would not recommend it. There are many radical factions
involved in this dispute. It would be difficult to guarantee your
safety. <br>
ODAN: I'm sure I'm not the first who has expressed discomfort at the
idea of molecular transport. Thank you, but I prefer to remain intact.
I'll shuttle down. <br>
PICARD: As you wish. <br>
(all leave except Picard and Troi) <br>
PICARD: Counsellor, what is it? <br>
TROI: It's Ambassador Odan. I continually feel fluctuations of emotion
from him. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps it's perfectly normal among the Trill. <br>
TROI: It could be. We know so very little about them. <br>
PICARD: Yes. Quite.

WOMAN: Hi, Deanna. <br>
TROI: Hi. Is that the colgonite astringent you have on your eyes? <br>
CRUSHER: Yes. I guess so. <br>
TROI: I've never tried it. <br>
CRUSHER: Someone just put it on me. <br>
TROI: I didn't know you even came in here. <br>
CRUSHER: I don't. At least, not very often. <br>
TROI: But it feels good to indulge yourself sometimes. <br>
CRUSHER: I guess so. <br>
TROI: Especially when you haven't done so in a while. <br>
CRUSHER: What is that supposed to mean? <br>
TROI: Beverly, you're in love. <br>
CRUSHER: Sometimes I wish you weren't so empathic <br>
TROI: I don't really think it's really a secret. <br>
CRUSHER: It isn't? <br>
TROI: You've been glowing. <br>
CRUSHER: Oh. Must be the astringent. What? <br>
TROI: Nothing. <br>
CRUSHER: Oh, yes, there is. What is it? <br>
TROI: It's just something I sense in Odan. <br>
CRUSHER: What? What do you sense? <br>
TROI: It's just, how well do you really know him? <br>
CRUSHER: I feel I know him better than I've known anyone in my life. Am
I being foolish? I don't think so. And yet, I've only known him for a
couple of weeks. Of course, that could be infatuation, but I am a grown
up and I know the difference between love and infatuation. All I know
is, I haven't felt this way for a long time. <br>
TROI: And you like it. <br>
CRUSHER: I like it.

PICARD: How will you proceed when you're there? <br>
ODAN: Oh, I cannot answer that. I never know until I am into the
situation, meet the people involved. I work very much by instinct, not
by pre-arranged plan. <br>
PICARD: It seems to work well for you. <br>
ODAN: Well, I do like to go into a situation as well-informed as
possible, and I must say that your staff has been quite helpful in
briefing me on the problems down here. Particularly Doctor Crusher. <br>
PICARD: My staff is quite capable. I'm glad they've been useful. <br>
ODAN: Your Doctor Beverly is an extraordinary person, both as a
scientist and as a woman. <br>
PICARD: Yes, I'm sure that's true. Well, shall we make our way to the

cerebrospinal fluid at forty six percent. <br>
OGAWA: Sedimentation rate is twenty nine, but his lymphocytes are still
intact. <br>

survive. It has always been this way. The Trill are a joined species. A
host and a symbiont, and in this fashion we have survived for
millennia. <br>
CRUSHER: You're dying. What can I do? <br>
ODAN: The host body is dying. You must contact the Trill quickly. Tell
them I need another host. They will send a replacement. I know this is
difficult to accept, but I beg you, Doctor Beverly, help me. This
mission must be completed.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: Odan's host body died of the injuries just
over an hour ago. But the symbiont being, Odan, is still alive. Odan is
the one who negotiated the last treaty, but the man everyone thought
was his father was just another host body. <br>
RIKER: And the reason Odan refused the transporter? <br>
CRUSHER: It would have damaged the symbiont. <br>
PICARD: We've contacted the Trill. Another host will be here in forty
hours. <br>
CRUSHER: I've placed Odan in stasis. He can survive another hour, maybe
two, but not beyond that. <br>
DATA: Would it be possible for me to serve as a temporary carrier? <br>
CRUSHER: No, Data. The relationship requires a biological being. <br>
PICARD: We are at a desperate impasse in the Peliar system. The attack
on the shuttlecraft has inflamed the dispute. <br>
TROI: Who was responsible? <br>
PICARD: No one will admit anything. Each side accuses the other and the
threats are mounting. We need Odan. <br>
RIKER: Doctor, could a human host carry him? <br>
CRUSHER: I believe so. From Odan's description of the process it should
be possible. But I don't have <br>
RIKER: Then I volunteer. <br>
CRUSHER: There's been no precedent for a human host. I couldn't
guarantee what might happen. <br>

CRUSHER: You know, Deanna, the first man I ever loved unconditionally
was named Stefan. He was a soccer player, and I would watch him as he
would race down the field and I thought my heart would stop because he
was so beautiful. We married and had three children. Twin boys, Andrew
and Alexander, and then later a little girl, Jennifer. Stefan became an
artist, very famous. He created huge, breathtaking, metal sculptures.
He came to adore me as much as I worshipped him. In my daydreams at
least. Stefan was eleven and I was eight. He never even knew I existed.
Oh, Deanna, I loved Odan. I'm sure of it. I had no doubts, no fears,
but what it was I loved? His eyes? His hands? His mouth? They're gone.
If that was all it was, I should mourn him and go on. But it was more
than that. I felt completely free with him. Unguarded. At ease with
myself. There were so many things that made him special to me. Where
are they? Are they still here, alive in Will Riker? I look at Will and
I see someone I've known for years. A kind of brother. But inside, is
he really Odan? Help me, please. <br>

me. <br>
TROI: The first man I ever loved was my father. He was strong and tall.
He carried me when the ground was muddy. He chased away the monsters
that hid under my bed at night. And he sang to me, and kept me safe.
And he went away. What I wouldn't give to hear those songs again. To
feel his arms protect me. I never will, but I can still feel his warmth
and his love as though he were here with me. If you can feel those
things from the man we know as Will Riker, accept them. Accept the

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 44823.8. Representatives of
the two moons of Peliar Zel have agreed to come on board to meet the
new Ambassador Odan. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Observation lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: White count is elevated. It's getting
higher and higher every time I read it. Are you in pain? <br>
RIKER: Not much. <br>
PICARD: Ambassador, we can stall the representatives. <br>
RIKER: They would see that as deception. I must meet with them. <br>
PICARD: But surely, to present yourself in this condition is not going
to help our cause. <br>
RIKER: I promise you, Captain, they will never know that I am ill. <br>
WORF: Captain, the emissaries. <br>
LEKA: May I present Kalin Trose of Alpha Moon, and Lathal Bine of Beta
Moon. <br>
KALIN: Thank you for receiving us, Captain. <br>
LATHAL: Is this Ambassador Odan? <br>
RIKER: Lathal Bine. It was your aunt who represented Beta thirty years
ago. <br>
LATHAL: That is correct. <br>
RIKER: She was a formidable woman. I had the utmost respect for her. <br>
KALIN: And who was it who spoke for Alpha so long ago? <br>
RIKER: That was you, of course, Kalin Trose. Then you were a young man,
bristling with passion and zeal, yet wise enough to understand that
your people needed peace to ensure their future. <br>
KALIN: And how did you manage to achieve a compromise between that
young man and the iron willed woman of Beta Moon? <br>
RIKER: They agreed to trade places for a week, to understand each
other's situation with more informed eyes. After that an agreement came
swiftly. <br>
KALIN: Nothing that you have said is beyond what a school child could
learn in a history book. <br>
RIKER: What is not commonly known that during those negotiations, you,
Kalin Trose, quelled a plot by a radical from your moon who was
attempting to assassinate the Beta delegate. <br>
KALIN: It is true. <br>
LATHAL: Perhaps he was wiser in his youth than he is now. Odan, you
must convince him to stop. <br>
RIKER: Will you accept me? Will you allow me to work with you? <br>
LATHAL: Yes. <br>
RIKER: And Alpha moon? <br>
KALIN: I will consider it, but I must consult others. <br>
LATHAL: This is a typical tactic. He is an obstructionist. You can see
that. <br>
RIKER: Kalin Trose, you may confer with your people, but we must have
your answer within eight hours. <br>
KALIN: You shall have it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: His vital functions are overworked. His
immune system is under attack. I can only guess that he's suffering
from classic rejection syndrome. <br>
PICARD: Is there any treatment you can give him? <br>
CRUSHER: I can administer an immunosuppressant. That could help relieve
the symptoms but it Can't correct the underlying cause. There is a
foreign organism in his body. Medical school didn't exactly prepare me
for situations like this. <br>
PICARD: You're doing all you can. <br>
CRUSHER: Don't worry about me, Captain. I'm fine. <br>
PICARD: Ambassador, when you feel up to it, would you join me in my
Ready room? <br>
RIKER: Of course. <br>
(Picard leaves) <br>
CRUSHER: I'm giving you something that should help with the pain. At
least for a little while. <br>
RIKER: The pain's gone. Thank you. <br>
(he takes her arm) <br>
CRUSHER: Please don't. <br>
RIKER: Please let me touch you, just for a moment. <br>
(he leans in for a kiss) <br>
CRUSHER: No. Please.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: It was a fast decision, which we must take
as positive. The Alphan representative has agreed, however reluctantly.
to let you mediate the dispute. <br>
RIKER: I knew they would. They are reasonable people, they're just
trapped in their own anger. <br>
PICARD: I have no doubt, however, that they will bolt if something goes
wrong in the discussion. <br>
RIKER: Then it's my job to see nothing goes wrong. Did I said something
wrong, Captain Picard? <br>
PICARD: No, it's just that for a moment you sounded more like Will
Riker. We have received information that the new host will arrive in
eighteen hours. Will you be all right until then? <br>
RIKER: The medication Doctor Beverly gave me has helped. I will find a
way to keep going. </font></p>

structure. <br>
RIKER: Never mind. <br>
(Beverly stares at the red rose, then makes a decision) <br>
RIKER: Come in. <br>
CRUSHER: I thought I should see how you were doing. If you needed
another hypospray? <br>
RIKER: I don't think so. The symptoms haven't returned. <br>
CRUSHER: Oh. Well, that's good. <br>
RIKER: Yes. <br>
CRUSHER: Tomorrow's an important day. Do you feel ready for it? <br>
RIKER: I'll be fine. I've been preparing. <br>
CRUSHER: That's good. <br>
RIKER: Yes. <br>
CRUSHER: I'll check your vital signs in the morning before the
representatives get here. <br>
RIKER: I don't want them knowing I'm taking any medication. <br>
CRUSHER: Maybe you could schedule a series of breaks. <br>
RIKER: That's good. <br>
CRUSHER: Yes. <br>
RIKER: Beverly, I want you. If you're going to leave, you'd better go
right now. <br>
CRUSHER: I'm not leaving.

two. <br>

PICARD: Ambassador, it's clear you're in pain. You can't get through
the next hours without help. <br>
RIKER: I must. <br>
CRUSHER: Are the injections damaging to the host's body, Riker's body? <br>
RIKER: Yes. We can't put him through any further risk. <br>
CRUSHER: But how can you function, conduct the meeting? <br>
RIKER: I'll manage. <br>
PICARD: We'll respect your wishes. <br>
RIKER: One more thing. I will conduct the mediations today, but at the
end of today, regardless of the outcome, I must be removed from Riker's
body. Even if the new host has not arrived. <br>
CRUSHER: But you wouldn't survive. <br>
RIKER: Riker will not survive if I am removed. He has done enough. Your

WORF: Captain, I am receiving a message from the ship carrying the
Trill host. <br>
CRUSHER: Are they here, Worf? <br>
WORF: No, they are experiencing difficulty. They do not anticipate
their arrival for another nine hours. <br>
CRUSHER: Nine hours. <br>

RIKER: It was worth it. <br>

RIKER: They will not go to war. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, see that the representatives are safely
transported off the ship. Ensign, set a course to intercept with the
Trill ship. Prepare to go to warp nine. <br>

signs have stabilised and he's sleeping now. <br>
PICARD: How is Odan? <br>
CRUSHER: I've placed him in stasis. He's fine for the moment. <br>
PICARD: You need some rest, Doctor. <br>
CRUSHER: No. If Odan is to survive, he needs to be implanted in the new
host as soon as he arrives. I'll wait here. <br>
PICARD: It'll be some time. <br>

successful. There were no difficulties in assimilation. <br>

KAREEL: I've never felt better, except once or twice. My poor Beverly.
This has been so hard for you. I want to thank you for your caring, for
your standing by me. <br>
CRUSHER: I congratulate you. You averted a war that would have cost
many lives. <br>
KAREEL: Yes. It seems as though everything has turned out for the best.
And yes, I am still Odan, and I still love you. I cannot imagine that
ever changing. <br>
CRUSHER: I am glad that you're all right. <br>
KAREEL: Is there to be nothing more? <br>
CRUSHER: Perhaps it is a human failing, but we are not accustomed to
these kinds of changes. I can't keep up. How long will you have this
host? What would the next one be? I can't live with that kind of
uncertainty. Perhaps, someday, our ability to love won't be so limited.
<br>
KAREEL: I understand. <br>
CRUSHER: Odan, I do love you. Please remember that. <br>
