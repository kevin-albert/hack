<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: The Dominion won't attack Earth. <br>
SITAK: How can you be sure? <br>
SISKO: Because Earth isn't the key to the Alpha Quadrant. The wormhole
is. And whoever controls Deep Space Nine controls the wormhole. <br>
O'BRIEN: Target locked. <br>
DAX: Fire. <br>
(KaBOOM) <br>
KIRA: Execute Rom? <br>
WEYOUN: He committed an act of terrorism against the Dominion. <br>
ROM: You've got to finish what I started. The fate of the entire Alpha
Quadrant rests in your hands. <br>
QUARK: What happens if I get caught? <br>
(Odo and the female shape-shifter Link.) <br>
ROSS: If those Dominion reinforcements come through the wormhole we'll
have lost everything. <br>
SISKO: We take the ships we have, fight our way to Deep Space Nine and
destroy that anti-graviton emitter. It's our only hope. <br>
KIRA: Dukat is bringing down the minefield, the Federation is about to
be overrun by Dominion reinforcements and Weyoun has ordered Rom's
execution. <br>
ODO: I'm sorry. <br>
KIRA: We are way, way past sorry. <br>
O'BRIEN: It's a large Dominion fleet. Twelve hundred and fifty four
ships. <br>
BASHIR: They outnumber us two to one. <br>
SISKO: There's an old saying, fortune favours the bold. Well, I guess
we're about to find out.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>And now the conclusion.</i>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SISKO: Sisko to all ships. Cruiser and Galaxy
wings, drop to half impulse. You too, Commander. <br>
DAX: Half impulse. <br>
GARAK: I feel sorry for the Klingons. They're going to miss a very
interesting fight. <br>
O'BRIEN: I have a feeling we're going to miss having them. <br>
SISKO: Forget the Klingons. Our job is to get to Deep Space Nine and
prevent the Dominion reinforcements from coming through the wormhole,
and that's what we're going to do. Attack fighters, tactical pattern
Theta. Concentrate your fire on the Cardassian ships, and then split
off into squadrons and run like hell. <br>
NOG: Why is he only targeting the Cardassian ships? <br>
GARAK: He's hoping to get them to break formation and so they'll after
the Federation fighters. He knows the Jem'Hadar will stand their
ground, but the Cardassians just might get angry enough to take the
bait. <br>
NOG: Which would open a hole we can punch through. <br>
GARAK: You're getting quite an education. <br>
NOG: Attack fighters in Theta formation. Cruiser and Galaxy wings at
half impulse. <br>
SISKO: Sisko to attack fighters. Prepare to engage on my command. <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: Aye, sir. <br>
O'BRIEN: Cannon to the right of them, cannon to the left of them,
cannon in front of them, volley'd and thunder'd. <br>
BASHIR: Storm'd at with shot and shell, Boldly they rode and well into
the jaws of death. Into the mouth of hell rode the six hundred. <br>
NOG: Whatever it is you two are reciting, I wish you'd stop. <br>
O'BRIEN: Steady, Ensign. It's just a poem. <br>
(<a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-charge-of-the-light-brigade/" target="_blank">Here's the full text, if you need
it</a>.) <br>
NOG: It's not the poem that's bothering me. <br>
O'BRIEN: Stop worrying about those ships. Focus on your work. That's
what I do. <br>
BASHIR: You should listen to him, Ensign. He's a professional. <br>
SISKO: Attack fighters full impulse. Fire at will. <br>
(And so it begins. The battle continues during the opening titles.) <br>
O'BRIEN: They're not taking the bait. <br>
SISKO: Ensign, send in the second wave. Tell them to keep targeting the
Cardassians. <br>
NOG: Aye, sir. Second wave on its way. Third and fourth waves on hot
standby. <br>
SISKO: Mister O'Brien, have Destroyer units two and six move in closer.
They need more cover fire. And tell Captains Diego and Reynolds to stay
alert. They may try to outflank us.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Dukat and co are watching the battle on the Ops
table.) <br>
DUKAT: It's very clever strategy. But I'd expect nothing less from
Captain Sisko. <br>
WEYOUN: The Captain is a very clever man. <br>
DUKAT: You do see it, don't you? <br>
WEYOUN: Of course I do. <br>
DUKAT: Well then, perhaps you'd like to explain Captain Sisko's
strategy to the Founder yourself. <br>
WEYOUN: I could never hope to match your eloquence. <br>
DUKAT: True. Sisko is trying to provoke us into opening a hole in our
lines. He's determined to get here and stop us from taking down this
minefield. Now I plan to give Sisko his opening and then close it on
him. <br>
WEYOUN: What about the minefield? Are we still on schedule? <br>
DUKAT: We should be able to detonate the mines in eight hours. <br>
FOUNDER: Good. <br>
WEYOUN: Eight hours. I'll hold you to that, Dukat. <br>
(The Founder and Weyoun leave.) <br>
DAMAR: I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock.
And his Founder with him. <br>
DUKAT: Now, now, Damar, that's no way to talk about our valued allies.
Not until this war is over, anyway. <br>
DAMAR: Sir, there is one other thing. <br>
DUKAT: Make it brief. <br>
DAMAR: I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station.
The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. <br>
DUKAT: By enemy, I assume you're referring to Rom's associates? <br>
DAMAR: I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the
station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. <br>
DUKAT: What are you proposing? <br>
DAMAR: That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the
wormhole is reopened. <br>
DUKAT: It's a wise precaution. But our Bajoran allies might object to
an arrest without cause. If anyone asks, we're merely holding them for
questioning. And Damar, make sure they're not harmed in any way. Major
Kira is important to my daughter. And to me. <br>
DAMAR: Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her
own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. <br>
DUKAT: For what reason? <br>
DAMAR: To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And
neither should you. <br>
DUKAT: Are you accusing my daughter of being a saboteur? <br>
DAMAR: I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with
Major Kira. <br>
DUKAT: That will be all, Damar. <br>
DAMAR: She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be
your daughter. <br>
DUKAT: But she is my daughter. That may mean nothing to you, but it
means everything to me. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LEETA: I heard the Federation fleet has been
ambushed. <br>
QUARK: I heard two Cardassian soldiers saying the fleet was completely
destroyed. <br>
JAKE: Don't believe everything you hear. <br>
KIRA: Jake's right. Sisko'll get here. The question is, will he get
here soon enough? <br>
QUARK: He's only got seven hours before they detonate the minefield and
start bringing the reinforcements through the wormhole. <br>
JAKE: We've got to stop them. <br>
LEETA: How? <br>
KIRA: What if we cut off the power supply to the main computer? Shut
down the whole station. <br>
QUARK: Oh great. That would put me out of business altogether. <br>
JAKE: It would also keep them from detonating the mines. <br>
QUARK: Okay, so we shut down the main computer. How? <br>
KIRA: A bomb. <br>
QUARK: A bomb? What kind of bomb? <br>
KIRA: Leave that to me. It'll be crude, but effective. <br>
QUARK: The main computer is in the central core. It's too heavily
guarded. You'll never be able to smuggle a bomb into there. <br>
(Quark leaves) <br>
KIRA: I'll plant the bomb. All we need to do is distract the guards. <br>
DAMAR [OC]: In here. Secure the doors. <br>
(Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) <br>
DAMAR: Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends
for us. <br>
KIRA: I'm off duty, Damar. What do you want? <br>
DAMAR: I want you to come with us. All three of you. <br>
KIRA: Where? <br>
DAMAR: To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. <br>
JAKE: What kind of questions? <br>
DAMAR: You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try
something. Nothing would make me happier. <br>
KIRA: Don't worry. It'll be all right. <br>
DAMAR: Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta)
You certainly don't.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAMAR: I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is
persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent
against us. <br>
DUKAT: Well, his persistence is about to pay off. Let's give him his
reward, shall we? Have a half dozen squadrons break formation and go
after those fighters. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: Captain, two squadrons of Cardassian
attack ships are breaking formation. They're going after our fighters. <br>
GARAK: They're taking the bait. We've opened a hole in their lines. <br>
SISKO: Have we? <br>
DAX: Sir, do you see those Galor class destroyers? <br>
SISKO: I see them. <br>
BASHIR: It's a trap. <br>
SISKO: It is also an opportunity and we may not get another one.
Ensign, have Galaxy wings nine one and nine three engage those
destroyers. All other ships, head for that opening. Anyone who gets
through doesn't stop until they reach Deep Space Nine. <br>
(In they go, Galaxy-class firepower helping make the gap wide enough
for the Defiant and her companions.) <br>
GARAK: Congratulations, Captain. You wanted them angry, they're angry. <br>
SISKO: The Magellan and the Venture are supposed to be protecting our
starboard flanks. They're in too tight. Ensign, tell fighter squadrons
six, seven and eight to <br>
NOG: Sir, I can't get through to anybody. Communications are down. <br>
O'BRIEN: They're jamming our signals by generating a rotating EM pulse.

WEYOUN: Perhaps if you didn't talk so much, your throat wouldn't get so
dry. <br>
DUKAT: Cardassians do like to talk. I suppose it can be a failing at
times. <br>
(Dukat offers Weyoun a glass of kanar.) <br>
WEYOUN: No. <br>
DUKAT: To the conquerors of the Federation. <br>
WEYOUN: Aren't you being a bit premature? <br>
DUKAT: I don't think so. Not with twenty eight hundred Dominion ships
waiting to come through that wormhole. <br>
WEYOUN: Those ships aren't going to be here for another five hours, and
need I remind you a lot can happen in that amount of time. <br>
DUKAT: Tell me, Weyoun, have you ever been diagnosed as anhedonic? <br>
WEYOUN: You think I'm incapable of experiencing joy just because I'm
cautious? <br>
DUKAT: We didn't defeat the Federation by being cautious. <br>
WEYOUN: We haven't defeated it yet. And even if we do, it's only the
beginning. Holding on to a prize as vast as the Federation isn't going
to be easy. It's going to require an enormous number of ships, a
massive occupation army and constant vigilance. <br>
DUKAT: I look forward to it. <br>
WEYOUN: I'm sure you also looked forward to occupying Bajor and we all
know what a disappointment that was. <br>
DUKAT: On Bajor I merely implemented policy, I didn't make it. If I
had, things would have turned out quite differently. <br>
WEYOUN: If you ask me, the key to holding the Federation is Earth. If
there's going to be an organised resistance against us, its birthplace
will be there. <br>
DUKAT: You could be right. <br>
WEYOUN: Then our first step is be to eradicate its population. It's the
only way. <br>
DUKAT: You can't do that. <br>
WEYOUN: Why not? <br>
DUKAT: Because! A true victory is to make your enemy see they were
wrong to oppose you in the first place. To force them to acknowledge
your greatness. <br>
WEYOUN: Then you kill them? <br>
DUKAT: Only if it's necessary. <br>
WEYOUN: I had no idea. <br>
DUKAT: Perhaps the biggest disappointment in my life is that the
Bajoran people still refuse to appreciate how lucky they were to have
me as their liberator. I protected them in so many ways, cared for them
as if they were my own children. But to this day, is there a single
statue of me on Bajor? <br>
WEYOUN: I would guess not. <br>
DUKAT: And you'd be right. Take Captain Sisko, an otherwise
intelligent, perceptive man. Even he refuses to grant me the respect I
deserve. <br>
(Dukat drops the baseball onto the floor.) <br>
DUKAT: You find that amusing? <br>
WEYOUN: Not at all. I find it fascinating. <br>
DUKAT: Laugh all you want. History will prove me right. </font></p>

FOUNDER: The Link means more. <br>
ODO: That's what I keep telling myself, but somehow I can't quite
believe it. <br>
FOUNDER: You asked me for clarity, Odo. I gave it to you. Now you must
accept it. It's Major Kira, isn't it? You still have strong feelings
for her. She doesn't deserve your loyalty, Odo. You cannot allow a
