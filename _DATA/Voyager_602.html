<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Things are going Bang! behind Torres.)<br>TORRES:
Torres to Voyager. I could use a little help here. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: What's your status? <br>
TORRES: I'm approaching your position, but that ion storm blew out my
deflector field. I've lost helm control and I'm venting plasma from the
port nacelle. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: We're modifying a tractor pulse to slow you down. <br>
TORRES: Acknowledged. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: The arresting fields are in place. You're clear to land.
<br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Hold on, B'Elanna. This is going to be bumpy. <br>(The
shuttlecraft bounces into the shuttlebay and skids to a halt. Not
having any seatbelts, Torres lurches forward onto the console. Paris
enters.)<br>PARIS:
B'Elanna? Are you alive? <br>
TORRES: You tell me. <br>
PARIS: You've got a mild concussion. <br>
TORRES: That's the best thing that's happened to me all day. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Ready

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
When I give you an order, I expect you to follow it. I told you to
return to Voyager, not chase the probe into the centre of an ion storm.
<br>
TORRES: We only have one multispatial probe. I didn't want to lose it.
<br>
JANEWAY: We only have one B'Elanna Torres. I don't want to lose her,
either. <br>
TORRES: Understood. <br>
JANEWAY: Lanna, I'm glad you made it back in one piece, <br>
TORRES: Did you just call me Lanna? <br>
JANEWAY: I suppose I did. <br>
TORRES: That's what my mother used to call me. <br>

Come in. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Feeling better? <br>
TORRES: I've felt worse. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I found something you might be interested in. It's what my
ancestors called a monkey wrench. It was lodged in your port nacelle. <br>
TORRES: How did it get there? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Judging by your sensor logs, it looks like you ran into it
after your deflector field collapsed, but the big question is, how did
it get in this quadrant? <br>
TORRES: What do you mean? (She takes the piece of metal from Chakotay,
and sees the insignia on it. A circle with one big elongated diamond
and two small curved triangles sticking out from it.)<br>TORRES: What? It's Klingon! <br>
CHAKOTAY: And it's old. That's about all we know. Looks like the
Klingons beat Starfleet to the Delta Quadrant by a few hundred years.
You may be holding the most important archaeological find in Klingon
history. <br>
TORRES: Remind me to plant a flag on behalf of the Empire. You know,
the simplest explanation is that the Borg assimilated a Bird of Prey
somewhere in the Alpha Quadrant and they blew it out an airlock on
their way home. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe so. In any case, it makes a nice souvenir. <br>(Chakotay
leaves it with her. Torres puts it down on a table and goes to the
replicator. When she turns back, blood is pouring from the insignia.
Then she hears a multitude of voices, until it all vanishes again.)<i><br></i>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The metal is on a stand.)<br>TORRES:
Harry, it bled. Ut screamed. There's got to be some explanation. <br>
KIM: Hey, I've got one for you. You hit your head harder than you
thought. <br>
TORRES: I wasn't hallucinating. Now run a submolecular scan. <br>
KIM: How many more scans are we going to run? There's nothing there. No
fluid or vapour residue. <br>
TORRES: We may find some irregularities at the atomic level. <br>
KIM: It's a hunk of metal. What you heard may have had nothing to do
with this artefact. Maybe the comm. system picked up some stray signal
from a pulsar. I don't know. <br>
TORRES: A pulsar that speaks Klingon? <br>
KIM: Okay, B'Elanna, there probably is some explanation for what
happened. But it's oh three hundred hours. I'm tired, you're tired.
Let's just stick this thing in a containment field and deal with it in
the morning. <br>
NEELIX: Ah! Just the Daughter of the Empire I've been looking for. I
wanted to be the first to congratulate you on your discovery of the
Klingon artefact. <br>
TORRES: Neelix, I ran into it with a shuttle. <br>
NEELIX: Some of the greatest discoveries in Klingon history were
accidents. When Sarpek the Fearless unearthed the Knife of Kirom he was
searching for his lost targ. Isn't that amazing? I've been doing some
research. <br>
TORRES: Why? <br>
NEELIX: Well, I'm planning a celebration. This must be the treasure. <br>
TORRES: Neelix, look, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but since I'm the
only Klingon on board, there's really no point in throwing a party. <br>
NEELIX: Oh, nonsense. This artefact isn't just a testament to Klingon
spirit. It's a piece of the Alpha Quadrant. A symbol of Voyager's home.
And that's just as worthy of celebration and song as finding some old
knife. <br>
KIM: The man's got a point. <br>
NEELIX: And besides, I've already replicated five barrels of bloodwine.
I'm not going to let them go to waste. Festivities begin at nineteen
hundred hours. Oh, er, I almost forgot. As guest of honour, you're
going to be expected to say a few words on behalf of your people. <br>
KIM: It sounds like you've got a big day ahead of you. You should
probably get some rest. <br>
TORRES: All right, all right, let's call it a night. <br>
KIM: Thank you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Tuvok's
quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TUVOK:
Do not underestimate the power of the mind. The artefact was a catalyst
for your already active imagination. It served as an unwelcome reminder
of your ancestry. The self-loathing you experience when you look in the
mirror and see a Klingon. <br>
TORRES: Who said anything about self-loathing? <br>
TUVOK: You despise being Klingon. It's no secret. What you experienced
in your quarters was a subconscious manifestation of that hatred. The
blood in your veins, the voices of your ancestors, all symbols of your
Klingon heritage. <br>
TORRES: And when the blood disappeared that was, what, me trying to
vaporise that part of myself? <br>
TUVOK: Yes, but the essence of who you are, the artefact itself,
remained. <br>
TORRES: And the moral of the story is? <br>
TUVOK: Quite simple. That despite your efforts to become something
else, whether it be Starfleet or Maquis, your Klingon nature continues
to assert itself. <br>
TORRES: That's an intriguing theory. <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps we should forego your meditation in favour of a
different exercise. <br>
TORRES: Fine by me. (Tuvok fetches a bat'leth.)<br>TORRES: This should be interesting. <br>
TUVOK: Feel the weight of the bat'leth in your hands. Describe the
first thought that enters your mind. <br>
TORRES: It's a clumsy weapon. Overstated, like everything else Klingon.
<br>
TUVOK: You can't see the elegance of its design because of your hatred.
<br>
TORRES: I don't hate Klingons. <br>
TUVOK: It's a warrior's blade, crafted for precision and balance.
Observe. <br>(Tuvok
twirls the big blade around his body and head, ending up with the long
curved edge inches from Torres' neck. The final set of fast moves end
up cutting her cheek.)<br>
TORRES: Is this your idea of therapy? <br>
TUVOK: Listen to yourself whine like a Ferengi. <br>
TORRES: PetaQ! <br>
TUVOK: You're not worthy of the blood in your veins. A true Klingon
would try to kill me where I stand. <br>
TORRES: What the hell has gotten into you? <br>
TUVOK: This exercise is over. You are dismissed, Lieutenant, and take
your dishonour with you. </font></p>

SEVEN: I fail to see the merit of learning a Klingon drinking song. <br>
EMH: It's not about drinking, Seven. It's about saluting the noble
deeds of our ancestors and honouring those who fell in battle. Think,
Qapla'. Think, long live the Empire! <br>
SEVEN: Think again. <br>

TORRES: He said, eat this or he'll force it down the gullet of your
corpse. <br>
NEELIX: No offence. <br>
PARIS: Oh, none taken. So this is replicated, right? <br>
NEELIX: Unfortunately. <br>
PARIS: And how do you get it to move? <br>
NEELIX: I used a kinesthetic agent to give it a little oomph. <br>
TORRES: Is it just me, or has everyone gone Klingon-happy? <br>
PARIS: Oh, come on, B'Elanna. They're all doing this for you. <br>
TORRES: Well then, they don't know me very well, and if you even think
of joining in on this embrace your heritage nonsense, I swear, I'll rip
out your tongue and wear it as a belt. <br>
PARIS: Oh no, there's not a lot of Klingon in you. <br>
TORRES: I inherited the forehead and the bad attitude. That's it. She
would have loved all this. <br>
PARIS: Your mother? <br>
TORRES: She was so obsessed with Klingon ritual, myths. It used to
drive my father and me crazy. Did I ever tell you that she put me in a
Klingon monastery? <br>
PARIS: You're kidding. <br>
TORRES: It was after their marriage ended. She pulled me out of the
Federation school in order to teach me honour and discipline. <br>
PARIS: Out of the plasma cooker, into the fire. <br>
TORRES: She prayed to Kahless every day to guide me in the ways of the
warrior. I guess he wasn't listening. <br>
JANEWAY: Ladies and gentlemen. Could I have your attention, please? I
hate to interrupt the festivities, but before I turn the floor over to
our resident Klingon, I'd like to say a few words. This is a great day
for the Klingon Empire. A day when we honour their ancestors, those
warriors whose deeds of valour and glory led them to the Delta Quadrant. <br>(To Torres, Janeway's words get very, very slow. A red light is glowing behind her.)<br>JANEWAY:
May they live on in song and story. (Torres turns to see an altar and a
Klingon warrior with a bat'leth who walks past her. Another stands
behind Janeway and raises a dagger.)<br>
TORRES: Captain! <br>(The
Klingon stabs Janeway in the back. The other slashes the EMH and Seven
through the abdomen with the bat'leth. Chakotay and Kim die next, then
finally Paris.)<br>

KORTAR: B'Elanna, daughter of Miral. It's not your time. <br>
TORRES: How do you know my name? <br>

the first. You were a child. Your mother took you to the Sea of Gatan.
Your curiosity was as deep as the water. <br>

KORTAR: When your mother breathed life back into your lungs, she told
you about me. <br>
TORRES: So you're supposed to be Kortar. <br>
KORTAR: Ah. You remember me. <br>
TORRES: I remember the myth of Kortar, the first Klingon. He destroyed
the gods who created him. <br>
KORTAR: And as punishment, I was condemned to ferry the souls of the
dishonoured to Gre'thor. <br>(Torres spots a bat'leth hanging on a mast, and sidles towards it.)<br>
TORRES: I may have believed in you as a child, but not anymore. <br>

CHAKOTAY: Would you like to talk about it? <br>
TORRES: Yes. And no. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Let me know when you decide. <br>
TORRES: I don't know how to say this without sounding crazy. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Try. <br>
TORRES: Do you believe in an afterlife? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I accept there are things in the universe than can't be
scanned with a tricorder. What happened to you out there? <br>
TORRES: I think I died. I died, and I was on the Barge of the Dead in
the Klingon afterlife. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Klingon mythology has been ingrained in you since you were a
child. It's not surprising you experienced some of those images while
you were unconscious. <br>
TORRES: I saw my mother, Chakotay. If it was real, then she's dead. <br>
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna, your mother, the Barge of the Dead, those are just
symbols. It's your subconscious mind trying to tell you something. <br>
TORRES: Tell me what? That my mother is going to hell? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You need time to digest what you experienced. You have to
interpret the symbols and search for their meaning. <br>
TORRES: What if there is no symbolism to interpret? What if the
afterlife is real? I'm an engineer. My whole life I've immersed myself
in science and schematics. But what if it's time to start looking
beyond that? <br>
CHAKOTAY: My grandfather used to think he could transform himself into
a wolf so that he could venture out to explore the spirit realm. It was
real to him, as real as what your experience was to you, but that
doesn't mean he grew hair all over his body and walked around on all
fours. <br>
TORRES: My mother has been on my mind a lot lately. We just had a big
anniversary. It's been ten years since we talked. But it was so real. I
could taste the blood in the air. I could feel the wind. I was seasick
from the rocking of the boat. </font></p>

Hi. <br>

PARIS: Find anything? <br>
TORRES: You don't want to know. <br>
PARIS: Oh, come on. It can't be that bad. <br>
TORRES: You want to bet? I found out why my mother is on her way to
Gre'thor. It's because I sent her there. <br>
PARIS: What do you mean? <br>
TORRES: The sins of the child. She's being punished for my dishonour. I
turned my back on everything Klingon, and now she has to pay the price. <br>
PARIS: B'Elanna, you can't even be sure your mother is dead, much less
blame yourself for what happens to her in some afterlife. <br>
TORRES: Look at this. The eleventh tome of Klavek. It's a story about
Kahless returning from the dead still bearing a wound from the
afterlife. A warning that what he experienced wasn't a dream. The same
thing happened to me. <br>
PARIS: B'Elanna. <br>
TORRES: And the only reason Kahless was in the afterlife to begin with
was to rescue his brother from the Barge of the Dead and deliver him to
Sto-Vo-Kor. <br>
PARIS: Okay. <br>
TORRES: Don't you see? I have a chance to rescue my mother, if I can
accept responsibility for her dishonour before she passes through the
gates of Gre'thor. I have to go back. <br>

JANEWAY: B'Elanna, I'm not going to let you turn this into a debate
about freedom of worship. <br>
TORRES: But that's what it is. <br>
JANEWAY: There's a limit to how far I'll let religious practices go
aboard this ship. If your belief system required you to sacrifice a
child to your gods, I wouldn't allow that either. <br>

revisit the Barge of Death, and you're telling me what's absurd? Bottom

was to Klingon honour. I know that we haven't always seen eye to eye,
but despite our differences you helped me become a good officer. And I'd
like to think that you're proud of me for it. <br>

Mother. <br>
MIRAL: Stay away. You are an illusion. You're a Kos'Karii trying to
lure me away<br>
TORRES: Mother, it's me. It's me. <br>
MIRAL: B'Elanna? Then you died as well? <br>
TORRES: I've come to lift your dishonour. <br>
MIRAL: But you don't believe in Sto-Vo-Kor. <br>
TORRES: A lot's happened since the last time I saw you. I've changed. <br>
MIRAL: Not enough. It was you who brought this damnation upon me. <br>
TORRES: If you hadn't tried to force me to become a warrior <br>
MIRAL: I tried to guide you in the ways of a Klingon. <br>
TORRES: You tried a little too hard. <br>
MIRAL: If you had listened to me when you were younger, we wouldn't be
on the Barge of the Dead. You were always running away. <br>
TORRES: You drove me away. The same way you drove away my father. <br>
MIRAL: He abandoned us. <br>
TORRES: You pushed him to the point where he couldn't bear to be around
anything Klingon, including me. <br>
MIRAL: I wanted to give you honour. And if you had understood that, I
would be not be on my way to Gre'thor. <br>
TORRES: We're on the Barge of the Dead and we're still having the same
argument we were having ten years ago. Look, if I have dishonoured you,
I am truly sorry. <br>
MIRAL: Are you? You have too much anger in your heart to be sorry. <br>
TORRES: Oh, we don't have time for this if we're going to perform the
transference. <br>
MIRAL: Is that how you intend to lift my dishonour? By taking my place?
<br>
TORRES: Oh, don't worry. I have no intention of being on this barge
when it gets to Gre'thor. We've got just enough time to perform the
ritual before my crew resuscitates me. <br>
MIRAL: Oh. I should have known you'd choose the easy way. <br>
TORRES: What are you talking about? Do you know the risks I've taken to
save you? <br>
MIRAL: You still understand nothing about being a Klingon. I would
rather face damnation with what little honour you have left me, than
cheat my way into Sto-Vo-Kor. <br>
BROK'TAN: There she is. Bring them. </font></p>

The mongrel child has returned. <br>
TORRES: I'm here to take my mother's place. <br>
MIRAL: B'Elanna! <br>
KORTAR: You wish to claim her dishonour as your own? <br>
TORRES: Yes. <br>
KORTAR: You're willing to die for her? <br>
TORRES: Yes. Release her to Sto-Vo-Kor. <br>
MIRAL: No! <br>
KORTAR: Keep her quiet! <br>BROK'TAN: Silence. <br>(He puts his hand over Miral's mouth.)<br>KORTAR:&nbsp; It's not your decision. She has the right to
reclaim your honour. Once we've reached Gre'thor and you are within its
gates, I will release her. <br>
TORRES: No. Now. <br>
KORTAR: You're very impatient. Time must be slipping away in the living
world. You're concerned that your friends will revive you before you
complete your deception. Did you really think that I could be fooled so
easily? <br>
TORRES: I will die for her. No tricks, no games. I will take her place
honourably, like a Klingon. <br>
KORTAR: If you choose this path, your friends will not be able to save
you. <br>
MIRAL: No! I forbid it! <br>
TORRES: I understand. <br>(The brand vanishes from Miral's cheek and appears on Torres'.)<br>
KORTAR: Your dishonour has been lifted. Sto-Vo-Kor awaits you. <br>
MIRAL: I will not abandon my daughter. <br>
KORTAR: She has made the choice. Go! <br>(Miral vanishes. The Barge arrives at the gates of a fortress.)<br>KORTAR: Daughter of Miral, embrace your
fate.<br>(Torres steps onto the gangplank, and the gates open to reveal a world of flame inside.) </font></p>

Welcome to Gre'thor. <br>
TORRES: This isn't Gre'thor. <br>
EMH: Oh, I assure you it is. You've taken your mark. <br>
TORRES: What is this, some kind of a joke? <br>
NEELIX: This is no laughing matter. <br>
EMH: You've met Mister Neelix, our ambassador to the recently deceased.
Questions, comments, suggestions, he's your man. <br>
NEELIX: If you'll follow me. <br>
EMH: By the way, I'll be performing an aria from Berlioz's Faust
tomorrow night in Holodeck two. Feel free to stop by.

NEELIX: Don't need them. <br>
TORRES: I don't consider Voyager hell. <br>
NEELIX: Are you sure? Have you ever been truly happy here? If you
thought fifty years aboard this ship would be difficult, try eternity.

tribute to her dishonour.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
B'Elanna's misdeeds have led her to Gre'thor. She comes with no valour,
no glory, nothing to celebrate in song and story. <br>
NEELIX: You really have no one to blame but yourself. <br>
KIM: You've kept us all at arm's length. Even Tom, who you claim to
love. <br>
PARIS: Hear, hear. <br>
SEVEN: I tried to assist you in making Engineering more efficient, but
you resisted. You're stubborn. <br>
EMH: She inherited that from her mother, along with the forehead. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What do you think of the afterlife so far? <br>
TORRES: It's not exactly what I had in mind. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Are you interpreting all the symbols? Searching your
subconscious for their meaning? <br>

TORRES: I don't understand. <br>
MIRAL: You never did. <br>
TORRES: I did everything that the ritual told me to do. I came back for
you. <br>
MIRAL: Forget the ritual. It's meaningless. <br>
TORRES: Meaningless? I died for you. <br>
MIRAL: No, you didn't. It's not your time. You still don't understand
this journey. <br>
TORRES: Then tell me. <br>
