JACK: (fast talking man) No. No. It's not fair. Am I alone here? Is
that it? Am I the only one who sees. And what is that incessant noise? <br>
LOEWS: Calm down. <br>
JACK: Why? Am I talking too fast, Doctor? Having trouble keeping up? <br>
LOEWS: I just don't want you to get upset. <br>
PATRICK: (round middle-aged man) Please don't leave us here, Karen.
Please. <br>
LOEWS: It's only for a few weeks, Patrick. <br>
JACK: You know why they brought us here, don't you? Why they carted us
halfway across the quadrant? They're going to experiment on us. <br>
LOEWS: Stop it, Jack. <br>
JACK: They want to find out what makes our genetically engineered
brains tick. They're going to cut our heads open and see what comes
out! <br>
(Patrick cries.) <br>
LOEWS: He's just trying to scare you. Don't listen to him. I told you
why I brought you here, remember? To meet that doctor, Doctor Bashir? <br>
LAUREN: (sultry siren lounging on a couch) You know, the handsome one. <br>
LOEWS: He was genetically enhanced when he was a boy, just like all of
you. <br>
JACK: No, no. He's not like us. I never saw him at the Institute. He
wasn't locked away for being too smart. He's passed himself off as
normal. He's Mister Normal Starfleet man. Mister Productive Member of
Society. Well, maybe we can learn to be just like him. Wear little
uniforms. Yes, sir. No, sir. Thank you, sir. <br>
PATRICK: I don't like it here. <br>
LOEWS: It's going to be all right. Doctor Bashir is going to work with
you for a while, that's all. Just think of it as a little vacation from
the Institute. <br>
JACK: No. No. This isn't happening. <br>
LOEWS: It is happening, Jack, and you're going to have to try to make
the best of it. <br>
LAUREN: I'm going to make the best of it. See the way he's looking at
me? (Bashir's bio on a PADD) He's in love with me already. <br>
JACK: Give me that! <br>
PATRICK: I want to go home. <br>
(Doorbell) <br>
LAUREN: It's him. <br>
(Jack grabs the PADD and jumps on it.) <br>
JACK: See that? That's what I'm going to do to your boyfriend. <br>
LOEWS: Give me the PADD. <br>
(He drags the broken plastic across her hand, cutting it.) <br>
JACK: Sorry. <br>
LOEWS: You're not sorry, we both know that. You did it on purpose
because you're upset. But there are better ways of dealing with being
upset. <br>
JACK: I'll work on it. <br>
LOEWS: All right. Well, I'll see you all in a few weeks. <br>

(A giggle in the darkness.) <br>
JACK: Funny. He doesn't look like a mutant. <br>
BASHIR: Is that you, Jack? <br>
JACK: He knows me. He knows my name. I didn't tell him my name. <br>
BASHIR: It's all right. I just read Doctor Loews's report, that's all. <br>
JACK: I knew that. <br>
BASHIR: Hello, Sarina. <br>
JACK: What is he talking to her for? He read the reports. She won't
answer. Didn't you read the reports? <br>
BASHIR: Would anyone mind if I turned on the lights? <br>
JACK: Would anyone mind if he turned on some lights? Go ahead. We're
not mole people, you know. <br>
BASHIR: Computer, lights. <br>
LAUREN: Hello. <br>
BASHIR: Lauren. <br>
LAUREN: I know what you're thinking, Julian, but I'm not that kind of
girl. <br>
JACK: Bashir, was it? Rings a bell. Bashir, Bashir, Bashir, Bashir. Ah
ha, got it! Fifteenth century poet Singh el Bashir. Any relation? <br>
BASHIR: Yes, actually. <br>
JACK: His work was totally derivative. He was a plagiarist. You knew
that. You had to know. Yet you came in here bragging about it anyway.
Why? <br>
BASHIR: You're the one who brought it up. <br>
(Giggling off screen.) <br>
JACK: What was I supposed to do, just let you get away with it? That
noise! <br>
LAUREN: Tell me, Doctor, what kind of enhancements did your parents
have done to you? <br>
BASHIR: Mental abilities, mostly. But they had my hand eye
coordination, reflexes and vision improved as well. <br>
(Jack does a back flip) <br>
JACK: Can you do that? <br>
BASHIR: I doubt it. <br>
JACK: What happened? Your parents couldn't afford the full overhaul? <br>
LAUREN: He turned out all right. <br>
JACK: You're not exactly known for being very discriminating. <br>
LAUREN: I turned you down, didn't I? <br>
JACK: And you're still regretting it. The cube root of three hundred
twenty nine. What is it? <br>
BASHIR: Six point nine zero three. <br>
LAUREN: Very good. And you didn't even use your fingers. He's a mutant,
just like the rest of us. <br>
JACK: No, no, no. He is not like us. No. He passed as normal. <br>
PATRICK: Is that true? Did you passed as normal? Is that true? <br>
BASHIR: My genetic status was discovered a year ago. <br>
LAUREN: How'd you manage to hide it for so long? <br>
BASHIR: I did my best not to exploit my abilities. <br>
JACK: So no one would suspect. Very clever. I'm impressed. That's not
right. There are reasons why DNA resequencing is illegal. There are
reasons why people like us are barred from serving in Starfleet. We
have an advantage. Normal people can't compete. It's not fair. <br>
BASHIR: Maybe you're right. Maybe I should have said something sooner. <br>
JACK: There are rules. Don't talk with your mouth full. Don't open an
airlock when somebody's inside it. And don't lie about your genetic
status. No, no, no. You did, you lied. And then, when you got caught,
you cut a deal with Starfleet. You got yourself off the hook. <br>
PATRICK: If you'd told the truth, you could have lived with us at the
Institute. <br>
JACK: He's right, you know. Then they would have put you away. <br>
BASHIR: They don't put people away for being genetically engineered. <br>
JACK: No, no, no, no they just won't let us do anything that's worth
doing. No, no. They are afraid that people like us are going to take
over. <br>
BASHIR: It happened before. People like us did try and take over. <br>
JACK: Oh, no, no. I knew you were going to do that. I knew you were
going to trot out the Eugenics Wars. <br>
BASHIR: I'm not trotting anything out. All I'm saying is there's a
reason we've been barred from certain professions. But that doesn't
mean we can't be productive members of society. <br>
JACK: Here it comes. The we can still contribute speech. No. No, no,
no, no. I will not forget what was done to me. I will not be part of a
society that put me away for being too smart. No, no. <br>
BASHIR: All right, then. Since then you have all the answers already,
I'll spare you the speech. I'm having dinner with some friends. <br>
JACK: What, you think we don't eat? We eat. We're going to eat right
now. Yum yum. <br>
PATRICK: I'll go set the table. <br>
(Bashir leaves.) <br>
JACK: Don't worry about us, we'll be fine. <br>
LAUREN: Thanks for scaring him off.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(After dinner) <br>
BASHIR: All I kept thinking was, there but for the grace of God go I. <br>
DAX: How do you mean? <br>
BASHIR: My parents managed to find a decent doctor to perform the DNA
resequencing on me. These four weren't so lucky. They all suffered
unintended side effects. By the time they were five or six, their
parents were forced to come forward and admit that they'd broken the
law so that their children could get treatment. <br>
SISKO: Perhaps they waited too long. <br>
BASHIR: There was nothing the doctors at the Institute could do for
them. These cases are so rare there's no standard treatment. <br>
KIRA: I can't imagine it was a very stimulating environment for them. <br>
BASHIR: That's what Doctor Loews thought when she first came to the
Institute. She got permission to separate them from the other residents
so that she could work with them. <br>
ODO: Why did she bring them here? <br>
BASHIR: She thought they might respond to meeting someone like them,
who was living a normal life. She was also hoping that one day they
might be able to live on their own and be productive. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, let's hope they don't become too productive. Might make
the rest of us look bad. <br>
WORF: It is not a laughing matter. If people like them are allowed to
compete freely, then parents would feel pressured to have their
children enhanced so that they could keep up. <br>
ODO: That's precisely what prompted the ban on DNA resequencing in the
first place. <br>
BASHIR: Giving them a chance to contribute doesn't necessarily mean
sanctioning what was done to them. They didn't ask to have their DNA
tampered with. They were only children. And why should they be excluded
just because their parents broke the law? <br>
SISKO: You're right. It's not quite fair. But even so, it seemed like a
good way to discourage genetic tampering. <br>
O'BRIEN: Besides, it's not as if we're trying to exclude them from
anything. We're just talking about limiting what they're allowed to do.
<br>
BASHIR: Like joining Starfleet. <br>
WORF: Exactly. <br>
BASHIR: Are you saying that I shouldn't be allowed to wear this
uniform? <br>
WORF: Well, you are an exception. <br>
BASHIR: An exception. I should be used to that, I've been one all my
life. First because of the DNA resequencing, and now because I've been
allowed to join Starfleet. <br>
WORF: Perhaps I should not have said anything. <br>
BASHIR: No, it's all right. <br>
SISKO: Well, does anyone care to speculate about what Gul Damar is
going to say in his speech? <br>
O'BRIEN: Nothing we're going to like, I'll bet. <br>
KIRA: It should be starting any minute. <br>
DAX: If he's going to announce another new battle offensive, it's going
to spoil dessert. <br>
JACK [OC]: Can you hear me? Hello? Calling Doctor Bashir. <br>

there was nothing wrong. <br>

You are a mutant. You are. (grabs Sarina) Now, do something about that
noise or I will snap her neck. <br>
(After the break.) <br>

JACK: Maybe I'll wait till he gets here. <br>
BASHIR: If you don't let her go, I'll tell the Chief the noise went
away by itself. <br>
JACK: You think I want to be doing this? I'm just making sure things
get done. <br>

that noise? I know you can't hear it, but it's there. Probably a
sympathetic vibration in a power coupling or something. <br>

don't you fix it before I go mad. <br>

JACK: Finally. <br>
BASHIR: Much better. Thank you, Chief. <br>
DAMAR [on viewscreen]: Fellow citizens, these are great days for
Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies
cause to fear us once more. <br>
(His speech continues under the dialogue.) <br>
O'BRIEN: Can't argue with that. <br>
LAUREN: Who's he? <br>
BASHIR: It's Damar, the new head of the Cardassian government. <br>
DAMAR [on viewscreen]: The war with the Federation accomplished of our
goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe
behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. <br>
JACK: Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown. <br>
PATRICK: He's sad. <br>
LAUREN: Ashamed is more like it. <br>
BASHIR: Why do you say that? <br>
O'BRIEN: Shh. <br>
DAMAR [on viewscreen]: From this position of strength, we are poised to
take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. <br>
LAUREN: Looks like a man who doesn't sleep. <br>
DAMAR: It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It
is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid.
The sons of Cardassia shed <br>

more</a>! Damar does murder sleep! <br>
PATRICK: He's killed someone. <br>
LAUREN: Someone close to him. <br>
O'BRIEN: How could they know that? <br>
DAMAR [on viewscreen: Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice
must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and
preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the
Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet
with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to
hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my
power <br>
JACK: Pretender! You don't belong on that throne and you know it. <br>
DAMAR [on viewscreen]: To protect Cardassia and allow us to <br>
PATRICK: Someone's making him say all this. He doesn't want to. <br>
DAMAR [on viewscreen]: Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my
life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. <br>
(Transmission ends.) <br>
BASHIR: Did any of you know who Damar was before today? <br>
JACK: No, no, no, but it's obvious who he is. The Pretender who killed
the king and seized the throne. <br>
LAUREN: Not the king. He's still alive. <br>
PATRICK: The queen, maybe, or a princess. <br>
BASHIR: Yes, Ziyal. That's Gul Dukat's daughter. <br>
JACK: And now the Pretender finds himself in league with a, a Dark
Knight that he can't control. <br>
O'BRIEN: Weyoun? <br>
JACK: It's not a bad story. Epic, really. What else can you tell us?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Ops]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BASHIR: It was amazing. They pieced together the
entire story of how Damar came to power. Weyoun is the Dark Prince, Gul
Dukat is the deposed King, Damar is the Pretender to the throne, and
Ziyal is the innocent Princess he murdered. And now the Pretender is
wracked with guilt over what he's done. <br>
KIRA: And they got all this just from watching Damar's speech? <br>
BASHIR: Well, they were fascinated by the whole thing. They kept
bombarding me with questions about Cardassia and the war. I've never
seen them so engaged. <br>
DAX: And you want to keep them engaged. <br>
BASHIR: I'd like to try. I'm just running out of material. <br>
KIRA: What do you mean? <br>
BASHIR: They've already gone through everything the computer has on
Cardassia and the Dominion. <br>
(Sisko comes out of his office.) <br>
SISKO: Roll out the red carpet. <br>
DAX: Visitors? <br>
SISKO: Starfleet has decided to listen to what Damar has to say. He and
Weyoun will be arriving in the morning. I am the lucky one who gets the
chance to sit across the table from them. <br>
BASHIR: That's great. <br>
KIRA: It's hard to believe that the Dominion really wants peace. I
wouldn't be surprised if they were just stalling for time in order to
regroup. <br>
BASHIR: Sir, is there any chance I can get a transcript of the
negotiations? <br>
SISKO: You can do better than that. The Dominion has insisted on
recording the proceedings so that everyone can see that their desire
for peace is sincere. <br>
BASHIR: Perfect. <br>
DAX: You shouldn't have agreed to that, Benjamin. Now you'll have to be
on your best behaviour.

BASHIR: End programme. <br>
(The meeting room disappears.) <br>
BASHIR: All right, they want the Kabrel system. But why? <br>
LAUREN: I don't know, but they're willing to give up a lot to get it.
The mizinite deposits on Holna Four alone are enough to keep their
shipyards running for years. <br>
JACK: Yes, yes, yes. That's a typical Dominion strategy. They offer to
give up something valuable in order to hide the fact that they want
something even more valuable in the long term. See, that's how they
think. Big picture. They don't worry about what's going to happen
tomorrow, no, no, no, they're thinking long term. They're thinking
what's going to happen a year from now, a decade, a century. Yes, yes. <br>
BASHIR: There must be something special about the Kabrel system. <br>
LAUREN: Nothing on the first planet but some simple protozoids and
trinucleic fungi. The second planet has some cormaline deposits, but
they're common enough. <br>
JACK: Okay, okay, okay. Maybe there's another reason. Does it have any
strategic value? <br>
(Bashir notices Sarina writing on a PADD.) <br>
LAUREN: Not that I can see. They wouldn't want to build a base there. <br>
JACK: Why not? Why not? Seems perfectly suitable. <br>

lot of ionic interference. <br>
(Bashir reads Sarina's PADD) <br>
JACK: All right, forget that. <br>
BASHIR: Does this have anything to do with what we're talking about,
Sarina? Can we take it? <br>
JACK: Think, think. Any evidence that Kabrel used to support an
advanced civilisation? Maybe they're looking to excavate something
valuable like an ancient technology. <br>

structure.) <br>
SISKO: Chemistry was never my strong suit. What is it? <br>
BASHIR: It shows how you can break down tri-nucleic fungus to make
yridium bicantizine, one of the active ingredients in Ketracel White.
That's why the Dominion wants the Kabrel system, so that they can
manufacture the drug right here in the Alpha Quadrant. According to our
calculations, they'll be able to make enough White to supply the
Jem'Hadar indefinitely. <br>
SISKO: I was going to recommend that the Federation accept the proposed
border. It could have cost us the Alpha Quadrant. <br>
BASHIR: Actually, sir, we should give them Kabrel. <br>
SISKO: Why is that? <br>
BASHIR: If we don't, the Dominion will be forced to attack before their
stockpile of White runs out. Here are the casualty projections. As you
can see, an attack would result in devastating casualties for both
sides. <br>
SISKO: You're suggesting we stall? <br>
BASHIR: It'll buy us time to rebuild our defences and bring the
Romulans into the alliance. <br>
SISKO: The Romulans? <br>
BASHIR: According to our analyses, there it is, they'll vote to abandon
their non-aggression pact with the Dominion at next year's plenary
session. By which time, internal pressures between the Cardassians and

days ago you said these people were impossible to deal with, now
they're turning out projections that it would take Starfleet
Intelligence months to come up with. <br>
BASHIR: We're mutants. I know, we're not exactly qualified for this
kind of work and it could be said that it is beyond the limits of what
people like us should be allowed to do. But I think if you allow me to
walk you through our analyses, you'll be impressed. <br>
SISKO: All right, Doctor. Go ahead. <br>
BASHIR: Thank you, sir. The way our statistical analysis works, the
farther into the future you go, the more accurate the projection. It's
based on a kind of non-linear dynamics, whereby small fluctuations tend
to factor out over time. The net result is <br>
SISKO: Just a minute, Doctor. Why don't we go back to the beginning and
take me through this step by step, nice and easy. <br>

BASHIR: Sir, I understand how you feel. I don't like it any more than
you do, but it's the best option. We've run dozens of different
scenarios. Even if something unlikely were to happen tilting the scales
in our favour, such as an anti-Dominion coup on Cardassia, we'll still
lose this war. <br>
SISKO: But that doesn't mean we should just give up and roll over. <br>
BASHIR: If we fight, there will be over nine hundred billion
casualties. If we surrender, no one dies. Either way we're in for five
generations of Dominion rule. Eventually a rebellion will form,
centring on Earth. It'll spread, and within another generation, they'll
succeed in conquering the Dominion. The Alpha Quadrant will unite and a
new, stronger Federation will rule for thousands of years. Since we
can't win this war, why don't we save as many lives as we can? I know
it's difficult to accept. <br>
SISKO: I don't accept it. Your entire argument is based on a series of
statistical probabilities and assumptions. <br>
BASHIR: They're not just assumptions. If you want me to take you
through the equations, I will. <br>
SISKO: Even if I knew with a hundred percent certainty what was going
to happen, I wouldn't ask an entire generation of people to voluntarily
give up their freedom. <br>
BASHIR: Not even to save over nine hundred billion lives? <br>
SISKO: Surrender is not an option. Now I'm happy to hear your group's
advice on how to win this war, but I don't need your advice on how to
lose it. <br>
BASHIR: We can't win this war. <br>
SISKO: I don't care if the odds are against us. If we're going to lose,
then we're going to go down fighting so that when our descendents some
day rise up against the Dominion someday, they'll know what they're
made of. <br>
BASHIR: With all due respect, sir, aren't you letting your pride get in
your way? <br>
SISKO: All right, Doctor. You've made your recommendation. I'll pass it
on to Starfleet Command. <br>

but it's quite another for us to take it on ourselves to trigger an

to decide who lives and who dies. We're not gods. <br>
