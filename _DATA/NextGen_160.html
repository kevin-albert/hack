has put in at Rutia Four to deliver medical supplies following an
outbreak of violent protests. Although non-aligned, the planet has
enjoyed a long trading relationship with the Federation. Now, a
generation of peace has ended with terrorist attacks by Ansata
separatists, who are demanding autonomy and self-determination for
their homeland on the western continent. Recreational shore leave has
been prohibited and all away teams have been beam down armed. </font></p>

Wes. <br>
PICARD: You see, the Ansata separatists have been trying for
generations to freed themselves from the rule of the eastern continent.
If they can get the government just to acknowledge their demands, then
kidnapping your mother will have served its purpose. I think that may
be what they're after, but it may not. Frankly, Wesley, I don't care.
My only concern is to get your mother back. Very shortly, we shall be

kill without remorse or conscience. Who think nothing of murdering
innocent people. <br>
PICARD: But they could just as easily have shot her where she stood. <br>
ALEXANA: Don't ask me to explain them. I can't. The atrocities that
I've seen. And now they have this new device that makes them even more
deadly. How do I combat an enemy who fails to register on any scanner
until they're literally standing in front of you, pointing a phaser at
your head? <br>

ALEXANA: Not much, really. They first started using it two months ago.
We've taken several of these off dead terrorists.

study it? <br>

to the Ansata? <br>
ALEXANA: No, not really. We suspect the organisation itself only to
consist of some two hundred members. There are over five thousand names
on this list, citizens we know to be sympathetic to their cause. They
pass along weaponry and information, march in pro-Ansata
demonstrations, participate in general strikes or the occasional riot. <br>
RIKER: How did this ever get started? <br>
ALEXANA: Seventy years ago we denied them independence. That gave them
a noble cause. Now it's just an excuse for more violence. <br>
RIKER: You hate them as much as they hate you. <br>
ALEXANA: Believe it or not, I always considered myself moderate. <br>

grow. The three assassination attempts on my life. <br>
RIKER: Well, that'll change your point of view. <br>
ALEXANA: The event that really opened my eyes took place only a few
days after my arrival. A terrorist bomb destroyed a shuttlebus. Sixty
schoolchildren. There were no survivors. The Ansata claimed that it was
a mistake, that their intended target was a police transport. As if
that made everything all right. That day I vowed that I would put an
end to terrorism in this city. And I will.

DATA: Are you referring to the Elway Theorem? <br>
WESLEY: Yes. Computer, call up the files on the Elway Theorem. What if
they're using inter-dimensional travel? <br>
DATA: But the Elway Theorem proved to be entirely inaccurate. All
research was abandoned by the mid-twenty third century. <br>
WESLEY: But Data, look, the nuclear vibrations are the same, and Elway
used a model similar to this. <br>
LAFORGE: It would certainly be untraceable by any standard method of
detection. <br>
DATA: But it was proven to be fatal. To use this technology would be an
irrational act. <br>

FINN: They have joined forces with the Rutians against us. <br>
CRUSHER: We are not your enemy. <br>
FINN: They are more valuable to me than an enemy. For seventy years we
have shouted, and no one's heard us. Destroy the Federation flagship,
someone will listen. <br>
CRUSHER: Please. <br>
FINN: They are the ones who interfered. They are the ones who sent
medical supplies. They are the ones who organised mass arrests. They
are killing your son, not me. <br>
CRUSHER: Please, Finn, don't do this. I will do anything you ask. <br>
FINN: I had a son, too. He was thirteen when he died in detention.

or dead. And there were other casualties. <br>
CRUSHER: Was Wes on the Bridge? <br>
PICARD: Yes. He took cover. I didn't see any more than that. But you
all right though? <br>
CRUSHER: Yes, they needed a doctor. <br>
PICARD: The side effects of the transport? <br>
CRUSHER: Yes. <br>
PICARD: We're getting closer to tracing their movements. Actually, it
was Wesley who put us onto this dimensional jump of theirs. He has been
extraordinary, Beverly. He's going to make a very fine officer. <br>
CRUSHER: He's had good role models. I'm sorry. If I'd only gone back to
the ship. <br>
PICARD: I should have beamed you up. <br>
CRUSHER: You wouldn't dare. <br>
PICARD: Oh yes I would, and should. <br>
CRUSHER: Without my permission? <br>
PICARD: If you don't follow orders. <br>
CRUSHER: If you'd give reasonable orders, I'd obey. <br>
PICARD: Doctor, I will be the judge of reasonable. <br>
CRUSHER: There aren't any exits to the surface. <br>
PICARD: So the only way out is by the transporter. Or the dimensional
jump. <br>
CRUSHER: A mode of travel I'd encourage you to avoid. It's killing
them. <br>
PICARD: They're mad. <br>
CRUSHER: I don't know any more. The difference between a madman and a
committed man willing to die for a cause. It's all become blurred over
the last few days. <br>
PICARD: Beverly, I don't have to remind you of the psychological impact
of being a hostage. <br>
CRUSHER: I know. I understand that. But their leader, Finn, he's not
what you'd expect. <br>
PICARD: No, he's certainly not what I would expect. Without cause or
reason, he and his little band of outlaws has attacked my ship!<br>
CRUSHER: But he did have reasons. The medical supplies, the arrests.
Jean-Luc, if we really examined our role in all this <br>
PICARD: Beverly, you are arguing for a man who may have murdered your
son. <br>
FINN: I didn't kill your son, Beverly. We weren't able to destroy the
ship. We had to settle for him. She wouldn't even tell me her name. I
call her Doctor. <br>
PICARD: You have made a grave miscalculation. <br>
FINN: Oh? <br>
PICARD: You have assaulted a Federation starship, killed and wounded
several members of her crew, kidnapped two of her officers, and you
don't expect a response? <br>
FINN: On the contrary, I'm counting on it. <br>
PICARD: You want Federation involvement? <br>
FINN: Captain, the Federation has a lot to admire in it, but there's a
hint of moral cowardice in your dealings with non-aligned planets.
You're doing business with a government that is crushing us and you say
you're not involved. You're very, very much involved. You just don't
want to get dirty. <br>
PICARD: You accuse us of cowardice while you plant bombs in shadows? <br>
FINN: I am been fighting the only war that I can against an intractable
enemy. Now, I'm fighting a big war against a more powerful adversary.
Can't you see how that helps me? <br>
CRUSHER: I'm afraid I can't. <br>
PICARD: He's added another chair to the negotiating table. <br>
FINN: You added the chair, Captain. I am simply forcing you to sit in
it. The Federation will quickly tire of our little war. They'll want
you back. They will want to get as far away from Rutia as they can. And
I will not make it easy. Eventually, the Federation will force the
government into make concessions. And then a few more, and then a few
more. Until we can finally reach an honourable agreement that saves
face for all sides. Except we win. <br>
PICARD: You understand I will not cooperate with you in any way. <br>
FINN: You've already cooperated, Captain, just by coming here.

FINN: I am not here to hurt you. Just hear what I have to say. Your
people are safe. How long they stay that way depends on you. We demand
an embargo and trade sanctions levied against Rutia. The Federation
will blockade the planet. No ships will be allowed in or out. This will
continue until the government of Rutia consents to talks mediated by a
Federation council. You have twelve hours to make your decision.

abduct you or play games with your life. He would treat you with
respect. <br>
FINN: I've treated you with respect. <br>

through fear just like you've tried to control this whole continent. <br>

CRUSHER: Is that the best you can do? Is fear the only weapon you have?

that you might win this fight and gain real power. <br>
