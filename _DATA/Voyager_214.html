Wildman is having a pre-natal check-up.) <br>
WILDMAN: I've been considering naming him after my husband. It's been a
tradition in his family for over five generations. <br>
KES: I'm sure he'd be very pleased. <br>
WILDMAN: My husband's name is Greskrendtregk. He's Ktarian. <br>
EMH: Choosing a name is no easy matter. I speak from experience. <br>
WILDMAN: Have you had any progress, Doctor? <br>
EMH: I've reviewed historical, literary and anthropological databases
from over five hundred worlds and have yet to find a suitable name.
However, I may want to give some thought to Greskrendtregk. <br>
WILDMAN: To be honest, I've been thinking of something simpler. What do
you think of Cameron? <br>
KES: I like it. <br>
EMH: Cameron, from the ancient Celtic term for one whose nose is bent. <br>
WILDMAN: What about Frederick? <br>
EMH: Frederick. Very distinguished. However, it bears a close
resemblance to a rather impolite term on the Bolian homeworld. <br>
WILDMAN: It doesn't have to be a human name. I like Sural. It's Vulcan.
<br>
EMH: Yes, unfortunately it was also the name of a dictator on Sakura
Prime, famed for beheading his rivals, and his parents. <br>
KES: You won't have any objection to Benaren. <br>
EMH: You're right. I've never heard that name before. <br>
WILDMAN: I think it's lovely. Is it Ocampan? <br>
KES: Benaren was my father's name. He was the greatest inspiration of
my life. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: All science officers. Please report to your stations. <br>
EMH: Your scans look fine, Ensign. We'll see you in a week. <br>
WILDMAN: Thank you. Greskrendtregk would make a good middle name, don't
you think? <br>
(Wildman leaves.) <br>
EMH: You never suggested your father's name to me. <br>
KES: I thought you were only considering human names. <br>
EMH: Ah. Well, you were mistaken.<br>
KES: If you like Benaren there's no reason you can't use it too. I'm
sure she won't mind. <br>
EMH: Won't mind that I just usurped her baby's name the moment I heard
it? Thank you, but no thank you. <br>
KES: My uncle's name was Elrem. I once knew a boy named Tarrik. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PARIS:
There's not much left of whatever it was. From the amount of debris I'd
guess it was a small ship, no bigger than a shuttlecraft. <br>
KIM: I'm not reading any organic material in the debris field. It must
have been an unmanned vessel. Possibly a probe. <br>
JANEWAY: Any idea what happened to it? <br>
TUVOK: The high residual energy signature indicates repeated weapons
fire. <br>
KIM: Captain, the wreckage is composed primarily of duritanium
polyalloy. <br>
JANEWAY: Duritanium? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I haven't seen many weapons that could do that kind of damage
to a duritanium hull. <br>
JANEWAY: Transport some samples of the debris to Engineering for
analysis. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Continuous scans, Lieutenant. We don't want whoever did this
to catch us by surprise. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Any conclusions? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Afraid so. <br>
TORRES: We've identified the signature left by the weapons fire.
There's no question. It was Cardassian. <br>
JANEWAY: Cardassian! Could Seska be responsible? <br>
TORRES: No, Captain. I am. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Briefing
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
The probe was destroyed by an experimental Cardassian weapon from the
Alpha quadrant. <br>
(Paris runs in, late.) <br>
PARIS: Sorry. <br>
TORRES: I recognise it's signature because, because I know this weapon
very well. Chakotay and I got our hands on it when we were fighting the
Cardassians. <br>
KIM: How did it get here? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Probably the same way we did. <br>
TORRES: The last time we saw it, it was heading in the same direction
in the Badlands where the Caretaker picked us up. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Originally the Cardassians sent this thing to destroy a
Maquis munitions base. We nicknamed it Dreadnought. It's a self-guided
tactical missile carrying a charge of a thousand kilos of matter and
another thousand of antimatter. <br>
TUVOK: Enough to destroy a small moon. <br>
TORRES: Now add to that one of the most sophisticated computer systems
I've ever seen. They made this missile adaptable, evasive, armed with
it's own defensive weaponry. In other words, unstoppable. <br>
NEELIX: So, how did you stop it? <br>
CHAKOTAY: We didn't. It got through all our defences. Worked like it
was supposed to except for one minor detail. It didn't go off. <br>
TORRES: Leave it to the Cardassians to build such an incredibly
advanced tactical weapon and then arm the warhead with an old kinetic
detonator. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The missile skipped off into the atmosphere and quietly went
into orbit. <br>
TORRES: I got inside it and reprogrammed the computer. Hell, I didn't
just reprogramme it, I changed it's identity. I made it forget about
being Cardassian. Now it was working for the Maquis. <br>
CHAKOTAY: And we gave it a new mission. To destroy the Cardassian fuel
depot on Aschelan Five. But it never made it out of the Badlands. We
thought it had been destroyed in one of the plasma storms. <br>
JANEWAY: So how do we stop this weapon before it causes any more
damage? <br>
TORRES: Dreadnaught masks its warp trail with a randomised EM field,
but I can modify our navigational sensors to cut through that. <br>
PARIS: And what are we going to do with it once we find it? <br>
TORRES: I get back inside it. I know all the security codes. I
installed them myself. <br>
JANEWAY: Lieutenant Paris can assist you with the navigational sensors.
Keep me informed. Dismissed. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Lieutenant. I expect everyone to show up for meetings on time
and properly dressed. <br>
(Paris nearly says something, then changes his mind.) <br>
PARIS: Yes, sir. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PARIS:
There's still a lot of distortion in the upper frequencies. Better. Now
let's try filtering out the ion radiation. B'Elanna? You must be really
worried about catching this thing. <br>
TORRES: Chakotay wasn't telling the whole truth. We didn't send
Dreadnought on a mission against the Cardassians. I was the one who
sent it, without asking him. <br>
PARIS: You were afraid he'd say no. <br>
TORRES: After I did it, he pulled me aside and I was ready to defend
myself. I was so sure that I had anticipated everything that could
possibly go wrong. I even programmed it to warn Federation ships to
stay out of its way, in my own voice. <br>
PARIS: Your voice? <br>
TORRES: Listening to that Cardassian computer's voice was driving me
crazy. <br>
PARIS: I don't blame you. <br>
TORRES: Anyway, Chakotay looked at me. I didn't know him very well yet.
And all he said, in that damned soft voice of his was that I'd hurt
him. That he thought he'd earned my trust and loyalty. I was so glad
when it disappeared into the Badlands. I remember thinking, thank god,
it's over. But it's not. And if anything happens here because of
Dreadnought, it's my fault. No one else's. <br>
PARIS: You took a risk. You were thinking like a Maquis. That was a
whole different life. <br>
TORRES: Tell me about it. <br>
PARIS: You know, I've been surprised at how well you've been able to
fit in here. A little envious too. <br>
TORRES: Tom, what's been going on with you lately? <br>
PARIS: Going on? How? <br>
TORRES: People are starting to talk. <br>
PARIS: Are they? People like who? Chakotay? <br>
TORRES: No, I mean people. Like me. Like today. Look at yourself,
coming to a briefing late. And is it true you had a fight with
Lieutenant Rollins? <br>
PARIS: The Lieutenant was unhappy that my conn. reports weren't
punctuated properly, according to Starfleet protocol. I didn't like his
attitude. <br>
TORRES: Was he right about your reports? <br>
PARIS: We're in the Delta quadrant, nowhere near Starfleet. What
difference? Yeah, he was right. I'm the one who's been wrong. Wrong
about a lot of things. Why don't we try running a multi-phasic sweep? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
Captain, I'm picking up the trail again. New heading one nine six mark
four. <br>
PARIS: I'm on it. <br>
JANEWAY: This course is erratic. Are we sure we're following a single
warp trail? <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps the missile's navigational system is malfunctioning.
It's been operating for over a year, far longer than it was designed to
function. <br>
TORRES: No, this is deliberate. It's following one of the evasive
patterns I programmed into it. It must have observed us following. <br>
KIM: I think I've got it on long range sensors. <br>
TORRES: No, that's only a sensor echo. Dreadnought's programmed to
deflect it's up to one hundred thousand kilometres from it's true
location. The next time you get a heading look for a brief surge in
neutrino emissions within a one hundred thousand kilometre radius.
That'll be the real thing. <br>
KIM: Got it. Elevated neutrino levels. Locking in coordinates. It's
within visual range. <br>
CHAKOTAY: On screen. <br>
TORRES: It's targeting scanners have been activated. <br>
JANEWAY: What's wrong? <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's not supposed to do that until it's locked onto it's
final target. <br>
TORRES: It's heading for a planet in a system over ten light years
away. At its current speed, it'll get there in about three weeks. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The planet is Class M. I'm reading several heavily populated
areas. </font></p>

Seska will want to know about this Cardassian missile immediately. <br>
LORRUM [on monitor]: Mister Jonas, your enthusiasm is appreciated, but
I would prefer to know more about it before I bring it to Maje Culluh's
attention. <br>
JONAS: If I could just talk to Seska. <br>
LORRUM [on monitor]: As I explained, I have now been assigned to be

JONAS: Look, has she been made aware how much I've been helping you? <br>
LORRUM [on monitor]: What the Maje chooses to share with her is none of
my concern, but you are in good hands, my friend. Now tell me more
about this weapon your ship has found. <br>
JONAS: Look, all you need to tell Seska is that this missile is better
armed than the entire Kazon-Nistrim sect. <br>

JANEWAY: My name is Kathryn Janeway, Captain of the Federation Starship
Voyager. <br>
KELLAN [on viewscreen]: First Minister Kellan, Captain. What is it you
want. <br>
JANEWAY: Our scans of your world suggest you have long range tracking
abilities. <br>
KELLAN [on viewscreen]: We have been observing your course for the last
two days. <br>
JANEWAY: Have you also been able to detect the missile on a parallel
course off our starboard bow? <br>
KELLAN [on viewscreen]: We haven't been able to identify what it is,
but yes. <br>
JANEWAY: You have the right to know, First Minister, that this missile
is carrying a warhead with a significant destructive force that <br>
KELLAN [on viewscreen]: Is this some sort of threat, Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: On the contrary. We want to help. <br>
KELLAN [on viewscreen]: I find that hard to believe. Your reputation
precedes you, Captain. We've been told that you've threatened many
races since your arrival in this quadrant. <br>
JANEWAY: First Minister, we're aware the Kazon have been telling that
to people. They'd like to prevent us from making allies. But I assure
you, you've been misled. <br>
KELLAN [on viewscreen]: And yet here you are, sending this missile
towards us. <br>
JANEWAY: The missile arrived here from our quadrant due to a very
unusual accident. We haven't been able to determine yet why it chose
Rakosa as it's target, but my Chief Engineer is preparing to disarm it
before it reaches you. <br>
KELLAN [on viewscreen]: Perhaps you are telling me this in order to
delay our defensive response. <br>
JANEWAY: I could have maintained communication silence and not given
you any warning at all. <br>
KELLAN [on viewscreen]: That's true. Nevertheless, be aware that I am
placing our defence force on alert. <br>

PARIS: Captain, it's maintaining course and speed. <br>
KIM: We're being hailed by the missile. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's hear it. <br>
DREADNOUGHT [OC]: Unidentified Federation ship. Although this vessel is
Cardassian it has been appropriated by the Maquis. Please stand down
your weapons. <br>
JANEWAY: You stand down your weapons and I'll stand down mine. <br>
DREADNOUGHT [OC]: You are interfering with a tactical mission against
Cardassian aggressors. This vessel is programmed to respond with all
necessary force to prevent any disruption to its mission. <br>
TORRES: Dreadnought, why have you resumed course? <br>
DREADNOUGHT [OC]: Hello B'Elanna. Course was resumed once your safe
departure from this vessel was confirmed. It was a necessary response
to your deception. <br>
TORRES: My deception? <br>
DREADNOUGHT [OC]: You are participating in the Delta quadrant
deception. <br>
JANEWAY: Explain, Dreadnought. <br>
DREADNOUGHT [OC]: False information has been entered into Dreadnought's
navigational sensor array. <br>
PARIS: When a bomb starts talking about itself in the third person, I
get worried. <br>
TORRES: Why would I enter false information? <br>
DREADNOUGHT [OC]: Probability assessment indicates you are being
coerced by Cardassian forces. <br>
JANEWAY: You've already identified Voyager as a Federation ship,
Dreadnought. Your scanners must indicate this is not a Cardassian crew.
<br>
DREADNOUGHT [OC]: Probability assessment indicates you are operating
within the parameters of the Cardassian Federation Alliance, as
described in the treaty of 2367. A treaty rejected by the Maquis. <br>
TORRES: So when I was just over there and you shut yourself off, you
were lying to me? <br>
DREADNOUGHT [OC]: Acknowledged. <br>
TORRES: I never taught it to do that. <br>
DREADNOUGHT [OC]: That is not correct, B'Elanna. Your tactical
subroutine instructed Dreadnought to prepare responses for thirty nine
potential Cardassian threats. The possibility of your capture and
coercion was number seven. <br>
JANEWAY: Dreadnought, is there anyway we can prove to you you are
actually in the Delta quadrant. That this is not a deception. <br>
DREADNOUGHT [OC]: The probability of being in the Delta quadrant,
seventy five thousand light years from last confirmed location, is
negligible. The target is located in the Alpha quadrant. Target lock
has been established. There will be no further warnings. Terminating
communications link. <br>
TORRES: The one possible vulnerability I remember is in the thoron
shock emitter. If we can get it to fire at full power, that should
destabilise the reactor core for thirty seconds. A single sustained
tachyon beam might just penetrate that core and destroy it. <br>
JANEWAY: What will it take to provoke Dreadnought into firing? <br>
TORRES: It shouldn't be that difficult. Once we go after it with an
all-out assault, the emitter should fire. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok, set your target. Ready photons. <br>
TUVOK: Ready Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Fire. <br>
(Four photon torpedoes are used.) <br>
TUVOK: The missile's thoron shock emitter has fired. <br>
(Boom.) <br>
JANEWAY: Initiate the tachyon beam. <br>
TUVOK: We have penetrated its shields. Direct hit to the core. <br>
KIM: Reading an energy build up in it's reactor. It should overload in
about thirty seconds. Wait a minute. There's a plasma surge coming from
it's core. What the hell? <br>
(Whumph!) <br>
JANEWAY: Report! <br>
KIM: It sent a plasma burst along the tachyon beam into our main power
system. We've got EPS relays burnt out all over the ship. <br>
PARIS: I'm not getting any response from the warp or impulse drives.
Even the manoeuvring thrusters are out. <br>

that yourself. <br>
KELLAN [on monitor]: And what would you have me do? Sit here and wait

through the tool she is using. She throws it away and gets out a

TORRES: I'm disappointed in you, Dreadnought. If I really was a

tried to disable. <br>

TORRES: I'm reluctant to discuss them in present company, but could you
send over a. Captain? <br>
DREADNOUGHT: Communications have been terminated. Transporter lock has
also been disengaged. <br>
TORRES: What took you so long? <br>
DREADNOUGHT: There was a tactical advantage in monitoring your ship's
communications until this time. <br>
TORRES: So, it's just you and me now. <br>
DREADNOUGHT: You are accessing the detonation control circuit.
Probability assessment indicates you are attempting to detonate the
explosive before it reaches its target. <br>
TORRES: Now, that wouldn't make much sense, would it? I'd be killing
myself in the process. <br>
DREADNOUGHT: Probability assessment indicates you are attempting to
detonate the explosive before it reaches its target. <br>
TORRES: If I'm being coerced by Cardassians, why would I be willing to
sacrifice myself for them? Answer that one. <br>
DREADNOUGHT: Unable to respond. Reassessing probabilities. <br>
TORRES: Ah, ha. Gotcha. Why don't we reassess those probabilities
together, okay? Remember how we used to play hypothetical games? <br>
DREADNOUGHT: Affirmative. <br>
TORRES: Let's play one now. Here's a hypothetical situation for you.
Suppose I've been telling you the truth all along, and you really are
in the Delta quadrant. <br>
DREADNOUGHT: Probability of being in the Delta quadrant, seventy five
thousand light years from last confirmed location, is negligible. <br>
TORRES: Hypothetical, Dreadnought. It's a game, remember? Assume it's
true for a moment. <br>
DREADNOUGHT: Assumption entered. <br>
TORRES: And we're heading for the wrong target. <br>
DREADNOUGHT: Assumption entered. <br>
TORRES: Millions of innocent people about to die when you detonate. <br>
DREADNOUGHT: Assumption entered. <br>
TORRES: Now, explain to me how this might happen. <br>
DREADNOUGHT: If key sensor programmes were damaged or deleted,
databanks would be compromised. <br>
TORRES: Just for the fun of it, let's have a look at those databanks.
See if anything looks at all compromised. <br>
(A display comes up on a wall monitor.) <br>
TORRES: Is this a complete file directory? There seem to be a few
missing. <br>
DREADNOUGHT: Files containing information about the weapons or tactical
systems are not necessary to verify sensor accuracy. <br>
TORRES: Oh, I'm hurt you don't trust me. Hold on, pause the display.
What's that? Computer, identify the Cardassian file on screen. <br>
DREADNOUGHT: Unable to identify. <br>
TORRES: Looks like a back-up file. Computer, when was this file
created? <br>
DREADNOUGHT: Stardate 46437.5 <br>
TORRES: I believe that was before you and I ever met. <br>
DREADNOUGHT: Hypothetical game terminated. Probability reassessment
complete. <br>
TORRES: A new conclusion? <br>
DREADNOUGHT: Affirmative. Probability of being in the Delta quadrant
remains negligible. When that option is rejected, new probability
assessment indicates that you have changed loyalties, B'Elanna. You are
now cooperating with the Cardassian Federation Alliance as described in
the treaty of 2367, a treaty which has been rejected by the Maquis. <br>
TORRES: Dreadnought. <br>
DREADNOUGHT: Humanoid life support aboard this vessel has been
terminated. Approaching target at full impulse. Stage one alert has
been activated. Initiating final detonation sequence. </font></p>
