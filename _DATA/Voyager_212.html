Warp five. Warp six. Warp seven. I've reached critical velocity. <br>

Transwarp online. Warp nine point two, nine point three. My vector's

fracture in the port nacelle pylon. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TORRES:
It's the pylon again. Every time we get close to crossing the
threshold, the subspace torque rips a nacelle off the shuttle. <br>
KIM: What about a duranium alloy? We could try using it to reinforce <br>
TORRES: No, I've thought about that already. It's too brittle. <br>
NEELIX: More coffee? Ah, you look like a happy bunch. <br>
KIM: We've hit a wall. <br>
NEELIX: Oh. Well, maybe I can help. <br>
PARIS: Great. Do you know anything about quantum warp theory or
multi-spectral subspace engine design? <br>
NEELIX: No. But I'm a quick study. What are we working on? <br>
(Neelix sits and looks at the array of PADDS.) <br>
TORRES: Do you have anything to eat? <br>
NEELIX: Sure. There's some Kalavian biscuits, somewhere in the kitchen.
<br>
TORRES: I guess I'll go find them myself. Fill him in. <br>
KIM: Neelix, it would take too long to <br>
NEELIX: What are you saying? I'm not smart enough? I'll have you know I
did two years as an engineer's assistant aboard a Trabalian freighter.
I'm well-versed in warp theory. <br>
PARIS: Okay, okay. We'll tell you. We're trying to break the maximum
warp barrier. <br>
KIM: Nothing in the universe can go warp ten. It's a theoretical
impossibility. In principle, if you were ever to reach warp ten, you'd
be travelling at infinite velocity. <br>
NEELIX: Infinite velocity. Got it. So that means very fast. <br>
PARIS: It means that you would occupy every point in the universe
simultaneously. In theory, you could go any place in the wink of an
eye. Time and distance would have no meaning. <br>
(See Douglas Adams for further details.) <br>
KIM: If Voyager achieved warp ten, we could be home in as long as it
takes to push a button. <br>
NEELIX: Wow! And you're working on this? <br>
PARIS: We discovered a new form of dilithium in the asteroid field we
surveyed last month. It remains stable at a much higher warp frequency.
<br>
KIM: The problem is, every time we simulate crossing the transwarp
threshold, the nacelles get torn off the ship. <br>
NEELIX: I remember there was a time when I lost a warp nacelle going
through a dark matter nebula. <br>
PARIS: This is a very different problem. <br>
NEELIX: I realise that. I'm just using it as an example. As the ship
went through the nebula, it sent out a dark matter bow wave. Eventually
so much pressure built up, it tore the nacelle from its housing. Now,
maybe the same thing is happening to you. <br>
KIM: No, the simulations don't indicate any kind of subspace stress on
the nacelles. <br>
PARIS: Wait a minute. What about the shuttle itself? <br>
KIM: What do you mean? <br>
PARIS: Maybe we've been looking in the wrong place. What if the
nacelles aren't being torn from the ship? What if the ship is being
torn from the nacelles? <br>
KIM: The hull of the shuttle is made of tritanium alloy. At the speeds
we're talking about, that alloy could depolarise. <br>
PARIS: And create a velocity differential. The fuselage would be
travelling at a faster rate of speed than the nacelles. <br>
KIM: That means we just have to set up a depolarisation matrix around
the fuselage. <br>
PARIS: That's it! Neelix, you're a genius. <br>
(Paris and Kim leave.) <br>
NEELIX: I have no idea what they just said. <br>
(Neelix takes a biscuit from the plate that Torres found in the
kitchen.)

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS
[on monitor]: Warp nine point nine two. The pylons are secure.
Everything looks good. Nine point nine seven, eight, nine. Warp ten! <br>
TORRES [OC]: You've crossed the threshold. You've done it. And there's
been no damage to the nacelles. <br>
JANEWAY: When you came to me a month ago and said you had a way to
cross the transwarp threshold, I thought it was more of a fantasy than
a theory. Congratulations to all of you. <br>
TORRES: So we can try a manned test flight? <br>
JANEWAY: What's your flight plan? <br>
PARIS: I'll bring the shuttle up to speed. The second I cross the
threshold, I'll cut the engines, drop out of warp and come about. <br>
KIM: After that, we'll analyse the shuttle's sensor logs. Once we know
it's safe to travel at transwarp, we'll try a more extended flight. <br>
CHAKOTAY: To be honest, it's almost frightening. Up till now, it's all
been theory. I never thought it would actually happen. Are we ready for
it? <br>
JANEWAY: In the last couple of centuries, we've always managed to use
new technologies wisely. I'm confident this time won't be any
different. Besides, there's no way to put the genie back in the bottle.
All we can do now is keep moving forward, carefully. Well, good luck,
Mister Paris. If this works, you'll be joining an elite group of
pilots. Orville Wright, Neil Armstrong, Zefram Cochrane and Tom Paris. <br>
PARIS: I kind of like the way that sounds. <br>
JANEWAY: I thought you might.

JANEWAY: At ease, Mister Paris. I know it's late. <br>
PARIS: Can I get you anything? <br>
JANEWAY: No, thank you. <br>
PARIS: Now, why do I get the feeling this isn't just a social call? <br>
JANEWAY: I've just spoken to the Doctor, and it's his opinion that we
let Ensign Kim make the test flight. <br>
PARIS: May I ask why? <br>
JANEWAY: He checked over your biometric readings from the shuttle
simulations. He says you have a slight enzymatic imbalance in your
cerebellum. <br>
PARIS: So? <br>
JANEWAY: I know it doesn't sound like much, but he can't predict
what'll happen when you cross the threshold. He believes there's a
small chance that you could suffer a brain haemorrhage under the
subspace stress. <br>
PARIS: How big a chance? <br>
JANEWAY: Two percent. <br>
PARIS: Two percent? I'll take that chance. <br>
JANEWAY: There's no reason to. Ensign Kim is capable of piloting the
shuttle for this mission. <br>
PARIS: Yeah, he's capable. That's not the point. <br>
JANEWAY: What is the point, Mister Paris? <br>
PARIS: Well, it's hard to explain, but this is my flight. <br>
JANEWAY: Your flight? <br>
PARIS: When I was a boy, my father used to tell me that I was special,
that one day I'd do something significant. My teachers at school, all
the kids, everyone used to say, Tom Paris is going to do something
important when he grows up. Obviously, that didn't happen. <br>
JANEWAY: This isn't about personal redemption. We're talking about
medical risk. Your life could be in danger, and we need you. <br>
PARIS: Captain, this is the first time in ten years I feel I have a
life to risk. <br>
JANEWAY: You're sure about this? <br>
PARIS: Captain, I've never been so sure about anything. Please. Please
let me make the flight. <br>

said warp ten. And then, as I watched it, I suddenly realised that I
was watching myself as well. I could see the outside of the shuttle, I
could see Voyager, I could see inside Voyager. I could see inside this
room. For a moment, I was everywhere. I mean, everywhere, Captain. With
the Kazon, back home, with the Klingons, other galaxies. It was all
there. I don't know how else to explain it. It was like. Well, no, it
wasn't like anything. <br>

offline and ended up back where I started. But, oh, it's starting to
slip away. It all was so vivid, and now <br>

This data describes literally every cubic centimetre in this sector.
It's over five billion gigaquads of information. <br>
JANEWAY: It would appear that the theory of infinite velocity is
correct. It may be possible to occupy every point in the universe
simultaneously. <br>
TORRES: Then it's just a matter of navigation. If we could figure out
how to come out of transwarp at a specific point, this could get us
home. <br>
JANEWAY: It could do more than that. It could change the very nature of
our existence. Think of it. There would be nothing beyond our reach.
This telemetry is giving us an invaluable record of this sector. We can

EMH: The alveoli in his lungs are mutating. He's no longer processing
oxygen. <br>

bay. Computer, remove all the air from within the forcefield and
replace it with eighty percent nitrogen and twenty percent
acidichloride. He can breath, for now. <br>

experience on the shuttle. <br>

know more about what happened on that shuttle, and I need to know it
now. Radiation levels, unexplained anomalies, anything. <br>

mutation. <br>

PARIS: Great. Now it'll read, beloved radioactive mutant. <br>
EMH: No effect. Increase the dosage to eighty five rads per second. I'm
going to try inhibiting the cell mitosis with a biosuppresser field. <br>
PARIS: Big funeral with lots of pretty girls all crying. Except Torres.
Torres doesn't cry. Did you ever notice that? I don't trust people who
don't cry. Of course, my father, he'd say crying is a sign of weakness.
I never believed that. Do you cry? <br>
EMH: It's not in my programme. <br>
PARIS: Shame. You know, it's funny. What I remember most about being a
kid are the times I spent in my room crying. I liked my room, though.
It was quiet in there. People would leave me alone. I'd keep the door
locked, read, play games. I lost my virginity in that room. Seventeen.
Parents were away for the weekend. <br>
EMH: I'll note that in your medical file. <br>
PARIS: Ow! <br>
EMH: His lymphatic system is collapsing. Increase dosage to ninety
eight rads per second. <br>

PARIS: Consider it a last request. <br>
KES: I'm sorry, Tom. If we let down the forcefield, you'll suffocate. <br>
PARIS: Oh, what's the difference? I'm dying anyway. Do me a favour.
When I'm gone, call Starfleet Headquarters and tell Dad that I did it.
Tell him <br>
EMH: Prepare to activate the neural stimulator. <br>
KES: Ready. <br>
EMH: Now! Again. Again! No neural activity. <br>
KES: We can try to revive him. <br>
EMH: His cell membranes have degraded. There's nothing more we can do.
Computer, remove the acidichloride gas from the isolation field and
deactivate the field. It will be necessary for us to perform an autopsy
on the Lieutenant's body in the morning. Until then, I suggest you get
some rest. <br>
(Kes kisses Paris' cheek, and leaves. Later, the EMH is working in his
office when he hears a strange creaking sound. He follows the sound
into the surgical bay, and pulls back the sheet from the body.) <br>

it? You're jealous that I broke the transwarp barrier, and now you're
hoping I'll die! <br>
JANEWAY: You're right, Doctor. I don't think there's anything I can do
here. <br>
PARIS: Wait, Captain. I'm sorry. Please come back. I know you're doing
what you can. It's just, I'm scared. I didn't mean to lash out at you. <br>
JANEWAY: What you're going through would scare any of us, but you have
to hang on, Tom. We're doing everything we can to help you. <br>
PARIS: I know you are. And I know you'll fail! <br>
(Paris bounces off a forcefield.) <br>
PARIS: You know, I used to look up to you. But now you seem so small,
so insignificant. You don't even know what, what, what <br>
(He coughs out his tongue. Later -) <br>
KES: Doctor, the rate of genetic mutation has accelerated by twelve
percent. <br>
EMH: I want you to run a nucleogenic scan to determine how much of his
original DNA is left intact. In the meantime, I'm going to see about
treating him with <br>
PARIS: Doctor! <br>
(Paris is sitting on the floor, holding his feet.) <br>
EMH: What is it now, Mister Paris? <br>
PARIS: I need to talk. <br>
EMH: So I've noticed. Is it urgent? I'm rather busy right now. <br>
PARIS: Urgent. Yes, urgent. Let me out of here. <br>
EMH: I'm afraid that's not possible. <br>
PARIS: Please. I can't stay here. I have to get off this ship. <br>
KES: Leave Voyager? Why? <br>
PARIS: I understand. It's all so clear now. <br>
EMH: What do you understand? <br>
PARIS: The present, the past, they're both in the future. The future is
in the past. <br>
EMH: I beg your pardon? <br>
PARIS: Listen to me! I am more. I'm everything. Let me go. <br>
KES: Go where, Tom? <br>
PARIS: I can't! Please. Please! <br>
EMH: Something tells me we'd better hurry.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH [on
monitor]: I believe the answer lies in forcing his DNA to revert to its
original coding. Once that occurs, his body should return to its former
state. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How do we do that? <br>
EMH [on monitor]: We destroy all of the new DNA in his body. His cells
will have to use the original coding as a blueprint. But the only way
to destroy the mutant DNA is with highly focused antiproton radiation. <br>
TORRES: Antiprotons? The only place on this ship which generates
antiprotons is the warp core. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: Exactly. I'd like to place Mister Paris in an
isotopic restraint and then infuse it with controlled antiproton
bursts. A tricky venture, but I see no other alternative. <br>
TORRES: We'll have to take the warp core offline, then I'll need about
three hours to set up an interface. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: In three hours, there won't be anything left of
Mister Paris to save. We have to make the attempt within an hour, at
the most. <br>
JANEWAY: Get moving.

had to live in when he had no lungs.) <br>
EMH [on monitor]: What's your status, Lieutenant? <br>
TORRES: The interface is charged and ready. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: Infuse him with a two second antiproton burst. <br>
TORRES: Take the warp engines offline. Bleed off point zero five seven
AMUs of antiproton radiation. Shunt it through the interface. <br>
JONAS: Transfer underway. <br>

Doctor, the mutated DNA in his liver cells has begun to deteriorate,
but the original coding isn't taking over. <br>

the duration of the bursts. Lieutenant, prepare a five second burst.
Also, you'll need to begin depolarising the <br>

He used a phaser on the port plasma conduit. We have power failures all
over the ship. <br>

draws her phaser and turns, but Mutant Paris leaps on her, and the shot

Phaser discharge on deck six. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Localise it. <br>
KIM: I'm still having trouble with internal sensors. It came from
somewhere between sections twenty one and twenty seven alpha. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok doesn't have any security in that area. Chakotay to
Tuvok. We think Paris may be on deck six. Deploy security to sections
twenty one through twenty seven alpha. <br>
(Paris gently puts Janeway on the floor of a shuttlecraft, then takes
the helm.) <br>
KIM: Commander, someone's depressurising shuttlebay two. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What? <br>
KIM: There's a launch in progress. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tractor beam. <br>
KIM: It's offline. <br>
TUVOK [OC]: Tuvok to Bridge. We found the Captain's phaser on deck six,
but there's no sign of her. <br>
(The shuttlecraft launches and goes to warp.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maintain a sensor lock on that shuttle. <br>
KIM: I've got main power back. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Engage warp engines. Follow them. <br>
CREWWOMAN: Aye, Commander. <br>
KIM: They're approaching warp nine point nine. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Increase speed to match. <br>

is imminent. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Are we in tractor range? <br>
KIM: No, and they're still accelerating. Warp nine point nine seven. <br>

CHAKOTAY: Reduce sped to warp nine point five. Keep a sensor lock on
them as long as you can. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH:
I've re-examined the data on Mister Paris' transformation, and I think
I understand what's happening to him. The mutations we observed are
natural. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Natural? <br>
EMH: The changes in his DNA are consistent with the evolutionary
development of the human genotype observed over the past four million
years. Increased brain capacity, the loss of vestigial organs. <br>
TUVOK: Are you saying Lieutenant Paris is evolving? <br>
EMH: That's my theory. The only difference between natural evolution
and what happened to Mister Paris is that his changes took place over a
twenty four hour period. Somehow, travelling at infinite velocity
accelerated the natural human evolutionary process by millions of
years. It's possible that Mister Paris represents a future stage in
human development, although I can't say it's very attractive. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What do we do about it? <br>
EMH: I think my antiproton approach was correct. However, I'll need to
intensify the treatment to restore his original DNA. <br>
KIM [OC]: Bridge to Chakotay. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Go ahead. <br>
KIM [OC]: I think I've found the shuttlecraft, Commander. It's on the
fourth planet, in one of the jungles near the equator. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Acknowledged. Tuvok, have a security team meet us in
Transporter room three.

A pair of giant salamanders are lying on the shore by a river. Tuvok
and Chakotay, and two security guards, beam down. The salamanders react
to their torches, and Chakotay stuns them.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: There are traces of human DNA. It's them. But I have to
admit, I'm not sure which one is the Captain. <br>
TUVOK: The female, obviously. <br>
(Three baby salamanders emerge from a hole in the sand and slither off

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH:
I've eradicated all traces of the mutant DNA from your system and
restored your original genome. Congratulations. You're human again. <br>
JANEWAY: Thank you, Doctor. <br>
EMH: Captain, it'll take some time for your genetic codes to stabilise.
I'd like you to remain in Sickbay for the next three days, just to be
safe. <br>
JANEWAY: Excuse me. <br>
PARIS: Captain, er <br>
JANEWAY: I've thought about having children, but I must say I never
considered having them with you. <br>
PARIS: Captain, I'm sorry. I, I don't know what to say, except I don't
remember very much about, er, you know <br>
JANEWAY: What makes you think it was your idea? Sometimes it's the
female of the species that initiates mating. But apology accepted,
nonetheless. You may be interested to know I'm putting you in for a
commendation. Regardless of the outcome, you did make the first
transwarp flight. <br>
PARIS: Thank you, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Is there something wrong, Lieutenant? <br>
PARIS: I don't know. I guess this whole experience has left me feeling
a little overwhelmed. Flying at warp ten, evolving into a new life
form, mating, having alien offspring. <br>
JANEWAY: You've broken more than one record, that's for sure. <br>
PARIS: Breaking the threshold. It was incredible. But somehow it
doesn't mean as much as I thought it would. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh? <br>
PARIS: I guess I went into this looking for a quick fix. I thought
making history would change things. Not just my service record, my
reputation. <br>
JANEWAY: If I'm not mistaken, you've changed quite a few minds on this
ship. You've earned a lot of people's respect and admiration. <br>
PARIS: Yeah. But I'm starting to realise that it's not other people's
opinions I should be worried about. It's mine. It seems, Captain, that
I still have a few barriers to break. I just hope they're not
theoretical impossibilities. <br>
JANEWAY: Somehow, I don't think they will be. </font> </p>
