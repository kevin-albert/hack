Captain's log, stardate 41798.2. We have been ordered by Starfleet to
proceed to the Lorenze Cluster and investigate the disappearance of a
light cruiser, USS Drake, which was in that system trying to unravel a
mystery of its own which began when recent long range probes indicated
that all intelligent life on the planet Minos has disappeared.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Number One? <br>
RIKER: No help from their communications log. The Drake reported
arriving at Minos and then wasn't heard from again. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data? <br>
DATA: The citizens of Minos gained fame during the Ersalrope wars as
arms merchants. They manufactured sophisticated and highly advanced
weaponry. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah? For which side? <br>
DATA: Both. <br>
LAFORGE: We are approaching the planet Minos, sir. <br>
PICARD: Standard orbit, Mister La Forge. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. Standard orbit. <br>
RIKER: Whatever happened to the Drake, happened quickly, otherwise a
man like Rice would have reported again. <br>
PICARD: You know Captain Rice? <br>
RIKER: We were at the Academy together. <br>
PICARD: Tell me about him. <br>
RIKER: Able. A good officer. <br>
TROI: How would he react under stress? <br>
RIKER: Paul Rice is confident to the point of arrogance, he but carries
it well because he's usually right. He's a risk taker. <br>
PICARD: Really? <br>
RIKER: I'll give you an example. One of the final tests in advance
navigation at the Academy provides the student with three options. Rice
was given this test, rejected their options and offered one of his own.
<br>
PICARD: That's taking a risk. <br>
RIKER: And it paid off. He received the top grade and now that same
test has four options. <br>
TROI: In a difficult situation a man like that would act aggressively. <br>
RIKER: Agreed. <br>
WORF: Commander, weren't you offered the Drake? <br>
RIKER: Yes. <br>
TASHA: You gave up your own command to take this assignment? <br>
RIKER: At the time I thought it would be more advantageous for me to do
a tour on the Enterprise. <br>
DATA: Captain, readings correspond with the findings of the probe. No
signs of intelligent life forms. Vegetation and animal life only. <br>
TROI: What happened to all the people? <br>
WORF: War? <br>
DATA: Disease? <br>
LAFORGE: A dissatisfied customer? <br>
TASHA: In any war, natural disaster, even the most virulent plague,
there are always survivors. <br>
DATA: Captain, we are being hailed. <br>
RIKER: How can that be from a planet with no people? <br>
PICARD: Your sensors indicated no intelligent life forms? <br>
DATA: Correct, sir. Something has scanned our language banks and is
hailing us. <br>
PICARD: On main viewer. <br>
SALESMAN [on viewscreen]: Whoever you are, wherever you're from,
greetings. Welcome to Minos, the arsenal of freedom. <br>
PICARD: I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS <br>
SALESMAN [on viewscreen]: If you need a little something special, be it
for one target or multiple targets, we got it. You'll see it here on
Minos, where we live by the motto 'peace through superior firepower'. <br>
PICARD: To whom am I speaking? <br>
SALESMAN [on viewscreen]: To be totally armed is to be totally secure.
Remember, the early bird that hesitates gets wormed. <br>
DATA: It is a recorded message, sir. <br>
SALESMAN [on viewscreen]: Minos, the arsenal of freedom. Perfection in
highly advanced weaponry. Versatility. <br>
PICARD: We must have triggered something left over from the Erselrope
wars when the arms business was booming. <br>
SALESMAN [on viewscreen]: So lock on to my signal and beam on down,
because we don't just provide weapons <br>
PICARD: Shut that off. <br>
SALESMAN [on viewscreen]: We provide complete weapons systems. <br>
LAFORGE: It's a heck of a sales pitch. <br>
PICARD: If an automated message system is still functioning, there
could be other systems on that planet that are still operational. <br>
TASHA: Weapons systems? <br>
PICARD: Possibly. <br>
RIKER: We're going to have to go down there to find it. <br>
PICARD: Number One, prepare am away team. <br>
RIKER: Lieutenant Yar. Data. <br>
TASHA: Commander, I recommend a minimum complement. <br>
RIKER: Oh? I would have thought otherwise. <br>
TASHA: We'll keep the first landing party small and mobile, until I'm
confident that whatever killed the inhabitants of this planet isn't
still down there. <br>
RIKER: Okay. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Aye, sir. <br>
DATA: Commander, our communications are being monitored. <br>
RIKER: By whom? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER [OC]: Captain? <br>

from here.

RIKER: What could do that? <br>
TASHA: I don't know. Whatever it was, it's beyond our technology. <br>
DATA: Over here. <br>
TASHA: Wow. <br>
(Data takes the moss from a big ray gun) <br>
RIKER: We've never even seen anything like this. <br>
TASHA: It's undamaged. <br>
RIKER: Maybe a demonstration model for some potential buyer. <br>
TASHA: Maybe. Let's spread out a little.

RICE: Hello. Commander Riker. <br>
RIKER: Rice! Where did you come from? <br>
RICE: I was over there. <br>
RIKER: We were worried about you. I should have known you'd pop up. <br>
RICE: How are you, Commander Riker? <br>
RIKER: Me? Forget about me. How are you? No word, no message, nothing. <br>
RICE: How many are with you? <br>
RIKER: There are two others. Where's the Drake? Where's your crew? <br>
PICARD [OC]: Number One, a word. We have some information you should be
aware of.

RIKER: Do you need medical help? <br>
RICE: No. What's your purpose here? <br>
RIKER: Commander Data, Lieutenant Yar. <br>
DATA: Sir, other than ourselves, I am picking up no life signs here. <br>
RIKER: I know. <br>
RICE: Riker, you didn't answer me. Who sent you here to look for me? <br>
RIKER: Your mother. She's worried about you. <br>
RICE: Tell me about your ship, Riker. It's the Enterprise, isn't it? <br>
RIKER: No. The name of my ship is the Lollipop. <br>
RICE: I have no knowledge of that ship. <br>
RIKER: It's just been commissioned. It's a good ship. <br>
RICE: Refresh me, would you, Riker? What's its size, it's complement? <br>
RIKER: Who is here with you? <br>
RICE: What's the armament on the Lollipop? <br>
RIKER: Paul, I will only answer your questions if you answer mine. Why
do you want to know so much about my ship? <br>
RICE: We're friends, aren't we? <br>
RIKER: Old friends. <br>
RICE: Our top speed is warp three. What's yours? <br>
RIKER: Is? Then the Drake has not been destroyed. <br>
RICE: The Drake? <br>
RIKER: Yes, your ship. <br>
RICE: Of course, my ship is the Drake. <br>
RIKER: Where is it? <br>
RICE: Classified. <br>
RIKER: Classified? <br>
RICE: Please, it's important. Our survival depends on knowing. What's
the armament on your ship? <br>
RIKER: Ten. <br>
RICE: Ten? I don't understand. Ten what? <br>
RIKER: Six. <br>
RICE: Commander Riker, your answers make no sense. <br>
RIKER: You haven't used my first name once, Paul. You remember it,
don't you? You don't, do you? Because you don't exist. You're a fake.
You're an image of the original, aren't you? Answer me! <br>
(Paul Rice disappears and a flying machine appears) <br>
PICARD [OC]: Report, Number One. <br>
RIKER: The image of Rice has been replaced by something which is
hovering several metres away.
