<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(A game of Velocity appears to consist
of two players taking turns at shooting phasers at a flying target. It
changes colour when a player hits it. Like squash, the target bounces
off the walls, too. Janeway runs into the wall and gets knocked down,
dropping her phaser. Then she grabs it up again and shoots the target
square on.)<br>COMPUTER: Full impact. Final round to Janeway. Winner Janeway. <br>
JANEWAY: Good game. <br>
SEVEN: For you. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, come on, Seven. You won four out of ten rounds. Nothing to be ashamed of. <br>
SEVEN: On the contrary. I have superior visual acuity and stamina. I
should have won every round. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, Velocity is more than a test of stamina. It's a game of
wits. <br>
SEVEN: You are a frustrating opponent. During the final round, after
you dropped your phaser, you did not look at the disk, and yet you were
able to acquire the target. <br>
JANEWAY: Intuition. <br>
SEVEN: Intuition is a human fallacy. The belief that you can predict
random events. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, belief had nothing to do with it. At some level, conscious
or otherwise, I was aware of several factors. The trajectory of the
disk after I hit the wall, the sound it made on its return, and the
shadow it cast on the hologrid. <br>
SEVEN: Intriguing but implausible. <br>
JANEWAY: I won, didn't I? Thanks for the match. <br>
SEVEN: I wish to play again. <br>
JANEWAY: Not today. <br>
SEVEN: You are fatigued and concerned that I will defeat you. <br>
JANEWAY: Tired? Yes. Concerned? No. <br>

Captain's log, stardate 51978.2. It's been five months since we
received the encoded message from the Alpha Quadrant. We know that the
transmission was from Starfleet Command but we still can't decrypt it.
B'Elanna thinks it's a lost cause, that too much of the datastream has
been destroyed. But I haven't given up. I keep hoping inspiration will
strike, somehow. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Mess

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Janeway is working on the decryption.)<br>CHAKOTAY: Good morning. <br>
JANEWAY: What time is it? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Oh five hundred. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh. Well then, good morning. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I just heard from Tom and Neelix. They're about to leave the
trading colony. <br>
JANEWAY: Any luck? <br>
CHAKOTAY: According to Tom, the shuttle's so loaded down with supplies,
he won't make half impulse. Neelix is asking permission to bring one of
the locals on board. He's been very helpful, and Neelix wants to repay
him by giving him passage to the next system. <br>
JANEWAY: Permission granted. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You might want to grab some sleep. We've got a big day ahead.
<br>
JANEWAY: I will in a while. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Still hunting for buried treasure? <br>
JANEWAY: We've found the treasure, I just can't pick the lock. I've
tried
over fifty decryption algorithms. Every time I piece together a
datablock, ten more come unravelled. What did Starfleet send us? A map?
The location of a wormhole? If I could decode this today, Chakotay, we
could be home tomorrow. Then again, it could be Admiral Chapman's
recipe for the perfect pound cake. I've been pinning our hopes on this
message, but I'm starting to wonder. <br>
CHAKOTAY: One way or another, we've got to find out. I'll talk to
B'Elanna. You could enlist Seven of Nine. <br>
JANEWAY: She should have a few Borg algorithms up her sleeve. If she's
in the mood. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Problems? <br>
JANEWAY: I don't know if she's getting restless or if it's just me, but
we're butting heads more than usual lately. She seems to challenge
everything I say. <br>
CHAKOTAY: She's learned a lot from you over the last year. Maybe the
pupil thinks she's outgrowing the mentor. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe. Well, this mentor would like another cup of coffee.
Will you join me? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Love to. </font></p>

This goes to Engineering. Sickbay. Storage. <br>(A crewwoman holds up a jellyfish.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: I hope that's not going to the mess hall. <br>
PARIS: I don't remember what this is. Neelix! <br>
NEELIX: Captain, this man is a genius. I was trying to negotiate with a
xenon-based lifeform when the Universal Translator went offline.
Arturis here stepped in and acted as a perfect go-between, and he'd
never heard either of our languages. <br>(Arturis is a bald, slightly large-headed humanoid.)<br>
ARTURIS: Oh, they were simple. No insult intended. <br>
PARIS: Neelix! <br>
NEELIX: On my way. If you two will excuse me. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, welcome to Voyager. We may be a linguistically simple
folk but we're happy to give you a ride. Let's see if we can find you
some quarters. <br>
ARTURIS: Neelix was right. Voyager is a welcoming place. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, we do our best. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: I can't say I've ever met a living Universal Translator. <br>
ARTURIS: My people have a way with languages. I myself know over four
thousand. <br>
JANEWAY: And to think I still struggle with basic Klingon. You couldn't
have heard Neelix say more than a few phrases. <br>
ARTURIS: It was all I needed. It was enough to grasp the grammar and
syntax. <br>
JANEWAY: Impressive. <br>
ARTURIS: Not really. It's a natural ability. Some species are born with
great physical prowess. Others, like yours, with a generosity of
spirit. My people can see patterns where others see only confusion. Is
something wrong? <br>
JANEWAY: No. Tell me, how are you at computational languages?
Algorithms, trinary syntax? <br>
ARTURIS: It's all the same to me. <br>
JANEWAY: I was wondering if you might do us another favour. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
ARTURIS: You weren't exaggerating, Captain. This datastream is badly
damaged. I'd like to see the entire transmission again. Are you Borg? <br>
SEVEN: Yes. <br>
ARTURIS: You're much more attractive than the average drone. <br>
SEVEN: I am no longer part of the Collective. <br>
ARTURIS: I see, I see. I think I see the problem. May I? <br>
JANEWAY: Please. <br>(Seven allows Arturis to use the console.)<br>JANEWAY: Have you encountered his people before? <br>
SEVEN: Species one one six. <br>
ARTURIS: Is that what you call us? <br>
SEVEN: Yes. The Borg has never been able to assimilate them. Not yet. <br>
JANEWAY: Seven. <br>
ARTURIS: Oh, it's all right, Captain. The Borg Collective is like a force
of nature. You don't feel anger toward a storm on the horizon, you just
avoid it. Ah. Here it is. It's a simple matter of extracting the
iconometric elements, and triaxilating a recursion matrix. <br>
JANEWAY: Now why didn't I think of that? <br>
ARTURIS: There's a great deal of information here, Captain. I think it might be useful to utilise the other monitors. <br>(They call the message up on the big screen.)<br>
JANEWAY: You've done it. <br>
ARTURIS: Almost. I've reconstructed over sixty eight kiloquads of
information, but a lot of it is still garbled. <br>
JANEWAY: What about that datablock. Fourteen beta? <br>
ARTURIS: That part of the message is too degraded to recover. <br>
SEVEN: Captain, I've found a spatial grid. <br>(6-98 381-33 02-77 913-41, I think.)<br>
JANEWAY: They've marked a set of coordinates. It's less than ten light
years from here. <br>
SEVEN: Maybe Starfleet wants us to proceed to that location. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe. There's only one way to find out. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PARIS:
We're approaching the coordinates. <br>
JANEWAY: Take us out of warp. Scan the vicinity. <br>
TUVOK: I am picking up a vessel. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Identify. <br>
TUVOK: Unless I am mistaken, Captain, the warp signature is Starfleet. <br>(It is a sleek silver Delta wing.)<br>
PARIS: I'll be damned. They came through. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: Hailing them. No response. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Lifesigns? <br>
SEVEN: There is no organic matter of any kind. <br>
KIM: No sign of damage to the outer hull. Primary systems are online
including life support. Something must have happened to the crew. <br>
JANEWAY: The answer is somewhere in that Starfleet transmission. We
need to finish decoding it. May I call on your talents again? <br>
ARTURIS: Of course. <br>
JANEWAY: Take an away team. Secure the vessel. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tom. Tuvok. <br>
ARTURIS: Captain. I won't pretend to know you well, but I am surprised
you're not more encouraged by this discovery. <br>
JANEWAY: I've learned to walk the line between hope and caution. We've
had other opportunities that didn't work out. But I will admit, I'm
leaning toward hope this time. </font></p>

Wow. <br>
TUVOK: Wow indeed. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I've never seen this kind of hull geometry. Looks like
they've taken a whole new approach to starship design. <br>
TUVOK: USS Dauntless. Registry NX-01A. Launch Date 51472. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Sixty thousand light years in three months? <br>
TUVOK: I'm trying to access the crew logs but there are none. <br>
PARIS: I don't think there was a crew. This helm was set for
auto-navigation to these coordinates. <br>
TUVOK: It appears that Starfleet has provided us with a new ship. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Let's not pack our bags just yet. I'd like to know how they <br>(Beep!)<br>
PARIS: I'm reading power fluctuations in the warp core, if you can call
it a warp core. I don't recognise this engine configuration. <br>(The ship shakes.)<br>

this thing a quantum slipstream drive. <br>

Captain's log, supplemental. After two days at high warp, we've
rendezvoused with the Dauntless. Arturis has helped us reconstruct most

together. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> ADMIRAL
HAYES [on monitor]: Slipstream technology is experimental and
high risk, but it's come a long way in the past year. We've conducted
forty seven trial runs, all of them successful. But each flight lasted
only five days. In order to reach Earth, you'd have to remain at
slipstream velocities for a full three months. Can your crew survive
that long? We believe they can, and we encourage you to try. Everything
you'll need is on the Dauntless. Power cells, supplies, living
quarters. Safe journey. We hope to see you soon. <br>
JANEWAY: Admiral Hayes. Good man, fine officer, bit of a windbag. Let's
talk about the risk. Doctor? <br>
EMH: I've examined the away team for signs of cell damage or
physiological stress. Nothing. Their little joyride didn't harm them in
the slightest. <br>
JANEWAY: Long term effects? <br>
EMH: I'm running medical projections right now. So far, the results are
encouraging. <br>
JANEWAY: And the Dauntless itself? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'd say it's in pretty good shape, considering. <br>
TORRES: I've been looking over the primary systems. Helm, Ops,
Tactical, they're comparable to Voyager's. But it's a lean ship,
Captain. No shuttlecraft, only one transporter, no holodecks, no
replicators. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, Mister Neelix, you may have your work cut out for you. <br>
NEELIX: Ready and willing, Captain. <br>
KIM: So what are we waiting for? <br>
SEVEN: Your enthusiasm is premature. Voyager is a proven vessel. It
would be reckless to abandon it so quickly. <br>
KIM: Come on, where's that Borg spirit? We'll adapt. <br>
SEVEN: My Borg spirit gives me an objectivity you lack. <br>
TUVOK: She has a point. This would mean leaving Voyager behind. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Is there any way we could modify Voyager to create a
slipstream? <br>
PARIS: In theory, but I don't think the ship would hold up very long
under the quantum stresses. <br>
JANEWAY: Try to make the modifications. If there's a way we can bring
Voyager along for the ride, I'm all for it. Harry, B'Elanna, I want you
to take an Engineering team down to the Dauntless. Start working on a
way to shut down the slipstream drive at a moment's notice. <br>
TORRES: Aye, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Once we have that safeguard in place, we can start making
the test flights. I want this entire crew to familiarise themselves with
that ship. See to it. Dismissed. Tuvok. Big day. <br>
TUVOK: Indeed. <br>
JANEWAY: A way home. We've&nbsp;waited for this moment for years. Why
don't I feel more enthusiastic? <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps my mental discipline is rubbing off on you. <br>
JANEWAY: Perhaps. What do you think about this little miracle of ours? <br>
TUVOK: I share your concern about the crew's safety. We must take every
precaution. <br>
JANEWAY: Somehow I don't think standard diagnostics and security
protocols are going to make me feel any better. <br>
TUVOK: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: All of this is just a little too perfect. The alien genius
with the answers to all our problems. A message from Starfleet telling
us everything we want to hear. A starship delivered right to our
doorstep. What more could we ask for? They even turned down the beds.
The only thing missing was chocolates on the pillows. <br>
TUVOK: It does seem convenient. <br>
JANEWAY: I can't put my finger on it, but from the moment this all
started I sensed something was wrong. <br>
TUVOK: It started when Arturis boarded Voyager. <br>
JANEWAY: Exactly. We'll proceed as planned, but I want you to
investigate that ship from stem to stern. Keep an eye on our guest. See
if you can find out more about him. <br>
TUVOK: Understood. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's hope we're just suffering from some good old-fashioned
paranoia. Keep me posted. </font></p>

Captain's log, supplemental. So far, the crew hasn't found any evidence
to support my doubts about Arturis. Nevertheless, I've told them to
keep looking and to keep their optimism in check. But that's one order
I don't expect them to follow to the letter. <br></font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Daily
log, Seven of Nine, Stardate 51981.6. I've analysed the quantum
slipstream technology of the Dauntless. It is similar to the transwarp
drive used by the Borg. As a result, my expertise will be crucial to
the mission's success. Voyager's crew is counting on that success but I
find myself ambivalent, so I'm carrying out my </font><font face="Arial" size="2">assignment, nothing
more. </font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Janeway's log continues.) Despite my apprehension, I

the control sequencers. <br>
SEVEN: Lieutenant, you seem eager to return to Earth. <br>
TORRES: Eager? I wouldn't go that far. <br>
SEVEN: You were a member of the Maquis. Starfleet Command will no doubt
hold you responsible for a multitude of crimes. You will find nothing
on Earth but adversity. <br>
TORRES: That's looking on the bright side. Let's put it this way. I'd
rather face the music back home than spend the rest of my life in the
Delta Quadrant. What about you? Looking forward to seeing Earth? <br>
SEVEN: No. <br>
TORRES: I'm not surprised. You think people are going to resent an
ex-Maquis? What about an ex-drone? We'll be outcasts together. I'm
kidding, Seven. It's a joke. Work on that sense of humour. It'll help
you make friends on Earth. <br>

anomalous energy surge. <br>

KIM: Believe me, Seven, one look at that big blue marble, and you'll
fall in love. It's got just about every ecosystem you can think of, and
hundreds of different humanoid species live there. Bolians, Vulcans,
Ktarians. If you like Ktarians. And there are several other planets to
choose from. <br>

JANEWAY: Computer, display datablock fourteen beta, auxiliary display.
<br>(The doors open.)<br>JANEWAY: Seven, I could use your help. I'm trying to reconstruct the last
fragment of the Starfleet message. <br>
SEVEN: Arturis said it was irreparably damaged. <br>
JANEWAY: I know, but I think he gave up too easily. <br>
SEVEN: Intuition? <br>
JANEWAY: It's intuition if I'm right. I've designed a new decryption
algorithm. Let's give it a try. <br>
SEVEN: Captain. I will not be going with you to the Alpha Quadrant. <br>
JANEWAY: I can understand your reluctance. It's been hard enough
dealing with a crew of a hundred and fifty individual humans. The
prospect of an entire planet must be overwhelming. <br>
SEVEN: I am not overwhelmed. I simply do not wish to live among humans.
<br>
JANEWAY: Well, whether you like it or not, you're one of us. You've come
a long way from that drone who stepped out of a Borg alcove nine months
ago. Don't turn your back on humanity now. Not when you're about to
take your biggest step. Earth. Your home. <br>
SEVEN: I may have come a long way, but not in the direction you think.
You've attempted to influence my development. You exposed me to your
culture, you ideals. You hoped to shape me in your own image. But you
have failed. You may have noticed our tendency to disagree. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, I've noticed. <br>
SEVEN: Then you must also recognise that I do not share your values.
Your desire to explore space is inefficient. Your need for familial
connections is a weakness. Your infatuation with this planet is
irrational. <br>
JANEWAY: I won't argue that you've turned out differently than I
expected, and that we often have conflicting points of view. But right
now, the stakes are higher. This crew needs your expertise. Abandon them
and you diminish their chances of getting home. <br>
SEVEN: Irrelevant. <br>
JANEWAY: No, it's not. We've given you a lot, Seven. It's time you gave
something in return. <br>
SEVEN: I have, on many occasions. Now I refuse. <br>
JANEWAY: What would you do, go back to the Collective? <br>
SEVEN: I don't know. <br>
JANEWAY: Then what exactly do you have in mind? <br>
SEVEN: I don't know. <br>
JANEWAY: That's my point. You're asking me to cast you adrift in the
Delta Quadrant alone and without support. I wouldn't grant that request to
any member of this crew because it's too dangerous. <br>
SEVEN: I will survive. <br>
JANEWAY: On what, Borg perfection? <br>
SEVEN: Precisely. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't buy it. This isn't about your independence or your
superiority. This is about your fear. You're not making this choice
because you've outgrown humanity. I think you're afraid to go back to
Earth. <br>(Beep.)<br>JANEWAY: The algorithm's working. It's reconstructing the datablock.
That's strange, I thought we already recovered this part of the
message. <br>
SEVEN: Perhaps it is an addendum from the Admiral. You did designate
him a windbag. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, I don't think so. The data index doesn't match. This is a
completely different message. <br>
ADMIRAL HAYES [on monitor]: Apologies from everyone at Starfleet
Command. We've had our best people working around the clock, trying to
find a wormhole, a new means of propulsion, anything to get you home.
But despite our best efforts. I know it's not what you were hoping, but
we've sent you all the data we've collected on the Delta Quadrant. With
any luck, you'll find at least some part of it useful. Maybe enough to
shave a few years off your journey. Safe journey. We hope to see you
soon. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Arturis goes to the helm and is about to press a button flashing red.)<br>TORRES:
Don't touch that! You almost kicked us into slipstream drive. <br>
ARTURIS: Oh. I wouldn't want to do that. Kucha meRah. <br>(He should say jIQaqh, according to Klingonese experts.)<br>
TORRES: No problem. You speak Klingon. <br>
ARTURIS: I do now. Your captain was kind enough to let me review your
linguistic database. <br>
TORRES: I only know speak a few phrases myself. <br>
ARTURIS: Oh, shame. It's a robust language. <br>
TORRES: A little too robust for me. <br>(Janeway beams in with Seven and two security guards.)<br>
JANEWAY: Evacuate the repair teams. <br>
TORRES: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: Do it. Explain yourself. <br>
ARTURIS: I don't know what you're talking about. <br>
JANEWAY: You fabricated the message from Starfleet. I recovered the
real transmission. The one you said was irreparably damaged. <br>
ARTURIS: That's absurd. <br>
JANEWAY: Starfleet didn't send us this vessel and you're not here to
help. Is this your ship? <br>
ARTURIS: Please, stay calm, There must be an explanation. <br>
JANEWAY: I tried to ignore my gut feelings, because I got carried away
by the excitement of getting home. But you preyed on that, didn't you?
You took advantage of our hopes and now I want to know why. <br>
ARTURIS: I believe that there is a threat here, Captain, but not from
me. I didn't feel it was my place to make accusations, but I saw her
reconfigure several key algorithms two days ago in your Astrometrics
lab, and it seemed obvious. She must have been tampering with the
Starfleet message. <br>
SEVEN: You are lying. <br>
ARTURIS: She's been sabotaging your every effort to reach Earth. You
don't have to believe me, Captain. You can find all the evidence you
need in her personal database. <br>
JANEWAY: Evidence you undoubtedly put there yourself just in case you
got caught. Take him to Voyager. Throw him the brig. <br>(Arturis
beats off the two security guards. Tuvok phasers him in the abdomen,
but he still manages to pull a lever before they can drag him away from
the helm. The Dauntless transforms into an alien vessel, primary motif
- red. Then Arturis manages to set up a forcefield.)<br>JANEWAY: Janeway to
Voyager. Beam us out of here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Voyager

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
He's trying to deflect our transporters. Stand by. <br>(Tuvok is beamed away, then the security personnel. Janeway and Seven start to dematerialise, then solidify again.)<br>KIM:&nbsp; I've got everyone
but Seven and the Captain. He's found a way to block their transport. <br>
PARIS: The ship's going into slipstream mode. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Pursuit course. <br>PARIS: We lost them, Commander. <br>(Tuvok enters.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Tom, bring the warp core modifications online. We're going

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> SEVEN:
Where are you taking us? <br>
ARTURIS: Home. <br>
JANEWAY: How'd you create the Starfleet bridge? Holograms? <br>
ARTURIS: Particle synthesis. Beyond your understanding. <br>
JANEWAY: Is this what your people do? Prey on innocent ships? <br>
ARTURIS: Innocent? Typical of Captain Janeway. Self-righteous. <br>
JANEWAY: If I've offended you or your people in some way, please tell
me. <br>
ARTURIS: Diplomacy, Captain? Your diplomacy destroyed my world. <br>
JANEWAY: What? What are you saying? <br>
ARTURIS: You negotiated an agreement with the Borg Collective. Safe
passage through their space. And in return, you helped them defeat one
of their enemies. <br>
SEVEN: Species eight four seven two. <br>
ARTURIS: In your colourful language, yes. Species eight four seven two.
Did it ever occur to you that there were those of us in the Delta Quadrant who had a
vested interest in that war? Victory would have meant the annihilation
of the Borg, but you couldn't see beyond the bow of your own ship! <br>
JANEWAY: In my estimation, Species eight four seven two posed a greater
threat than the Borg. <br>
ARTURIS: Who are you to make that decision? A stranger to this
Quadrant. <br>
JANEWAY: There wasn't exactly time to take a poll. I had to act
quickly. <br>
ARTURIS: My people managed to elude the Borg for centuries. Outwitting
them, always one step ahead. But in recent years, the Borg began to
weaken our defences. They were closing in and Species eight four seven
two was our last hope to defeat them. You took that away from us! The
outer colonies were the first to fall. Twenty three in a matter of
hours. Our sentry vessels tossed aside, no defence against the storm.
By the time they'd surrounded our star system, hundreds of Cubes, we
had
already surrendered to our own terror. A few of us managed to survive.
Ten, twenty thousand. I was fortunate. I escaped with a vessel. Alone,
but alive. I don't blame them. They were just drones, acting with their
Collective instinct. You, you had a choice! <br>JANEWAY: I'm sorry for what
happened to your people, but try to understand. I couldn't have known. <br>
ARTURIS: It took me months to find you. I watched and waited for my
opportunity to make you pay for what you'd done. Then the Starfleet
message, and I knew that your selfish desire to get home would surface
again. That I could lure you to this vessel. That I could see to it
that you'd all be assimilated and spend the rest of eternity as Borg.
I was hoping to get your entire crew, but I'll settle for the two of
you. In a matter of hours, this ship will return to my homeworld. Inside
Borg space. <br>
SEVEN: When that happens, you will be assimilated as well. <br>
ARTURIS: That's irrelevant. This is what you wanted all along, isn't
it? To go back to your Collective? You should thank me. </font></p>

CHAKOTAY: Report. <br>
PARIS: We're at full impulse, but we're not breaking through the quantum
barrier. <br>
TUVOK: I'm having trouble controlling the field parameters. I need more
power to the deflector. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Bridge to Torres. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Voyager

Stand by. Reroute auxiliary power to Deflector Control. Make sure that

KIM: Make it quick. Hull temperature's at critical. <br>(Voyager enters the tunnel.)<br>
PARIS: We're at slipstream velocity. <br>
KIM: Structural integrity's down by nine percent. We've got less than
an hour before the hull starts to buckle. <br>
PARIS: I've located their slipstream. I'm aligning ours to match. We're
right behind them. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How far behind? <br>
PARIS: Just a few minutes. <br>
TUVOK: Is there any way to increase our speed? <br>
PARIS: None. We're at maximum. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maintain course. If I know the captain, she's already got a
plan. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Any ideas? <br>
SEVEN: Not presently. <br>
JANEWAY: We'd better think of something. We come face to face with your
former family in less than an hour, and that's one reunion I'd like to
miss. Unless of course, you're looking forward to rejoining the
Collective? <br>
SEVEN: I do not believe I am. <br>
JANEWAY: Not the ringing opposition I was hoping for, but I'll take it.
A drone could walk through this forcefield like it was thin air. Is
there enough Borg technology left in your body to let it adapt? <br>
SEVEN: If I activate the appropriate nanoprobes, I could alter my
bio-electric field. However, I would need to adjust my cranial implant.
<br>
JANEWAY: Would a micro-filament do the trick? <br>
SEVEN: It might. <br>
JANEWAY: Then let's get you one. Once you get outside, access that
control panel and disable the forcefield. Then we'll try to reach the
engine room. <br>
SEVEN: And employ the emergency shutdown procedure. <br>(Janeway opens her comm. badge and takes out an invisible wire.)<br>SEVEN: Sufficient. You
will need to cross-link the third and sixth nodules. <br>(Janeway uses the wire on the implant over Seven's eye.)<br>
JANEWAY: Déjà-vu. <br>
SEVEN: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: As I recall, this is where our relationship began. In a brig,
nine months ago. I severed you from the Collective and you weren't
exactly happy about it. <br>
SEVEN: No, I was not. <br>
JANEWAY: In case I never get a chance to say this, I realise that I've been
hard on you at times. But it was never out of anger, or regret that I
brought you on board. I'm your Captain. That means I can't always be
your friend. Understand? <br>
SEVEN: No. However, if we are assimilated, our thoughts will become one,
and I'm sure I will understand perfectly. A joke, Captain. You yourself
have encouraged me to use my sense of humour. <br>
JANEWAY: It's nice to know you've taken some of my advice to heart. <br>
SEVEN: You were correct. My desire to remain in the Delta Quadrant was
based on fear. I am no longer Borg, but the prospect of becoming human
is unsettling. I don't know where I belong. <br>
JANEWAY: You belong with us. <br>
SEVEN: The adaptations are complete. <br>(Seven
steps through the forcefield and goes to a control panel. The computer
alerts Arturis on the bridge. The forcefield is lowered.)<br>
JANEWAY: We're in business. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (The consoles are still in Starfleet configuration.)<br>SEVEN:
I can't initiate the emergency shutdown. <br>
JANEWAY: Our commands are being blocked from the bridge. He's detected
us. <br>
SEVEN: The ship's velocity has just increased. At our present speed, we
will enter Borg space in less than twelve minutes. <br>
JANEWAY: Do we still have access to the power distribution grid? <br>
SEVEN: Yes. <br>
JANEWAY: If we can't throw on the brakes, let's swerve the wheel. Send
a power surge into the starboard thrusters. <br>
SEVEN: The torsional stress at these speeds could tear the ship apart. <br>
JANEWAY: It's either that or join the Hive. Do it. If we're still in
one piece, try to gain control of navigation. I'll be on the bridge. We
have a game of Velocity scheduled for tomorrow, holodeck one. I expect
you to keep the appointment. <br>

minutes, Captain Janeway will be gone and a new drone will be born. <br>
JANEWAY: Don't count on it. Seven of Nine has accessed your
navigational systems. You taught us how to use this ship a little too
well. I can't begin to imagine your loss, but try to see beyond your
desire for revenge. <br>
ARTURIS: Revenge is all I have left. <br>
JANEWAY: No. As long you're alive there's hope. Your people's
accomplishments, their knowledge, their dignity, can survive in you.
End this. <br>(A console explodes in Engineering.)<br>

continue my efforts. <br>

are, practically laying in a course to Earth. <br>
SEVEN: As we approached Borg space I began to re-evaluate my future.
