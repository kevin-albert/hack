ODO: Enjoying the view? <br>
JAKE: I'm stuck on this new story I'm working on, and coming here helps
me focus. <br>
ODO: No need to explain, Mister Sisko. <br>
JAKE: I just thought <br>
ODO: You just thought what? <br>
JAKE: I thought you were going to ask me to leave. <br>
ODO: Why would I do that? <br>
JAKE: You always used to chase me away. <br>
ODO: I never chased you away. I chased Nog. You just happened to be
with him. So, unless you're planning on flicking sand peas at the
passing throng, you're welcome to stay here as long as you like. <br>
JAKE: I don't have any sand peas. <br>
ODO: You miss him, don't you? <br>
JAKE: Nog? Maybe a little. <br>
QUARK: A little? There isn't a day goes by that I don't see him
standing here, pining away for that no-good nephew of mine. <br>
JAKE: I'm not here every day. <br>
QUARK: No, just four or five times a week. If you ask me, Nog should
never have gone off to the Academy. You lost a friend, and I lost a
good waiter. <br>
JAKE: Nog'll be back, and he'll be wearing a Starfleet uniform. I'm
proud of what he's doing. <br>
QUARK: Remember that the next time you try to play dom-jot by yourself.
<br>
JAKE: You don't want me hanging around here? Fine. I'll do my thinking
someplace else. <br>
(Jake leaves.) <br>
QUARK: Poor kid. I suppose that's what you get for having friends. <br>
ODO: Meaning what? <br>
QUARK: Just that when you think you can count on them, they go off and
leave you. No. You're much better off without them. <br>
ODO: I imagine that's why you don't have any friends. <br>
QUARK: Look who's talking.

SISKO: This is the woman I told you about. The one I met in the
parallel universe. <br>
JAKE: So you're Jennifer Sisko, but you're just not my mom. <br>
JENNIFER: That's right. <br>
JAKE: You look exactly like her. <br>
JENNIFER: And I was married to a man who looked exactly like your
father. It's all a little confusing, isn't it? <br>
JAKE: More than a little. Did you tell her? <br>
SISKO: Tell her what? <br>
JAKE: Ever since my dad told me about you I've been wanting to meet

JENNIFER: Well, here I am. <br>
JAKE: You even sound like my mother. <br>
KIRA [OC]: Ops to Captain Sisko. <br>
SISKO: Go ahead. <br>
KIRA [OC]: Minister Gettor's shuttle has docked. <br>
SISKO: Give me a few minutes. Offer him a tour of the station. <br>
KIRA [OC]: I already have. His time here is limited and he's anxious to
meet with the Emissary. <br>
SISKO: I'll be right there. <br>
JAKE: So why are you here? <br>
JENNIFER: I came here to see your father. <br>
JAKE: Really? That's great. <br>
SISKO: Jennifer came to give me some good news. The Terrans have won an
important victory. <br>
JENNIFER: We've driven the Alliance off of the space station. <br>
JAKE: Then the rebels control Terok Nor. <br>
JENNIFER: I see your father has told you all about us. <br>
SISKO: I guess I'd better get to my meeting. <br>
JENNIFER: I understand. It's not like you were expecting me. <br>
JAKE: You're not leaving, are you? <br>
JENNIFER: Is it all right if I visit with Jake for a while? <br>
SISKO: I don't think Jake would have it any other way. <br>
JENNIFER: Maybe the three of us can have dinner together. <br>
SISKO: That depends on how long my meeting lasts. <br>
JENNIFER: We'll wait. <br>
SISKO: Okay. <br>

what people can do when their cause is just. <br>
SISKO: Save the speeches, Smiley. Right now, I don't care too much for
you or your cause. <br>
O'BRIEN: You've every right to be angry. We haven't exactly played fair
with you. <br>
SISKO: You kidnapped my son. <br>
O'BRIEN: Kidnapped? An ugly word. <br>
SISKO: But accurate. <br>
O'BRIEN: Tell me, Captain. If we had come and asked for your help in
fighting the Alliance, what would you have said? <br>
SISKO: I'd have said no. <br>
O'BRIEN: Which is why we had to use your son to lure you over here. We
need your help, Captain. No one else will do. <br>
(Brings up an image on the viewscreen.) <br>
O'BRIEN: Recognise her? <br>
SISKO: Wow. The Defiant. <br>
O'BRIEN: During our last encounter, when I visited your station, I took
a moment to download as many of your computer files as I could. I
figured they'd come in handy some day. And they have. You see, captain,
taking Terok Nor was one thing. Keeping it, that's the tricky part. The
Alliance fleet is already on its way. When they get here, I want to
have a proper welcome ready for them. <br>
SISKO: These schematics look complete. Why do you need me? If you want
to build another Defiant, why do you need my help? <br>
O'BRIEN: We've already built it. The problem is, when we power up its
engines, the whole ship damn near shakes itself apart. <br>
SISKO: We had the same trouble. It's a powerful ship. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, right now it's a little too powerful for its own good.
How did you solve it? <br>
SISKO: We had to overhaul the structural integrity field grids. <br>
O'BRIEN: How long did it take? <br>
SISKO: Two weeks. <br>
O'BRIEN: We have four days. <br>
SISKO: I'm not sure that's enough time. <br>
O'BRIEN: It'd better be. Otherwise the Defiant won't be ready, and you
and your son will die along with the rest of us. Or worse still, spend
the rest of your lives working in the ore processing centre under the
tender mercies of an Alliance overseer. Help us, Captain, and I promise
we'll get you and your son out of here before the fireworks begin. The
Defiant's at docking port five. I think you know the way. <br>
SISKO: I want to see my son first. <br>
O'BRIEN: I knew you would. <br>
BASHIR: Is he with us? <br>
O'BRIEN: You remember Captain Bashir. <br>
SISKO: Captain? <br>
O'BRIEN: Captain Bashir, Captain O'Brien, Captain Sisko. We may not
have enough troops or ships or weapons, but we have plenty of captains.
<br>
BASHIR: Is he going to help us or not? <br>
O'BRIEN: You must have missed that cheery face. Relax. The Captain has
found it in his heart to aid us once again. <br>
BASHIR: Good. <br>
(Bashir punches Sisko.) <br>
BASHIR: I owed you that. I let you hit me once because I thought you
were our Captain Sisko. Now I know better. <br>
SISKO: We're even now. <br>

JAKE: Dad. I'm sorry, but I had to come. Somehow, talking to Jennifer,
telling her all about the past nine years, about all the things that
happened to me, what I've done, what I've been thinking about. It's
like telling Mom. <br>
SISKO: In a lot of ways she's nothing like your Mom. <br>
JAKE: Yeah, but in some ways, she's just like her. And not just
physically. She listens like Mom. And it's the exact same smile. <br>
SISKO: Okay, Jake. <br>

Smiley told me all about you. About your wife's death, about your son.

SISKO: You're nothing like his mother. <br>

JENNIFER: Ben, you're the one that convinced me to join the rebels, to
fight the good fight for my people. <br>
SISKO: It's not your cause that I have a problem with, it's your
methods. <br>
JENNIFER: I'm sorry if Jake's feelings get hurt, but that's a small
price to pay if it means success against the Alliance. <br>

KIRA: I didn't lose anything. It was Garak and the rest of those
Alliance fools with their excessive brutality. I could never make them
to understand violence is a precision instrument. It's a scalpel, not a
club. <br>
SISKO: Garak was smart enough to escape. <br>
KIRA: Garak is a coward. He ran at the first sign of danger. <br>
SISKO: Probably straight into the Regent's arms, where he no doubt laid
the blame for the loss of this station entirely on you. <br>
KIRA: You have a point. <br>
SISKO: Good. Then I'll ask you again. Is there any weakness in the
Alliance fleet? Something we can exploit? <br>
KIRA: It's a possibility. Why don't you lower this forcefield and join
me in here? It might help stimulate my thought process. <br>
SISKO: I should think self-preservation would be stimulation enough for
you. <br>
KIRA: That's not a very friendly attitude, especially when you want my
help. Oh, it's Professor Sisko, isn't it. Well, she's very attractive
but I've known Breen icicles that are warmer than she is. <br>
SISKO: This has nothing to do with her. <br>
KIRA: If you say so. Still, I've never been able to resist anyone named
Benjamin Sisko. The Alliance ships are quick and powerful, but they do
have one weakness. Their targeting systems can be fooled. They've been
known to chase warp shadows. <br>
SISKO: How do I know I can believe you? <br>
KIRA: You're just going to have to trust me.

you've searched me three times already. Where could I possibly be
hiding it? <br>

SISKO: He has a forgiving nature. <br>
JENNIFER: It's more than that. I don't think he could be angry with me
even if he wanted to. I remind him too much of his mother. <br>
SISKO: He loved her very much. <br>
