Captain's log, Stardate 43539.1. We have moved into orbit around Bre'el
Four. With the assistance of the planet's emergency control centre,
we're investigating a potentially catastrophic threat to the population
from a descending asteroidal moon. </font>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: The satellite's trajectory is continuing to
deteriorate, Captain. This orbit will put it within five hundred
kilometres of the planet surface. <br>
GARIN [on viewscreen]: We're predicting the atmospheric drag will bring
it down on the next orbit. <br>
SCIENTIST [on viewscreen]: Have you been able to find any explanation
for this? <br>
DATA: No, Doctor. It is a most unusual phenomenon. <br>
PICARD: Won't the moon disintegrate prior to impact? <br>
SCIENTIST [on viewscreen]: No, it has a ferrous crystalline structure
and it will be able to withstand tidal forces, Captain <br>
RIKER: Could we blow it into pieces? <br>
DATA: The total mass of the moon would remain the same, Commander, and
the impact of thousands of fragments would spread destruction over an
even wider area. <br>
PICARD: How long before impact? <br>
DATA: Twenty nine hours, sir. Projecting it somewhere on the western
continent. That
would destroy an area eight hundred kilometres in radius. <br>
SCIENTIST [on viewscreen]: That damage would be insignificant, Captain,
compared to the seismic repercussions massive landquakes, and tsunami. <br>
GARIN [on viewscreen]: The force would raise a cloud of dust around the
planet, leading to a significant temperature reduction. We could be
looking at our own ice age. <br>
PICARD: Mister La Forge, is there any way that the Enterprise could
coax that satellite </font></p>

LAFORGE: We'd need to apply a delta vee of about four kilometres per
second. Even with warp power to the tractor beam, it would mean
exceeding recommended impulse engine output by at least forty-seven
percent. It'd be like </font></p>

RIKER: Given a choice between slim and none, I'll take slim any day. <br>
PICARD: Make it so. <br>
RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, contact all ships in this sector to rendezvous
and join us in relief efforts. <br>
PICARD: We'll keep you informed of our progress. Picard out. <br>
(The tiny tractor beam is sent out against the huge moon) <br>
RIKER: Can you give us any more, Geordi? <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: Not without burning out the tractor beam emitter. The
circuits are already beyond the thermal limit. <br>
DATA: Delta vee is ninety two metres per second. The mass is too great.
We are having an effect but it is negligible. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Our options? <br>
LAFORGE: We've done everything by the book and a little extra. We need
more time or more power, and we're short on both. I'll take a look and
see if there are any rules I haven't broken. <br>
PICARD: Keep me advised. <br>
(La Forge leaves. Q is now dressed in a pale mauve and olive jumpsuit) <br>
RIKER: We know you're behind this, Q. <br>
Q: These aren't my colours. And what are you blathering about, Riker? <br>
PICARD: What kind of twisted pleasure does it give you to bring terror
into their lives? <br>
Q: Whose lives? <br>
PICARD: The millions of people down there who are watching as their
moon falls out of the sky. <br>
Q: I haven't the vaguest idea what you're talking about and I have a
much more serious problem. I'm no longer a member of the Continuum. My
superiors have decided to punish me. <br>
PICARD: And punish us as well, it would seem. <br>
Q: They said I've spread chaos through the universe, and they've
stripped me of all my powers. You don't believe me, do you? Do you
think I would humiliate myself like this? <br>
RIKER: If it served your purpose, yes. <br>
Q: It's the truth. I stand before you defrocked. Condemned to be a
member of this lowest of species. A normal, imperfect, lumpen human
being. <br>
TROI: They made you human as part of your punishment? <br>
Q: No, it was my request. I could have chosen to exist as a Markoffian
sea lizard or a Belzoidian flea. Anything I
wished as long as it was mortal. And since I only had a fraction of a
second to mull and I chose this and asked them to bring me here. <br>
TROI: Why? <br>
Q: Because in all the universe you're the closest thing I have to a
friend, Jean-Luc. <br>
DATA: Sir, he is reading as fully human. <br>
Q: What, is there an echo in here? <br>
TROI: I am sensing an emotional presence, Captain. I would normally
describe it as being terrified. <br>
Q: How rude. <br>
PICARD: what is it you want, Q? <br>
Q: Your compassion. All right, Sanctuary on this ship, dreary as it may
sound to both of us. <br>
PICARD: Return that moon to its orbit. <br>
Q: I have no powers. Q the ordinary. <br>
PICARD: Q the liar. Q the misanthrope. <br>
Q: Q the miserable. Q the desperate. What must I do to convince you
people? <br>
WORF: Die. <br>
Q: Oh, very clever, Worf. Eat any good books lately? <br>
PICARD: Fine. You want to be treated as a human? <br>
Q: Absolutely. <br>
PICARD: All right. Mister Worf, throw him in the brig. <br>
WORF: Delighted, Captain. <br>
Q: You can't do this to me, Jean-Luc. <br>
WORF: You will walk or I will carry you. <br>
Q: Given the option, I'll walk. You've disappointed me, Jean-Luc. I'm
very disappointed. Hey, I'm claustrophobic, I don't like it in here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Turbolift]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Q: It was a mistake. I never should have picked
human. I knew it the minute I said it. To think of the future in this
shell. Forced to cover myself with fabric because of some outdated
human morality. To say nothing of being too hot or too cold,
growing feeble with age, losing my hair, catching a disease, being
ticklish, sneezing, having an itch, a pimple, bad breath. Having to
bathe. <br>
WORF: Too bad.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Q: Klingon. I should have said Klingon. In my heart
of hearts, I am a Klingon, Worf. <br>
(Q puts his hand on Worf's shoulder and quickly removes it) <br>
Q: Sorry. So you understand I could never survive in confinement. I
mean, this is cruel and unusual punishment.
The universe has been my back yard. As a fellow Klingon, if you would
speak to the Captain on my behalf, I would be eternally grateful. which
doesn't mean as much as it used to, I admit. <br>
WORF: Be quiet! Or disappear back where you came from. <br>
Q: I can't disappear any more than you could win a beauty contest. </font></p>

you might be able to answer it without it troubling your intellect too
much? (He enters the cell) <br>
Q: Ready? Here goes. Would I permit you to lock me away if I still had
all my powers? <br>
WORF: You have fooled us too often, Q. <br>
Q: Perspicacity incarnate. Please don't feel compelled now to tell me
the story of the boy who cried Worf. <br>
WORF: Computer, activate force field. <br>
Q: I demand to be let out of here, immediately. Do you hear me? You
will deactivate this cell immediately! Romulan! <br>
(Worf leaves) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: The question is, what sort of jaded game is
he up to this time? <br>
RIKER: Maybe he just wants a big laugh. He'll take Bre'el Four to the
edge of disaster, and then pull the moon back. <br>
PICARD: Or he may have nothing to do with it at all. <br>
RIKER: You honestly think Q is telling the truth? <br>
PICARD: Oh, I agree this is highly unlikely, but we have to proceed
with our current dilemma as though Q is powerless to prevent it, don't
we? <br>
RIKER: And there he sits, and he watches us struggle. <br>
PICARD: I don't see that we have any choice. Mister Worf, will you hail
the Bre'el Four science station, <br>
WORF [OC]: They're standing by, Captain. <br>
GARIN [on monitor]: Yes, Captain Picard. <br>
PICARD: I'm sorry, but I have to report that our first attempt to
restore the moon to its proper orbit has failed. <br>
GARIN [on monitor]: We have less than twenty five hours before impact,
Captain. <br>
RIKER: Our Chief Engineer is working on ways to reinforce our tractor
beam. <br>
PICARD: So there is a hope, but if you have an evacuation plan <br>
GARIN [on monitor]: We have already started moving people from the
coastal areas of the western continent. <br>
PICARD: We are going to make another attempt shortly. Picard out. <br>
RIKER: I've got to tell you Geordi is not at all optimistic. <br>
(A bright light fills the room) <br>
PICARD: What the devil?

RIKER: Data? <br>
DATA: Sensors are showing broadband emissions, including Berthold rays <br>
RIKER: Lethal? <br>
DATA: No, Commander. Overall exposure is less than seventy five rems.
Very low intensity, more like a soft medical scan. I would speculate we
are being probed. <br>
PICARD: By whom? <br>

coming from all around us. </font></p>

Q: Ah, you've come to apologise. How nice. All's forgiven. No offense
taken. <br>
PICARD: Enough. Q, what exactly is going on. <br>
Q: Well, how can I know what's going on? I've been in this dungeon of
yours, alone, helpless, bored to tears. <br>
PICARD: We have a moon inexplicably falling out of orbit, and just now
this ship was probed with Berthold radiation. <br>
Q: I wasn't aware of this. Truthfully, Jean-Luc. I have been entirely
preoccupied by a most frightening experience of
my own. A couple of hours ago, I realising that my body was no longer
functioning properly. I felt weak. I could no longer stand. The life
was oozing out of me. I lost consciousness. <br>
PICARD: You fell asleep. <br>
Q: Terrifying. How can you stand it day after day? <br>
PICARD: You get used to it. <br>
Q: What other dangers await me? I'm not prepared for this. I need
guidance. <br>
PICARD: Q, I'm not going to play along with this. If you want to
continue this charade, you can do it alone. <br>
Q: Jean-Luc, wait! (walks into the forcefield) This is getting on my
nerves, now that I have them. You have a moon in a deteriorating orbit.
I've known moons through the universe. Big ones, small ones. I'm an
expert. I could help you with this one, if you let me out of here. <br>
PICARD: Q, there are millions of lives at risk. If you have the power
to <br>
Q: I don't have any powers. But I have the knowledge, locked up in this
puny brain. You cannot afford to not take that advantage, can you? <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, report to detention cell three. <br>
DATA [OC]: On my way, sir. <br>
PICARD: Computer, remove the forcefield. If you are human, which I
seriously doubt, you will have to work hard to earn our trust. <br>
Q: I'm not worried about that, Jean-Luc. You only dislike me. There are
others in the cosmos who truly despise me. <br>
(Data enters) <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, you are hereby assigned to Q for the remainder of
his stay. You will escort him to Mister La Forge in Engineering. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir. <br>
(Picard leaves) <br>
Q: Can I have a Starfleet uniform? What are you looking at? <br>
DATA: I was considering the possibility that you are telling the truth,
that you really are human. <br>
Q: It's the ghastly truth, Mister Data. I can now stub my toe with the
best of them. <br>
DATA: An irony. It means that you have achieved in disgrace what I have
always aspired to be.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Q: Humans are such commonplace little creatures.
They roam the galaxy looking for something, they know not what. <br>
DATA: The human race has an enduring desire for knowledge, and for new
opportunities to improve itself. <br>
Q: There's certainly room for improvement, but the truth is, Data, they
are a minor species in the grand scheme. Not worth your envy. <br>
DATA: Oh, I do not feel envy. <br>
Q: Well, that's good. <br>
DATA: I feel nothing at all. That is part of my dilemma. I have the
curiosity of humans, but there are questions I will never have the
answer to. What is it like to laugh, or cry, or to experience any human
emotions. <br>
Q: Well, if you ask me, these human emotions are not what they're
cracked up to be.

it for nearly seven hours and I think that just might do it. But,
there's a problem. <br>

Q: This is obviously the result of a large celestial object passing
through at near right angles to the plane of the star system. Probably
a black hole. <br>
DATA: Can you recommend a way to counter the effect? <br>
Q: Simple. Change the gravitational constant of the universe. <br>
LAFORGE: What? <br>
Q: Change the gravitational constant of the universe, thereby altering
the mass of the asteroid. <br>
LAFORGE: Redefine gravity? How am I supposed to do that? <br>
Q: You just do it. Where's that Doctor, anyway? <br>
DATA: Geordi is trying to say that changing the gravitational constant
of the universe is beyond our capabilities. <br>
Q: Oh. In that case, never mind. <br>
(Crusher enters) <br>
Q: Ah, Doctor Crusher. I see Starfleet has shipped you back into exile.
<br>
DATA: Q says he has hurt his back. <br>
CRUSHER: Ah ha. Well, if I didn't see it with my own eyes, I wouldn't
believe it. According to this, he has classic back trauma. Muscle
spasms. <br>
Q: I've been under a lot of pressure lately. Family problems. <br>
CRUSHER: Well. don't expect too much sympathy from me. You've been a
pain in our backside often enough. <br>
Q: Your bedside manner is admirable, Doctor. I'm sure your patients
recover quickly just to get away from you. <br>
LAFORGE: You know, this might work. We can't change the gravitational
constant of the universe, but if we wrap a low level warp field around
that moon, we could reduce its gravitational constant. Make it lighter
so we can push it. <br>
Q: Glad I could help. Ow. I think. <br>

Q: Oh, I take it back. You do have a sense of humour. A dreadful one at
that. <br>
RIKER: I'm serious. <br>
PICARD: Of course. You knew this would happen, didn't you? <br>
Q: One can never anticipate the Calamarain. They're very intelligent,
but very flighty. <br>
PICARD: Yes, but you must have so many enemies. Certainly you knew that
once you became mortal some of them might look you up. <br>
Q: It had occurred to me. <br>
PICARD: And for all your protestations of friendship, your real reason
for being here is protection. <br>
Q: You're very smart, Jean-Luc, but I know human beings. They're all
sopping over with compassion and forgiveness. They can't wait to
absolve almost any offence. It's an inherent weakness in the breed. <br>
PICARD: On the contrary, it is a strength. <br>
Q: You call it what you will, but I think you'll protect me even though
I've tortured you now and again. <br>
RIKER: Fighting off all the species you've insulted would be a full
time mission. That's not the one I signed up for. <br>
PICARD: Indeed. Human or not, I want no part of you. We will deposit
you at the first starbase. Let them deal with you. <br>
Q: But I could be a valuable member of the team. I'm human, I can
learn. <br>
