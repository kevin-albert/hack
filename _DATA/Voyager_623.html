<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lit by torches, a Greek Chorus is declaiming their part of the play for their rapt audience.)<br>CHORUS:
Captain's log, stardate 53896. B'Elanna Torres has requested permission
to take the Delta Flyer and search for dilithium. Shining Voyager, far
from home, far from the gleaming cities of Earth. <br>
KELIS: Headstrong B'Elanna Torres, and young Harry Kim, speed away from
Voyager on the Delta Flyer in search of their treasures. <br>(The
principals hold masks in front of their faces that represent the
characters. Yes, the Torres one does have a ridged forehead.)<br>
JERO: I've trimmed the sails but the sea is rough. Maybe we should
return.<br>
LAYNA: I know what I'm doing.<br>
CHORUS: A wave as high as a mountain struck the Delta Flyer.<br>
LAYNA: Get into the escape pod.<br>
JERO: We die together.<br>
LAYNA: No one is going to die. Go.<br>
CHORUS: Young Harry Kim left her side and B'Elanna Torres was thrown
against the rocks, the rocks of our very shore.<br>
KELIS: Which is where I, Kelis the poet, found her. Broken, dying. She
told me her story, and now I've told you. <br>(Everyone waits with bated breath for one man to applaud. When he does, they join in enthusiastically.)<br>
AUTARCH: An excellent conceit, that you discovered her yourself. <br>
KELIS: Thank you.<br>
AUTARCH: Well, now that B'Elanna Torres has come to our shore, what
will happen? Does Captain Janeway come searching for her, or does she
give her up for lost? <br>
KELIS: Who can say?<br>
AUTARCH: Well, I would hope that you can. I want to see more of these
Voyager Eternals.<br>
KELIS: Inspiration can't be forced.<br>
AUTARCH: One week.<br>
KELIS: Or three weeks. Maybe two. One week. The story will continue.
Have you noticed how thin my performers have gotten?<br>
AUTARCH: Let them eat this. <br>(He throws Kelis a jewel that was hanging around his consort's neck.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KELIS:
Ladies and gentlemen, our patron salutes you. <br>
JERO: Finally!<br>
KELIS: We're doing another Voyager play. As soon as I can write it. <br>
LAYNA: Shall we celebrate, the two of us?<br>
KELIS: I have very little time. Celebrating will have to wait.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The Flyer has crashed on a
mountainside. Candles illuminate the inside. Torres is in the pilot's
seat and her hands are tied. Kelis reaches forward with his knife to
cut her bonds, and she hits him.)<br>TORRES:
Who are you?<br>
KELIS: Kelis, Kelis the poet. Your servant.<br>
TORRES: My servant? All right. Let me go.<br>
KELIS: I can't. <br>
TORRES: Why not?<br>
KELIS: You'll fly from me, the way inspiration always does.<br>
TORRES: You're trying to kill me. <br>(There are cuts on her forearm.)<br>
KELIS: I'm releasing the heat from your veins. <br>
TORRES: What are you talking about?<br>
KELIS: You've been in a fever since I found you. Bleeding is the best
way to treat it.<br>
TORRES: Oh, I can see I'm in good hands.<br>
KELIS: Something tells me you have your doubts. <br>
TORRES: There's a medkit over there. A box, made out of metal. There's
a small cylinder inside. Bring it here. Give it to me. <br>(Kelis does. She turns it on.)<br>TORRES: Don't be afraid,
it won't hurt you. Here. Pass it over where you cut me. <br>(The dermal regenerator heals the cuts.)<br>
KELIS: You're an Eternal. I suppose such things are to be expected.<br>
TORRES: What other things do you expect from an Eternal? <br>
KELIS: The power to make the ground open up and the sky to fall. All
the strange events sung by the ancient poets. Fortunately for me, no
poet has ever sung about your clan. I'm the first. <br>
TORRES: My clan?<br>
KELIS: The Eternals on Voyager. Shining Voyager, far from home.<br>
TORRES: What do you know about that? <br>
TORRES [OC]: Delta Flyer log, stardate 53918. Harry and I are
continuing toward the fourth planet. Sensors have picked up natural
dilithium deposits on nearly every land mass. <br>(Fast forward.)<br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Acknowledged. Has your warp core been damaged? <br>
TORRES [OC]: Yes. We're running on thrusters. Can you track our
position? <br>
TORRES: How long have I been here? <br>
KELIS: Eight days. I was walking through these mountains. I saw a light
burn across the sky and I heard a terrible sound. When I arrived, I
found you. I treated your wounds. <br>
TORRES: And you tied me to this chair. <br>
KELIS: When a gift falls from the heavens, only a fool would let her
go. You've already given me one play. The story told by those voices. I
pieced them together, tried to fill in the gaps.<br>
TORRES: You made a play out of our logs?<br>
KELIS: The Away Mission of B'Elanna Torres. My patron was impressed.<br>
TORRES: He has great taste. Now take that knife of yours and cut me
free.<br>
KELIS: That would be unwise.<br>
TORRES: Why? <br>
KELIS: My patron is intrigued by the Voyager Eternals. He wants another
play. To compose that, I need more details. <br>
TORRES: And you expect to get them from me?<br>
KELIS: I did save your life.<br>
TORRES: I need to get back to Voyager.<br>
KELIS: I need another play. <br>
TORRES: What exactly do you want to know?<br>
KELIS: Everything. <br>
TORRES: It's not possible. We Eternals have our rules. We can't just
give everything away. <br>
KELIS: How did you get lost?<br>
TORRES: Cut me free and I'll tell you.<br>
KELIS: You won't leave me?<br>
TORRES: Cut me free. <br>(Kelis cuts the ropes. Torres picks up a phaser.) <br>TORRES: You're the one who's leaving.
<br>(She fires the phaser at a tree branch, vaporising it.) <br>TORRES: Don't come back. </font></p>

COMPUTER: Unable to comply. <br>
TORRES: Why not? <br>
COMPUTER: Insufficient power. <br>(She goes to another console, but)<br>
TORRES: Great. Now there's no power. <br>
KELIS: Are you hungry? <br>
TORRES: I told you not to come back. <br>
KELIS: You haven't eaten in days. We have to support each other, we
poets. <br>(Torres takes the proffered berries.)<br>
TORRES: I'm an engineer. I fix things. <br>
KELIS: From the looks of it, you're not doing so well. <br>
TORRES: Are you a poet or a critic?<br>
KELIS: Tell me about Earth. <br>
TORRES: I have to sing for my supper, huh?<br>
KELIS: We all do, in one way or another. Earth. <br>(He offers her his bag of food.)<br>
TORRES: It's a, an island. A beautiful island, blue and green.<br>
KELIS: And Voyager, a great ship? <br>
TORRES: In a long line of great ships. <br>
KELIS: How did Voyager get lost? <br>
TORRES: The Caretaker. <br>
KELIS: An Eternal? <br>
TORRES: Yes, you could say that. He caused a storm, which blew us
off course. <br>
KELIS: Tom Paris. Are you in love with him? <br>

This is where we put all the names and

KELIS: A memory.<br>
TORRES: Exactly. Tell me, have you ever seen this before? <br>(She calls up an image of a crystalline structure.)<br>
KELIS: Winter's tears. <br>
TORRES: Can you get me some?<br>
KELIS: This is dilithium, isn't it? What you were looking for? <br>
TORRES: Where can I find it?<br>
KELIS: The only deposit I know of is on the hunting grounds of my
patron. He'd execute me for trespassing. And you, well, he'd love to
capture an Eternal.<br>
TORRES: Maybe I'm more powerful than he is. <br>
KELIS: Perhaps, but if he caught you he'd force you to fight against
his enemies. They're constantly at each other's throats. Bickering over
territory, raiding each other's land, starting wars whenever they can
be guaranteed of good weather. And we suffer the consequences. You
don't want to get involved with them. <br>
TORRES: Which is why you're going to get the dilithium.<br>
KELIS: I told you, I'd be executed if I'm caught. <br>
TORRES: The dilithium. Or I don't say another word about Shining
Voyager, far from home. <br>(A thunderstorm breaks overhead.) <br>

can't blame my performers. These Eternals on Voyager are difficult to
understand. <br>
TORRES: Will you stop walking around? You're going to break something. <br>
KELIS: This Tuvok, for example. He's not like anybody I've ever met. No
emotions? How is that possible? <br>

KELIS: What happened?<br>
TORRES: I don't know. The transmitter must have been weakened in the
crash. It couldn't take the energy surge.<br>
KELIS: These Vulcans. <br>
TORRES: Enough! What kind of metallurgic technology do you people have?
Alloys. Which ones can you make? Steel? Bronze?<br>
KELIS: Bronze. <br>
TORRES: Bronze, all right. I need a plate of metal this big, as thin as
it can be, three parts tin to five parts bronze. One side coated with
gold. <br>
KELIS: Gold is expensive. I can't afford it.<br>
TORRES: Then you're going into debt. <br>

NEELIX: Don't you think you should go to bed?<br>
TUVOK: As a Vulcan, I can function without sleep for more than two
weeks.<br>
NEELIX: But there's a point of diminishing returns, when your mind
starts to play tricks on you.<br>
TUVOK: My mind, Mister Neelix, does not play tricks. <br>

JERO: Yes. <br>
KELIS: Logical Tuvok doesn't cry. That's why they call him Logical.<br>

very quiet place. Calm, just like Tuvok.<br>
JERO: I can't believe that.<br>
KELIS: You don't have to, just don't cry.<br>
JERO: The audience won't believe it either. They'll either think Tuvok
is an unfeeling monster, or that I am a bad performer.<br>
KELIS: They'll realise that beneath your unfeeling exterior is a heart
that's breaking, silently, and in more pain than any of us can possibly
understand, because that's what it is to be Vulcan. Try it again.<br>

He'll want to take revenge. It could lead to war. <br>

KELIS: I'm not asking you to fight. I need a way to change his mind.<br>

from violent thoughts. The perfect play might even stop a war. <br>

impurities. It'll never carry a plasma charge.<br>

The Rescue of B'Elanna Torres. We begin with Harry Kim reaching Voyager
in the escape pod. He tells Captain Janeway that B'Elanna Torres is
lost. We continue to the point where they discover a piece of the Delta
Flyer. After that <br>
TORRES: It's simple. They search for B'Elanna Torres. B'Elanna Torres
is found. <br>
KELIS: Or not found. <br>
TORRES: Or not found. The end. It sounds pretty straightforward to me.<br>
KELIS: That's exactly the problem. Where is the mistaken identity, the
discovery, the sudden reversal? Mistaken identity, a character who is
someone else. Discovery, the moment when that identity is revealed.
Reversal, a situation that turns from good to bad in a blink of an eye.
<br>
CHORUS 1: Find the truth of your story and you won't need all those
tricks. I don't know how things are done across the Eastern Sea, but
here poets have become lazy. They rely on manipulation to move their
audience. It wasn't always that way. Welcome. <br>
TORRES: Thank you. <br>
KELIS: The truth of my story. It's an old-fashioned idea. Today,
audiences want excitement, passion. Let me show you what I've done with

TORRES [OC]: The primary controls are offline. I've ordered Harry to
eject. I still have thrusters. I'm setting a course for an L class
planet. I'll try to maintain contact.<br>

TORRES: Captain Janeway kissing Commander Chakotay? Tom Paris kissing
Seven of Nine? I don't see the point.<br>
KELIS: Anger is like fire. Love can be the rain that extinguishes it.
My patron is filled with hatred for his rival, so our play should be
filled with love.<br>
TORRES: You can't change somebody's way of life with a few lines of
dialogue.<br>
KELIS: Yes, you can. It's been done before. Do you know what this place
used to be a hundred years ago? A temple, and this was the altar stone.
Every year a victim would be sacrificed on it in honour of winter. And
then one year, nobody remembers exactly when or why, a play took the
place of the ritual, and no one had to die here again. Why can't my play
take the place of a war? <br>
TORRES: Well, you're going to have to do a lot better than Harry Kim
kissing the Delaney sisters.<br>
KELIS: Why?<br>
TORRES: Because when you think that you are surrounded by enemies, when
you're up against the Borg, or, or Species 8472, the last thing on your
mind is romance. <br>
KELIS: You're an Eternal. You have to help me.<br>
TORRES: I'm sorry, Kelis.<br>
KELIS: The Borg. Tell me more about them.<br>
TORRES: They're soldiers, part of a vast army. They all think the same
thoughts, and they travel on ships that look like hives. <br>
KELIS: Like insect colonies. <br>
TORRES: They even have a queen.<br>
KELIS: That sounds terrifying. Captain Janeway hasn't been able to
destroy them<br>
TORRES: She is a Starfleet officer, trained to avoid violence whenever
possible. She would make peace with the Borg if she could.<br>
KELIS: This is what I need. An enemy, someone to stand in the way of
Voyager finding B'Elanna Torres. Captain Janeway, driven by vengeance,
must seek out the Queen of the Borg. The audience thinks she plans to
destroy them all, but <br>
TORRES: Go on. <br>
KELIS: The Sudden Reversal. Captain Janeway, holding her spear at the
queen's throat, throws her weapon aside and she argues passionately to
put an end to their conflict in words no one will fail to understand.<br>
TORRES: Including your patron? It's much better than all that
kissing. <br>
KELIS: Stay and help me. I still need an ending.<br>

CHORUS 1: It doesn't make sense. <br>
KELIS: It'll have to. Go, go.&nbsp;<br>
CHORUS 1 [OC]: Who are the enemies of Voyager? The Borg. <br>
CHORUS 2 [OC]: Species 8472. <br>(Two young men are sitting making copies of the play. Kelis speaks to one of them.)<br>
KELIS:&nbsp;You know where the ridge ends just below the peak?
Run there as fast as you can. You'll find a vessel wrecked against the
rocks. Go inside and give this to our friend. Don't be frightened. Go.

TUVOK: As you were. Bridge to Chakotay. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Go ahead. <br>
TUVOK: Request permission to be relieved.<br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Understood. I'll be right there. <br>
TUVOK: We're picking up a subspace transmission. Starfleet frequency.<br>
PARIS: It's a little rough. Hang on.<br>
TORRES [OC]: Delta Flyer. Harry and I are all right. We're on an L
class planet. Propulsion is down. <br>
TUVOK: Origin? <br>
PARIS: Five point two light years, F type star, looks like the fourth
planet.<br>

Seven of Nine.<br>
LAYNA: Captain.<br>
TANIS: The Delta Flyer has been found in pieces, on a rocky shore.<br>
LAYNA: And B'Elanna Torres? <br>
TANIS: No sign of her. Seven of Nine, you are my eyes and my ears. If
anyone can find her, it is you.<br>
LAYNA: (to audience) Her eyes and her ears. And the viper in her nest.
I, Seven of Nine, have no intention of finding B'Elanna Torres. I,
Seven of Nine, am Queen of the Borg. Surprised? No one will be more
surprised than Janeway when I take my revenge on Voyager. Say nothing
or you, too, will be assimilated. (to&nbsp;Janeway) Captain, I will
comply. (exits)<br>
TANIS: My enemies are everywhere without and within. Seven of Nine is
Queen of the Borg. Surprised? So was I. Tell her nothing, or I will
lose my advantage, and my ship as well.

[OC]: Are you okay? <br>
TORRES: Yes. <br>
KIM: We're fine. <br>

TORRES: Don't be afraid. <br>(He hands over the message and runs.) <br>
KIM: What is it?<br>
TORRES: Without inspiration, B'Elanna Torres will perish. He's
threatening to kill off B'Elanna as the climax to his play. <br>
KIM: Let him. <br>
TORRES: That means that he still can't figure out the ending. <br>
KIM: Who cares? <br>
TORRES: I do. <br>
KIM: You're serious?<br>
TORRES: Harry, have you ever inspired anybody? <br>
KIM: That's kind of a strange question.<br>
TORRES: It's been a strange couple of weeks. He needs me, or he's the
one who's going to die on that stage.<br>
KIM: What are you talking about? <br>

My death is irrelevant. You will never see the gleaming cities of
Earth. You will be assimilated.<br>
TANIS: And if I let you live?<br>
LAYNA: Also irrelevant.<br>
TANIS: You don't believe that. (Janeway throws down the spear.)<br>TANIS: The battle is over. Go home. <br>
LAYNA: How foolish of you to let me go, free to attack you again. <br>

destroyed. Until everything we value is gone, and there is nothing left

Finally, Voyager has reached our shores.<br>
TORRES: And not a moment too soon. Kelis the poet must say goodbye as
B'Elanna Torres returns to the Eternals in a dazzling blaze of light.<br>
CHORUS 3: On a far-away, snow-covered peak. <br>
TORRES: No, right here before your eyes. <br>
LAYNA: Wait! She's not from across the Eastern Sea. She's an Eternal.
I'm telling you she's B'Elanna Torres. The real B'Elanna Torres! I saw
her ship. <br>
CHORUS 1: The lead actress, in a fit of jealousy, brands her rival an
Eternal. Our patron rises to his feet to stop the play. <br>
AUTARCH: Nicely done. I almost believed you. Continue. <br>
KELIS: Stay. <br>
TORRES: Voyager needs me.<br>
KELIS: So do I. <br>
TORRES: No, you don't. You have all that you need right here. <br>(Torres hands him her mask.)<br>
KELIS: I'll be inspired every time I think of you. <br>
TORRES: One to beam, to ascend to the heavens. <br>(Torres is beamed away.) <br>
CHORUS 1: And so ends the rescue of B'Elanna Torres. Half Klingon
B'Elanna Torres. Half human B'Elanna Torres, Chief Engineer.<br>
KELIS: These stories will continue for as long as we have the breath to
tell them. And as long as our patrons remain wise and compassionate.
And Voyager will continue on her journey to the gleaming cities of
Earth, where peace reigns and hatred has no home. </font> </p>
