but we must attempt to contain the information I'm about to reveal to
you at least as long as possible. <br>
PICARD: I must admit you've piqued my curiosity, Admiral.<br>
BRACKETT: Three weeks ago, one of our most celebrated Ambassadors, an
advisor to Federation leaders for generations, disappeared. He left no
word of his destination. Two days ago, intelligence reports placed him
on Romulus and I assure you it was an unauthorised visit. Computer,
initiate linkage between this terminal and starbase computer system
alpha two nine.<br>
COMPUTER: Linkage complete.<br>
PICARD: A defection?<br>
BRACKETT: If it is, the damage to Federation security would be
immeasurable. Taken on Romulus, by long range scanner. Computer,

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 45236.4. As I study the
intelligence reports on Ambassador Spock's disappearance, I cannot help
but
feel a deeper, more personal concern about this mission, for I know
this man through his father. It was barely a year ago
that I shared a mind meld with the Vulcan, Sarek. Now we must meet
again as I attempt to find an explanation for his son's actions.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: We'll be coming into orbit of Vulcan in less
than an hour, Captain. <br>
PICARD: We should tell Sarek's wife of our plans. <br>
RIKER: Already been taken care of. She's transporting over at oh seven
hundred. <br>
PICARD: And Sarek?<br>
RIKER: She says he's too ill to make the trip. <br>
PICARD: The man is dying. And it's my honour to tell him that his son
may have betrayed the Federation.<br>
RIKER: How well do you know Spock? <br>
PICARD: I met him once. What I know of him comes from history books,
and of course my mind meld with his father. <br>
RIKER: That must cover a lot of ground. <br>
PICARD: Not as much as you'd imagine. Sarek and Spock. Well, sometimes,
fathers and sons. <br>
RIKER: Understood.<br>
PICARD: Oh, one other thing. Take a look at this. Turned up during an
intelligence sweep. <br>
(Picard hands over a PADD) <br>
RIKER: Metal fragments. <br>
PICARD: What do you make of it?<br>
RIKER: Possibly disassembled components, identified as Vulcan,
recovered from a downed Ferengi vessel? <br>
PICARD: They were found in crates marked Medical Supplies.<br>
RIKER: Contraband. <br>
PICARD: It's been sent to Vulcan for identification. Starfleet have
requested that we lend a hand. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ready room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PERRIN: Mint tea. It's been years since I've had
it. Vulcans have some kind of strange concoction they call mint. You'd
never recognise it.<br>
PICARD: Perrin, do you know why I've come to Vulcan? I must talk to you
about Spock.<br>
PERRIN: He didn't even say goodbye to his father before he left.<br>
PICARD: Is it possible he could have been abducted?<br>
PERRIN: No. He wrapped up all of his affairs carefully. He knew he was
going.<br>
PICARD: Do you have any idea why he might have disappeared like this?<br>
PERRIN: Captain, as far as I'm concerned, he disappeared a long time
ago. <br>
PICARD: Would it be inappropriate to ask what happened between you and
Spock?<br>
PERRIN: Not between us. Between Spock and his father. They had argued
for years. That was family. But when the debates over the Cardassian
war began, he attacked Sarek's position publicly. He showed no loyalty
to his father.<br>
PICARD: I was not aware that Sarek was offended by Spock's opposition.<br>
PERRIN: I was offended. I made sure Spock knew it. I'm very protective
of my husband. I do not apologise for it.<br>
PICARD: Does Sarek have any idea why Spock might have left?<br>
PERRIN: I don't know. If you could see Sarek as I do, wasting in bed,
whispering to himself. He wants to see his son. He wants to heal
any rift that may still remain. Now, it may be too late.<br>
PICARD: Perrin, would you allow me to see Sarek? <br>
PERRIN: If it were anyone else I would never permit it, but you are a
part of him and he of you.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(bits of twisted metal all over the place) <br>
RIKER: The Vulcans haven't figure out what these fragments are but
they've determined that the metal is a dentarium alloy.<br>
LAFORGE: That pretty well indicates that they're Vulcan. And dentarium
also means that whatever this was, it was originally designed
for use in space. From the look of the damage, it must've been a high
speed impact.<br>
RIKER: Yeah. A Ferengi cargo ship that went down in the Hanolin
asteroid belt. The debris was spread over a hundred square kilometres. <br>
LAFORGE: Could it be a weapons array?<br>
RIKER: That was my first thought, but the Vulcans have no record of any
stolen weapons or stolen parts, for that matter.<br>
LAFORGE: This is going to be like putting together a big jigsaw puzzle
when you don't know even know what the picture's supposed to be. <br>
RIKER: Yep. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(on a hard, flat bed, an elderly man with dementia
writhes and moans to himself) <br>
PERRIN: He is like this most of the time. His emotions have taken over.
Sometimes, I can bring him out of it. Sarek! You will listen!<br>
SAREK: Go from me!<br>
PERRIN: Picard is here.<br>
SAREK: No more chaos! No more. <br>
PERRIN: I will leave you alone with him. He will either acknowledge you
or he won't.<br>
(Perrin leaves) <br>
PICARD: Sarek! I've come a long way to see you.<br>
SAREK: I will not answer! <br>
PICARD: I must speak to you about your son. <br>
SAREK: I wish no one with me. <br>
PICARD: About Spock.<br>
SAREK: Spock?<br>
PICARD: Yes. He's missing.<br>
SAREK: Is that you, Picard?<br>
PICARD: Hello, old friend.<br>
SAREK: You're here, on Vulcan.<br>
PICARD: I need your help. I must find Spock.<br>
SAREK: He's not here.<br>
PICARD: I know. He's been reported on Romulus.<br>
SAREK: On Romulus? <br>
PICARD: Yes. <br>
SAREK: why?<br>
PICARD: I had hoped to find that out from you.<br>
SAREK: On Romulus? You're going there, aren't you? To find him.<br>
(Sarek gets out of bed) <br>
PICARD: Yes. Do you have any idea what might have taken him to Romulus?<br>
SAREK: No.<br>
PICARD: Is there anyone on Romulus he might know, or choose to contact?<br>
SAREK: Pardek? <br>
PICARD: Who is Pardek?<br>
SAREK: It could be Pardek.<br>
PICARD: Who is Pardek?<br>
SAREK: He is a Romulan Senator. Spock has maintained a relationship
with him over the years. I don't know how they met. At the Khitomer
Conference, I'd imagine.<br>
PICARD: Pardek represented Romulus?<br>
SAREK: Yes, I'm sure he did. In fact, I recall Spock coming to me with
optimism about a continuing dialogue with the Romulans. I told him it
was illogical to maintain such an expectation. Spock was always so
impressionable. This Romulan, Pardek, had no support at home. Of
course, in the end I was proven correct. I gave Spock the benefit of
experience, of logic. He never listened. Never listened.<br>
PICARD: It's been suggested that Spock might have defected.<br>
SAREK: Never! I will accept many things, but never that.<br>
PICARD: But you believe he might have gone there to see Pardek? <br>
SAREK: The Romulan Senator? How do you know Pardek?<br>
PICARD: I've heard of him.<br>
SAREK: That's what he's done. He's gone to see Pardek.<br>
PICARD: Do you know what business they might have together?<br>
SAREK: No. I never knew what Spock was doing. When he was a boy, he
would disappear for days into the mountains.
I asked him where he had gone, what he had done, he refused to tell me.
I insisted that he tell me. He would not. I forbade
him to go. He ignored me. I punished him. He endured it, silently. But
always he returned to the mountains. One might as well ask the river
not to run. (lies down again) But secretly I admired him, the proud
core of him that would not yield. <br>
PICARD: Sarek, we're a part of each other. I know that he has caused
you pain but I also know that you love him.<br>
SAREK: Tell him, Picard. <br>
(Sarek tries to make the hand signal, but Picard has to put his fingers
into the correct positions) <br>
PICARD: Peace and long life.<br>
SAREK: Live long and and. Live long and. Spock. My son.<br>
PICARD: And prosper.

Worf?<br>
WORF: No, sir.<br>
PICARD: He's ignoring me. What other explanation is there?<br>
RIKER: Seems after hailing him for three days, he could've found a
minute to talk to you.<br>
WORF: Sir.<br>
PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant?<br>
WORF: I believe I know why our messages are not being answered. Gowron
has been rewriting Klingon history.<br>
RIKER: Rewriting history?<br>
WORF: Yes. He is claiming it was his courage, his genius, which brought
an end to the civil war.<br>
PICARD: I see.<br>
WORF: In the new version there is no mention made of the Federation's
help in his rise to power.<br>
RIKER: If Worf's right, then our arrival would be an uncomfortable
reminder of the facts.<br>
PICARD: He can take all the credit he wants, I don't caret. But I do
need a ship.
Well if Gowron won't talk to me, get someone who will. Somebody on the
High Council. K'Tal, perhaps.<br>
WORF: Yes, sir.<br>
(at the science station) <br>
DATA: Captain, I have a visual identification of Senator Pardek of
Romulus. This is a Barolian record of a trade negotiation in which
Pardek participated four years ago.<br>
PICARD: That's all?<br>
DATA: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: Run it again. Computer, freeze. Call up the intelligence scan
of Spock on Romulus. Computer, enhance far left figure and compare.
Same man. Pardek. One question answered. What do we know of him?<br>
DATA: He has been in public service since he was a young man, a senator
for nine decades. He is considered a man of the
people. He has sponsored many reforms. Reportedly, Romulan leadership
considers him to be somewhat of a radical because he has been an
advocate of peace throughout his career.<br>
PICARD: I can see why Spock would cultivate a relationship with him.
Where would we find him other than on the floor of the Romulan Senate?<br>
DATA: The district he represents is called the Krocton segment. He
maintains a dwelling there.<br>
PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data.<br>
DATA: There is more, sir. I have taken the liberty of expanding the
parameters of my search, and have discovered that Pardek has
several relatives in the Krocton segment. I believe you will be able to
locate him there on the third day of the Romulan week when the Senate
is not in session.<br>
PICARD: Mister Data, your resourcefulness never ceases to amaze me.<br>
DATA: Thank you, sir.<br>
WORF: Captain, we are being hailed by the Klingon home world.<br>
PICARD: Gowron or K'Tal?<br>
WORF: Neither, sir. It is the junior adjutant to the diplomatic
delegation.<br>
RIKER: Junior adjutant.<br>
PICARD: Name.<br>
WORF: B'iJik, sir.<br>
PICARD: On screen.<br>
B'IJIK [on viewscreen]: Greetings, Captain. I regret to inform you that
Gowron and the High Council are quite busy and won't be able to speak
with you today.<br>
PICARD: Is Gowron aware that we have been transmitting messages for the
past three days?<br>
B'IJIK [on viewscreen]: Captain, Gowron wishes it were possible to talk
with everyone who wants an audience. But he is one man. The demands on
his time are formidable. If you would like me to take him a message. <br>
PICARD: A message? Very well. Tell Gowron, leader of the High Council
of the Klingon Empire, that his Arbiter of Succession, Jean-Luc Picard,
needs a favour.<br>
B'IJIK [on viewscreen]: A favour?<br>
PICARD: I require a cloaked vessel.<br>
B'IJIK [on viewscreen]: A cloaked vessel. This is no small favour,
Captain.<br>
PICARD: It is for a mission that could have repercussions throughout
the quadrant.<br>
B'IJIK [on viewscreen]: How would it benefit the Klingon Empire? I'm
sure Gowron will ask.<br>
PICARD: The only benefit to the Klingon Empire would be our gratitude.<br>
B'IJIK [on viewscreen]: That is what you want me to tell him? <br>
PICARD: Yes. And please add that if he is unable to provide a ship,
then I am sure there are others in the Klingon Empire who would be
willing to help me. And then, they would have our gratitude.<br>
B'IJIK [on viewscreen]: I see.<br>
PICARD: Also, please tell him that I am immensely gratified that he is
prospering so well. A tribute to his skilled leadership. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: These quarters were obviously intended for
one crewmember, sir. There is but a single sleeping space.<br>
PICARD: I'm sure the Klingons found it amusing to put us in here
together.<br>
DATA: Since I do not require sleep, I propose you take the shelf, sir.
I am content to stand.<br>
PICARD: Very well, Mister Data. Thank you.<br>
(Picard lies down on the metal shelf with a bulkhead only just above
his head) <br>
DATA: Are you comfortable, sir?<br>
PICARD: I suppose so.<br>
DATA: Good night, Captain. Sleep well, sir.<br>
PICARD: Thank you.<br>
PICARD: What are you doing?<br>
DATA: Sir? Was I making noise, sir?<br>
PICARD: No, not exactly <br>
DATA: I was processing all of the information we have accumulated on
Romulan society. I am preparing for the task of impersonating a Romulan.<br>
PICARD: I see.<br>
DATA: Would you like me to discontinue, sir?<br>
PICARD: No. Please go on.<br>
PICARD: What are you looking at?<br>
DATA: I am not looking at anything, sir. I am continuing to organise my
files.<br>
PICARD: But you're looking at me.<br>
DATA: I am sorry if I was disturbing you, sir. I will not look in your
direction.<br>
(Data turns around, Picard gives up and gets up) <br>
DATA: Do you not wish to sleep, sir?<br>
PICARD: I don't think so, Mister Data. Let's go on with the files. <br>
DATA: I would be happy to. I have been studying the Krocton segment, as
you asked, and have selected an appropriate site for our transport. <br>

that might interest you.<br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: Commander, sensors detect a ship approaching
at warp speed.<br>
RIKER: Identification?<br>
WORF: Negative. No transponder signal, no subspace marker. <br>
LAFORGE: Sounds like they don't want to be identified.<br>
WORF: The ship is coming out of warp, sir. <br>
RIKER: On screen.<br>
LAFORGE: Sensors indicate a combat vessel, origin undetermined, heavily
armed. Mass and density suggest that it's fully loaded with
cargo. I'd say from these internal scans, a good deal of that cargo is
weaponry.<br>
WORF: The ship is entering sector twelve delta four <br>
DOKACHIN: He's taking the position assigned to the Tripoli. The
coordinates are identical.<br>
LAFORGE: Commander, readings indicate surface to ship transport has
begun.<br>
RIKER: Mister La Forge, bring the engines back online and restore all
systems to normal.<br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.<br>
WORF: He's powering up engines, turning to starboard.<br>
RIKER: Open a channel.<br>
WORF: Open.<br>
RIKER: This is Commander William Riker of the USS Enterprise. Identify
yourself. I repeat, you have entered a Federation depot. Identify
yourself.<br>
WORF: Sir, the ship is locking phasers.<br>
RIKER: Shields up. Red alert.<br>
LAFORGE: That ship easily matches our armament, Commander.<br>
WORF: It's coming about.<br>
RIKER: If you do not respond to our hails, we will take that as
evidence of hostile action.<br>
WORF: There is an energy build up in their phaser banks. Sir, they're
activating weapons. <br>
(thump) <br>
WORF: Forward shields down to seventy two percent.<br>
RIKER: Boost power to the shields. <br>
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.<br>
RIKER: Mister Worf, lock onto their weapon systems only and prepare to
fire. <br>
(Enterprise takes more hits) <br>
WORF: Forward shields down to sixty eight percent, aft shields forty
percent.<br>
RIKER: On my mark, point seven five burst. We just want to get their
attention.<br>
WORF: Ready, sir.<br>
RIKER: Fire.<br>
WORF: Their forward shields are damaged, sir. <br>
LAFORGE: We destroyed one of their phaser arrays. Looks like collateral
damage in the cargo area. Commander, I'm picking up massive power
fluctuations, internal explosions. With all the armament that ship is
carrying, it's going to blow. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Well, Mister Data? What do you think?<br>
(They are both now Romulan) <br>
DATA: I would not have thought it possible, sir. I am eager to test the
success of our efforts. It does
remain to be seen if the Romulans will accept us. Captain, you have
seemed unusually pensive since we received the news of Ambassador
Sarek's death.<br>
PICARD: Sarek and I share a particular bond. Our lives touched in an
unusual way. I admit I feel the effects of his death. The tenor of this
mission has changed, Mister Data, at least it has for me. We were sent
to confront Spock about his disappearance. Now, I also have to tell him
that his father is dead.<br>
DATA: I do not entirely understand, sir. As a Vulcan, Ambassador Spock
would simply see death as the logical result of his father's illness. <br>
PICARD: It's never quite that simple, not even for a Vulcan. Certainly
not for Spock who is half-human. Years spent in conflict. And now the
chance to resolve all of those differences is gone.<br>
DATA: Considering the exceptionally long lifespan of Vulcans, it does
seem odd that Sarek and Spock did not choose to resolve those
differences in the time allowed.<br>
PICARD: Father and son. Both proud, both stubborn, more alike than
either of them were prepared to admit. A lifetime spent building
emotional barriers. They're very difficult to break down. And now the
time has come, it's too late. It's a difficult moment. It's a lonely
one. It's a moment Spock is about to face.

PARDEK: I got here as quickly as I could, Proconsul.<br>
NERAL: What do you know of this human? Jean-Luc Picard, a Starfleet
Captain. <br>
PARDEK: I know nothing of him.<br>
NERAL: You haven't seen him recently?<br>
PARDEK: To my knowledge, I have never seen him.<br>
NERAL: I have received intelligence indicating he's on his way here.
Perhaps here already.<br>
PARDEK: Here on Romulus?<br>
NERAL: Yes. Curious, isn't it. I suppose we'd better find out if the
report is accurate or merely rumour. Circulate his likeness among the
security forces. Remind them that if he is here, he's probably
disguised as one of us.<br>

optical distortions, I am able to verify the architectural features.<br>

well, android way.<br>
DATA: I am sorry, Captain. I will be more careful.<br>
PICARD: Don't call me Captain.<br>
DATA: I understand, sir. I have found the place where they were
standing. <br>
PICARD: Where?<br>
DATA: It is here, at this doorway. A legal intercessor's office. The
name is similar to Pardek's. It would appear to be one of his relatives.<br>

PICARD: He's not open for business yet. <br>
DATA: Nonetheless, I recommend we keep this location under observation.
I have clearly determined

invariably comes to this section after the median hour.<br>
