48693.2. We've altered course to investigate some unusually intense
photonic activity in a nearby protostar. Lieutenant Torres and I are
beaming aboard samples for further analysis. </font>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
Containment field is active. We're ready for transport.<br>
JANEWAY: Energise.<br>
(Glowing orange gas fills a container.) <br>
TORRES: That's strange. Both containers should have been filled.<br>
JANEWAY: Here's the problem. A slight breach in the annular confinement
beam.<br>
TORRES: I'm aborting transport. Okay, let's try that again. Energising.
<br>
(Both containers fill this time.) <br>
TORRES: All right. I'll get a complete phase spectrum analysis on this
as soon as possible.<br>
JANEWAY: If this photonic matter works as well as I think, it could
boost the efficiency of our power converters fifteen percent.<br>
TORRES: I'd say more like twenty.<br>
JANEWAY: How long will it take to finish the preliminary analysis?<br>
TORRES: Um, six hours. Maybe more.<br>
JANEWAY: I'd like to get it sooner than that. I believe Ensign Kim is
off duty. Could you use his help?<br>
TORRES: Can you convince him to give up his free time?<br>
JANEWAY: I think I might be able to. Janeway to Kim. That's odd.
Computer, locate Ensign Kim.<br>
COMPUTER: Unable to comply. Ensign Kim is not aboard the ship. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>
[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
Sensor logs show no record of any unauthorised transporter activity and
all shuttlecraft are accounted for. If Ensign Kim left the ship, he did
not do so by conventional means.<br>
CHAKOTAY: His last shift ended four hours ago, and he was scheduled for
time on holodeck two when he went off duty. No one has seen him since.<br>
JANEWAY: Scan the holodeck. What's the matter?<br>
TUVOK: There is significant interference in the holodeck. I cannot
obtain a clear scan.<br>
JANEWAY: Is it a system malfunction?<br>
TUVOK: I do not believe so.<br>
JANEWAY: Commander. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Outside
Holodeck two]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
The holodeck is definitely active. There appears to be a programme in
progress.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Can you shut it down?<br>
TUVOK: Manual overrides are not functioning. I cannot terminate the
programme.<br>
CHAKOTAY: All right, let's go in. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Holodeck
- Forest]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Night
time. Frogs are calling.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Computer, identify programme.<br>
COMPUTER: The programme in progress is a holonovel based on the epic
Earth poem Beowulf.<br>
TUVOK: Beowulf?<br>
CHAKOTAY: An ancient English epic, set in sixth century Denmark, if I
remember correctly. It's about a hero named Beowulf who fights a
creature that's terrorising a kingdom and murdering its subjects.
Monsters and swordplay. That sort of thing.<br>
TUVOK: I'm not detecting any life signs but there's still considerable
interference.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I can't determine the source. <br>
(A spear flies past and stick into a tree.) <br>
FREYA: Speak as a friend or stand challenged.<br>
TUVOK: Computer, delete character.<br>
CHAKOTAY: The holodeck command systems must not be functioning either.<br>
TUVOK: We must also consider the possibility that the safety programmes
are malfunctioning as well.<br>
FREYA: I am Freya, shield maiden, daughter of King Hrothgar. I hold
this guard post against any intruders who would bear us harm, so
declare yourselves. I will hear your answer before you march any
further through this land.<br>
TUVOK: We have no desire to trespass. However, we are on an urgent
mission, so if you would allow us to continue, we would appreciate it.<br>
FREYA: What land do you call home? Your faces tell me you are not men
of the Danes. Are you kinsmen of Beowulf?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes. We are Beowulf's kinsmen. My name is Chakotay and this
is Tuvok. Have you seen Beowulf?<br>
FREYA: Yes. He was like no other. Hair straight and raven black. Eyes
bright with fierce fire. The burning gaze of a hero.<br>
TUVOK: Grandiloquence notwithstanding, that would qualify as a
description of Mister Kim. How did you know he was Beowulf?<br>
CHAKOTAY: This is Harry's holonovel. It'd make sense that he'd be
playing the hero. She might be able to help us figure out what happened
to him.<br>
TUVOK: A reasonable assumption.<br>
FREYA: Your kinsman was a truly noble warrior. It is right you should
avenge his death.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes. But first we'd like to know more about how Beowulf died.<br>
FREYA: Of course. Come. I will take you to the king. </font></p>

[Holodeck - Great Hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (The
evening feast is in progress.) <br>
FREYA: Hail, Lord Hrothgar! I bring new friends, Chakotay and Tuvok,
kinsmen of Beowulf who come to avenge his death. Greet them well.<br>
HROTHGAR: I would bid you welcome to my hall, but the days of glad
tidings are gone from this place. We grieve with you for your kinsman.
We had hoped that a warrior of Beowulf 's strength and renown would be
able to deliver us from our curse.<br>
(Hrothgar is helped to his throne by Unferth.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Could you tell us exactly what happened to him?<br>
UNFERTH: He met with the same fate as did thirty of our own warriors.<br>
HROTHGAR: It's true. Grendel.<br>
CHAKOTAY: That's the monster who's been attacking you.<br>
HROTHGAR: Repelled by light and laughter, the beast waits until we
slumber. Then bereft of remorse, Grendel comes in murderous rage to my
hall to take my people, and there is nothing anyone can do to stop it.
If you are wise, you will forego your vengeance and return home. Death
lives here now.<br>
UNFERTH: My lord is fatigued. It is time to retire.<br>
TUVOK: We would like more information about Beowulf. Would it be
possible to examine his body?<br>
FREYA: The body of Beowulf is gone, dragged down to Grendel's foul
lair, no doubt. The beast leaves no traces.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Did anyone actually see the battle?<br>
FREYA: No. Beowulf chose to face Grendel alone.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Then I think we'd like to see this Grendel for ourselves.<br>
UNFERTH: To what purpose? To raise false hopes in our king again, as
did your kinsman? Leave us alone in our misery.<br>
FREYA: Unferth, these men are our guests. You will show them the
hospitality they deserve.<br>
UNFERTH: They deserve nothing! If their Beowulf was truly the champion
he claimed to be, then Grendel would be dead, his head mounted on a
spear! Instead, we spend yet another night in terror.<br>
TUVOK: If you would allow us to assist you, perhaps we could help
alleviate your terror.<br>
UNFERTH: Your names mean nothing to me. There are no songs of your
deeds nor stories of the battles you have fought. Who are you to
believe you can slay Grendel?<br>
TUVOK: We have no intention of slaying anyone. We simply wish to
examine the creature.<br>
UNFERTH: Grendel might not wish to be examined without a fight. And if
you would fight Grendel, then you will first prove your worth to me.
Defend yourselves!<br>
(Hrothgar puts his hand on Unferth's sword.) <br>
HROTHGAR: You are able warriors. You may stand sentry tonight.<br>
(The Danes leave.) <br>
FREYA: You are brave men. I hope to see you again, fate permitting. <br>
(Freya leaves.) <br>

and Torres are at the rear science stations.) <br>
JANEWAY: Go ahead.<br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Captain, we haven't found any definite signs of Harry,
but we've encountered several holodeck characters who claim to know
what happened to him.<br>
TUVOK [OC]: Mister Kim was running a holonovel based on the poem
Beowulf. According to the holo characters, he attempted to battle a
creature of some kind and was killed in the process.<br>
JANEWAY: Killed? <br>
TUVOK [OC]: Since the </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Holodeck

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
Safety programs are malfunctioning, we must consider the possibility.<br>
JANEWAY [OC]: But you haven't found a body.<br>
CHAKOTAY: No. If we shut down the programme, we'd know if he's here or
not. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>
[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Run a diagnostic on the holodeck's imaging control systems. If
they're not working, try to repair them. And relay your tricorder scans
to the Bridge. I'd like to analyse your readings.<br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Aye, Captain. Chakotay out. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Holodeck
- Great Hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
Primary imaging matrix should be here behind this wooden panel. I will
attempt to locate the auxiliary matrix. This ancient Earth culture
seems fascinated with monsters.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Every culture has its demons. They embody the darkest
emotions of its people. Giving them physical form in heroic literature
is a way of exploring those feelings. The Vok'sha of Rakella Prime
believe that hate is a beast which lives inside the stomach. Their
greatest mythical hero is a man who ate stones for twenty three days to
kill the beast and became a saint.<br>
TUVOK: Such fables are necessary only in cultures which unduly
emphasise emotional behaviour. I would point out there are no demons in
Vulcan literature.<br>
CHAKOTAY: That might account for its popularity.<br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Bridge to Chakotay.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay here. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Commander </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>
[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: We've analysed your tricorder data. A deep-level scan shows
minute quantities of photonic energy.<br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: How could it be in the holodeck?<br>
TORRES: We think it happened when we beamed aboard the samples from the
protostar. There was a breach in the annular confinement beam, and
photonic energy must have leaked into the transporter system.<br>
JANEWAY: And from there into other ship systems as well. We've already
found some in the replicators.<br>
TUVOK [OC]: That raises an uncomfortable possibility, Captain. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Holodeck
- Great Hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
If the holodeck's conversion nodes were contaminated, Ensign Kim may
have inadvertently undergone the process of matter conversion.<br>
CHAKOTAY: You're saying he might have been converted into energy? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>
[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: We have to consider it a possibility. After all, the holodeck
are basically an outgrowth of transporter technology, changing energy
into matter and back again every time a programme is run.<br>
TORRES: Except it's not supposed to convert people.<br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Hold on, Captain. </font></p>

CHAKOTAY: Something's coming.<br>
TUVOK: It is an object approximately one metre in diameter.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I think Grendel may be paying us a visit.<br>
TUVOK: Captain, the holo-characters told us Kim was killed by Grendel.
An examination of this part of the programme might be advisable.<br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Proceed. </font></p>

Captain, I'm picking up signs of matter energy conversion.<br>
JANEWAY: Emergency transport. Get them out of there now.<br>
TORRES: I can't get a lock. <br>
(A bright light forces open the door to the Great Hall.) <br>
JANEWAY: Commander Chakotay, report. Mister Tuvok.<br>
TORRES: Captain, I've lost their life signs. They're gone. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Briefing
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
This is a scan of the holodeck just before we lost contact with
Chakotay and Tuvok. The readings are pretty garbled, but I'm still
inclined to think there is a malfunction in the holodeck's matter
conversion nodes.<br>
JANEWAY: Photonic energy leaking into the subsystems could certainly
damage the nodes, and it might have created a defect in the programme
that occurs when Grendel shows up.<br>
TORRES: A defect that dematerialised our people.<br>
PARIS:: I'm not willing to accept the fact that Harry and the others
are gone for good. Their molecular patterns might still be there. And
if they are, we might be able to rematerialise them. The only thing we
can do is go back into the holodeck, study this energy surge, find out
what exactly happened.<br>
TORRES: Anyone who goes back in there might wind up just like the
others.<br>
PARIS: Maybe not anyone. </font></p>

PARIS: A hologram can't be converted into energy. It already is energy.
You're the perfect choice.<br>
EMH: How do you intend to transfer me out of Sickbay?<br>
JANEWAY: We'll have to modify your data stream protocols and imaging
systems. But the fact that you're going to the holodeck simplifies
things. The projection systems are already in place there.<br>
TORRES: And we're going to give you complete control over your magnetic
containment field. You'll be able to make yourself solid or let matter
pass through you at will.<br>
JANEWAY: Nothing on the holodeck will be able to touch you unless you
want it to.<br>
EMH: I see.<br>
JANEWAY: Think of this as your first away mission, Doctor. I can
understand your hesitation. But there are three lives at stake, and you
have the best chance of anyone on this ship to save them. Do you
understand that?<br>
EMH: Yes.<br>
JANEWAY: Good. Your job is to find the photonic energy surge and scan
it closely. We need all the data we can get. You'll have to interact
with the characters in the holonovel, so make sure you're familiar with
the Beowulf story. Your circuit modifications will be finished in three
hours.<br>
EMH: Yes, Captain. <br>

absence is no reason to suspend your studies. How are you doing with
the protein synthesis text?<br>
KES: I finished it yesterday.<br>
EMH: Good. Then you may as well start learning how to operate the
base-pair sequencer. You'll find the manual in the technical database.
Was there something else?<br>
