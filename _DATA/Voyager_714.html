modern planet, with a railway bridge running over a wide river through
the middle of the city, workers of all races and species are walking
down a metal staircase from the station. Janeway is in a blue leather
suit. She takes the express lift down to a mid level walkway and into
the plant.)<br>
JANEWAY: Excuse me, can you tell me where I can find the supervisor? <br>
WORKER: Over there. <br>
JANEWAY: Thank you. <br>
SUPERVISOR: Your authorisation and licenses please? Level six in
thermal dynamics and quantum fusion. Well, Janeway, I'm impressed. <br>
JANEWAY: Thank you, sir. <br>
SUPERVISOR: Now if you can just manage to report to your shift on time.
<br>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry, I boarded the wrong transport. I ended up at the
Atmosphere Filtration Facility. <br>
SUPERVISOR: They're always looking for skilled workers. I'm surprised
they didn't offer you a job. <br>
JANEWAY: I promise I won't be late again. <br>
SUPERVISOR: Well, it's easy to get disoriented when you're new here.
I've been in this city all my life and I still get lost on occasion.
Now you'll be monitoring the primary reactor coils. They process more
than eight thousand <br>
JANEWAY: Eight thousand metric tons of tylium per second at ninety four
percent thermal efficiency. I memorised the specifications. <br>
SUPERVISOR: Let me know if there's anything you need. You'll find we
like to keep our workforce happy. <br>
JANEWAY: I can already tell it's going to be much better than my last
job.<br>
(She goes to her console, then looks around. Later -)<br>
SUPERVISOR:
The specifications you asked for. <br>
JANEWAY: Thanks. <br>(She takes the foreign style PADD and taps on a Borg
style control panel, then returns to her console.)<br>
COMPUTER: Input error four one five. Command code violation two three
zero eight. <br>
JANEWAY: Come on, shut off that damn alarm and I promise I'll never
violate you again. <br>
(A man puts his finger on a control, and the alarm stops.)<br>
JAFFEN: You almost started a core overload. <br>
JANEWAY: I would have corrected it. <br>
JAFFEN: Well I'm sorry for interrupting then, and for eavesdropping. I
overheard you talking to your console. <br>
JANEWAY: It's an old habit. <br>
JAFFEN: Does it work? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm not sure this control panel and I speak the same language
yet. <br>
JAFFEN: Well, if you need an interpreter. Jaffen. <br>
JANEWAY: Kathryn. <br>
JAFFEN: I work just down there. <br>
JANEWAY: That's good to know. <br>
SEVEN: This station doesn't require two operators. <br>
(Seven is in a tight grey suit, and a slightly different hairstyle.)<br>
JAFFEN: I don't think we've met. I'm <br>
SEVEN: Employee one three two six, and you're employee eight five eight
four. Since you're new here, you may not be fully familiar with the
labour protocols, but you should be aware that fraternising is not
permitted during work hours. <br>
JAFFEN: And do you have a number. or maybe a name? <br>
SEVEN: Annika Hansen. <br>
JAFFEN: And what exactly is your position here? <br>
SEVEN: I'm the new Efficiency Monitor. <br>
JAFFEN: Oh, I didn't know they'd hired one. <br>
SEVEN: Now that you do, I suggest you return to your station. <br>
JANEWAY: We weren't fraternising. He was just helping me correct an
input error. We're almost finished. <br>
SEVEN: Do it quickly. <br>
JANEWAY: Yes, ma'am. <br>
JAFFEN: I thought we were fraternising. Maybe we could get acquainted
after work. There is a little place some of us like to go to. We could
get a meal. <br>
JANEWAY: I can't. <br>
JAFFEN: You need to talk to someone besides your console. <br>
JANEWAY: I appreciate the offer, but with this new job I don't really
have time to socialise. </font></p>

UMALI:
They're always looking for labourers at the Power Distribution Plant. <br>
PARIS: I had a job there once. Didn't like it much. <br>
UMALI: Odd. They treat their employees well. How long were you there? <br>
PARIS: Oh, a while. <br>
UMALI: It would be very simple for me to find out. <br>
PARIS: A day. <br>
UMALI: A day? <br>
PARIS: Half a day, actually. Give or take an hour. <br>
UMALI: Not what I'd call an illustrious career. <br>
PARIS: I don't belong behind a console pushing buttons, But when I
heard some of the workers talking about your place, I knew I had to get
a job here. <br>
UMALI: You were terminated, weren't you? <br>
PARIS: Yes. <br>
UMALI: That's quite an accomplishment during a labour shortage. What
happened? <br>
PARIS: It's a long story. <br>
UMALI: I like a long story. <br>
PARIS: I had a disagreement with the new Efficiency Monitor. She didn't
think my work was very <br>
UMALI: Efficient? <br>
PARIS: Exactly. <br>
UMALI: Then why should I hire you? <br>
PARIS: Well, there's my natural charm and personality. They'd be a real
asset around a place like this where you're trying to attract patrons.
I mean, look at you. You haven't been able to tear yourself away from
me. <br>
UMALI: There's no one else here. <br>
PARIS: Please. I really need the work. <br>
UMALI: You'd better clean those tables over there. This place is going
to be filled with hungry workers as soon as the next shift ends. <br>
PARIS: You won't regret this. <br>
UMALI: Oh, I'm certain I will. (Later, when the bar is full of workers.)<br>
JAFFEN:
All of them about my father and he couldn't understand why I wasn't
insulted. Finally I just had to tell him. I'm Norvalen, I don't have a
father! <br>
(A dark man in a green leather outfit slaps the bar and laughs
hysterically.)<br>
JAFFEN: It wasn't that funny, Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: On the contrary. The man was ignorant of how your species
procreates. His attempt to disparage you ultimately humiliated him.
Irony is often a source of humour. <br>
JAFFEN: Yes, well, when you explain it like that, it's not funny at
all. <br>
TUVOK: I also have some humorous anecdotes to share. <br>
JAFFEN: I'll look forward to hearing them. <br>
(Janeway enters and goes to a spare table.)<br>
JAFFEN: I thought you didn't have
time to socialise? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm not socialising. I'm reviewing these manuals and having
something to eat. <br>
JAFFEN: Well, I recommend the Latara broth and the section on thermal
coefficients. I'll join you. <br>
JANEWAY: Really, I'm very, very busy. <br>
JAFFEN: Oh, not to socialise. To, er, help you review the manuals. <br>
(Paris brings two blue cocktails to a couple at another table.)<br>
PARIS:&nbsp;Here you are. Compliments of the
proprietress. <br>
UMALI: Tom? <br>
PARIS: I'll be right back. <br>
UMALI: The proprietress doesn't give away drinks. <br>
PARIS: Well, I'm just creating customer loyalty. <br>
UMALI: You've been creating loyalty all night with those two women. I
suggest you attend to the other tables. <br>
PARIS: Yes, ma'am. <br>
(Umali brings Janeway her plate.)<br>
UMALI: Here you are. <br>

JANEWAY: I can't believe I let you keep me out this late. <br>
JAFFEN: I felt it was my responsibility to help you study those
manuals. <br>
JANEWAY: Of course. <br>
JAFFEN: And now that I have, you should be less likely to overload the
core. You know, with all this fascinating discussion about thermal
co-efficients you never told me where you're from. <br>
JANEWAY: A planet called Earth. <br>
JAFFEN: Never heard of it. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, a long way from here. <br>
JAFFEN: What's it like? <br>
JANEWAY: Overpopulated, polluted, very little work. <br>
JAFFEN: It sounds like my home world. I guess we're both lucky to be
here. <br>
JANEWAY: It's nice to be in a place where different species get along
so well. <br>
JAFFEN: So, you admit we're getting along. <br>
JANEWAY: I was speaking in a broader cultural context. <br>
JAFFEN: I see. <br>
JANEWAY: There's a lot of violence where I come from. <br>
JAFFEN: That's too bad. <br>
JANEWAY: I still haven't adjusted to the weather here. It gets so cold
at night. <br>
SECURITY: It's almost curfew. <br>
JAFFEN: Yes, sir. We both live right here. <br>
SECURITY: Good night, then. <br>
JAFFEN: You know, one of the advantages of living in employee housing
is that we can continue sharing ideas even after the work day is over. <br>
JANEWAY: Is that so? <br>
JAFFEN: Yes, and I do have a spectacular view of the river from my
living quarters. <br>
JANEWAY: I really have to get to sleep. Maybe another time. <br>
JAFFEN: I'm sorry if I'm making you uncomfortable. <br>

JANEWAY: What inoculations? <br>
JAFFEN: They're nothing to worry about. Protection against ambient
radiation. <br>
JANEWAY: I didn't realise that was a problem. <br>

insulted them. <br>
KIM: I didn't hear you insisting that Commander Chakotay try it. <br>

JAFFEN: What are you doing? <br>
JANEWAY: If I can make the computer think the core is going to
overload, the main power should automatically shut down. </font></p>

TORRES: Five. <br>
KIM: Stand by to eject three of them. <br>
EMH: I don't think abandoning ship is the answer. <br>
KIM: Neither do I. Can you create a dampening field around the briefing
room that'll mask our lifesigns? <br>
EMH: I believe so. Why? <br>
KIM: Watch and learn. <br>(Coyote tractors the escape pods.)<br>
COYOTE [on viewscreen]: Your crew's abandoned you again. I suggest you
surrender your vessel. <br>
EMH: You should realise by now that I'm not programmed to do that. <br>(The

JAFFEN: Fraternise with a member of your crew. Well, at least my
memories weren't tampered with. According to the medical reports, I
really did come to Quarra looking for a better life. And now that I've
been promoted, I guess I've succeeded. <br>
JANEWAY: Promotion? <br>
JAFFEN: They had to replace our shift supervisor. Something about
acquiring workers illegally. <br>
