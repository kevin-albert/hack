BASHIR: Another three centimetres to the right and you would've severed
the brachial artery. Autosuture, please. And if that had happened, you
would have bled to death right there in the holosuite. <br>
MARTOK: The human fascination with what might have been is tiresome,
doctor. The artery was not severed and I am not dead. <br>
BASHIR: Oh, well, forgive me for boring you. Let me get straight to the
point. You're acting like a fool. <br>
MARTOK: Your observation is noted. But spending two years in a Dominion
prison camp has dulled my reflexes. This only proves that I need
further training. <br>
BASHIR: Turning off the holosuite safety protocols during a battle
simulation is at best dubious. For a man with only one eye it's
positively idiotic. Now, if you would consider ocular <br>
MARTOK: I do not want an artificial eye! <br>
BASHIR: Then you must accept the fact that you have a disability and
stop acting like <br>
MARTOK: There are limits as to how far I will indulge you, Doctor. <br>
CREWWOMAN [OC]: General Martok, there is a priority message for you
from the Klingon High Council. <br>
BASHIR: We're done here. <br>
MARTOK: Route the message to my quarters. <br>
CREWWOMAN [OC]: Acknowledged. <br>
MARTOK: Doctor, thank you. <br>
BASHIR: If you really want to thank me, don't walk in here dripping
blood anymore. It takes days to get it out of the carpet.

WORF: Check it now. <br>
NOG: Still no increase in phaser relay efficiency, sir. The throughput
reading is steady at one four eight point seven. <br>
WORF: Have you initialised the interface program? <br>
NOG: Yes, and then I charged the prefire chamber and recalibrated the
emitter stage. This thing just doesn't work! Sir. <br>
WORF: Very well. We'll start over. Go to the Engine Room and download
the operating system into the computer core, but this time do it one
file at a time. <br>
(Nog mimes throttling Worf.) <br>
NOG: Aye, sir. <br>
(Martok enters and Nog cannot get past him.) <br>
NOG: Good evening, General. <br>
MARTOK: Cadet. <br>
WORF: General. I did not expect you until twenty two hundred hours. <br>
MARTOK: I must cancel our appointment. I've received new orders from
the High Council, a mission of some importance. I must prepare. <br>
WORF: Of course. May glory and honour follow you on your journey. <br>
NOG: Excuse me, sirs? Could I just slip by? <br>
(Martok lets Nog leave.) <br>
WORF: How is the shoulder? <br>
MARTOK: Oh, Doctor Bashir made the necessary repairs. I told him it was
a holosuite accident. He would not understand the need to draw blood in
a warrior's training exercise. <br>
WORF: Few humans would. However, I do apologise again for the
inconvenience. I did not intend to cause so much damage. <br>
MARTOK: I was the one who did not parry the blow in time. A simple,
foolish mistake. One that I would not have made two years ago. <br>
WORF: Can you discuss the mission? <br>
MARTOK: Three days ago, the battle cruiser B'Moth began a patrol along
the Cardassian border. They have not been heard from since. They are
now reported as missing. <br>
WORF: It is possible she was destroyed by the Dominion. The Jem'Hadar
attacked a Federation starship near the border less than a week ago. <br>
MARTOK: That is our assumption as well, but we must be sure. So I have
been given command of a Bird of Prey, the Rotarran, to conduct a search
for the B'Moth. This is the first time I will have led troops in the
field since my confinement by the Dominion. <br>
WORF: It must be an exciting prospect. <br>
MARTOK: I tell you, Worf, without shame, there were days in that prison
camp when the thought that I would never again set foot in a Klingon
vessel made me weep like an old woman. <br>
WORF: I envy you the days ahead. It will be a glorious adventure. <br>
MARTOK: An adventure that we could share, my friend. I need someone I
can trust at my side. Someone whose loyalty I can count on. Worf, son
of Mogh, I ask you to join me on this mission as my friend and as my
First Officer.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: I told the General that I'm inclined to
grant his request for your services, Commander. I can certainly
understand why he wants you along. You're a fine officer. But I'm not
sure why you want to go on this mission. <br>
WORF: It is a great honour to be asked to serve under General Martok.
And he saved my life in the Dominion prison camp. <br>
SISKO: Oh? You didn't put that in your mission report. <br>
WORF: It was a personal matter, not something that belongs in an
official report. <br>
SISKO: Go on. <br>
WORF: You know that I was forced to fight the Jem'Hadar guards in the
camp. Each day they would call me to the ring and each day I would
fight. But, then there came a day when I wavered. <br>
SISKO: You mean you didn't want to go back into the ring. <br>
WORF: No. I mean I considered letting them kill me. It seemed like the
only way out. Just before I went into the ring, Martok turned to wish
me success and then he saw what I was planning. He saw it in my eyes.
It was a moment of tova'dok. <br>
SISKO: Of what? <br>
WORF: There is no human word for it. It is a moment of clarity between
two warriors on the field of battle. Much is said without the need for
words. In that moment, he knew what was in my mind. Once I realised
that he saw my intention to give up, I could no longer go through with
it. I went back into the ring and fought once more. He had given me his
warrior's heart. Perhaps it is something a human cannot understand. <br>
SISKO: As of this moment you are be relieved of all Starfleet
obligations and placed on detached service to the Imperial Klingon
Defence Forces. <br>
WORF: Thank you, sir. <br>
SISKO: Mister Worf. Q'apla! <br>

O'BRIEN: Small arms recalibration? Does that mean all the small arms on
the station? <br>
KIRA: Afraid so. And I need an experienced combat officer to do it.
Worf has already set up the parameters. All you need to do is make sure
it gets done. <br>
BASHIR: I'm the new Intelligence officer? <br>
KIRA: It has to be a Starfleet officer with a level four security
clearance. That means either you or Dax, and I need Dax to take over as
Fleet Liaison Officer. <br>
O'BRIEN: Beats retuning phaser rifles. <br>
BASHIR: Well, I certainly hope Worf's enjoying himself while we're
stuck here taking over his duties. <br>
DAX: Julian, have you ever been on a Klingon ship? If you think the
Defiant is cramped and uncomfortable, try spending a week on a bird of
prey. Worf isn't exactly taking a luxury cruise. <br>
O'BRIEN: Serving on a Klingon ship is like being with a gang of ancient
sea pirates. You advance in rank by killing the people above you, so
everywhere you turn you're surrounded by potential assassins. <br>
KIRA: but that's crazy. How can a ship function like that? <br>
DAX: It's not quite that chaotic. The social and military hierarchy of
a Klingon vessel's very strictly enforced. A subordinate can only
challenge his direct superior and only under certain conditions. <br>
BASHIR: What sort of conditions? <br>
DAX: Dereliction of duty, dishonourable conduct, cowardice. <br>
O'BRIEN: Cowardice? A Klingon? <br>
DAX: It's been known to happen. The Klingons are as diverse a people as
any. Some of them are strong, and some of them are weak. <br>
BASHIR: I'd say that those two definitely fall into the strong
category. <br>
(A young, short-haired Klingon in a sleeveless tunic and an older
companion wearing a necklace have entered. Odo isn't far behind.) <br>
KIRA: Trouble? <br>
ODO: Not yet. <br>
KIRA: I can see why they caught your attention. <br>
O'BRIEN: Are they off Martok's new ship? <br>
ODO: Just docked. <br>
O'BRIEN: They seem quiet enough. <br>
ODO: For the moment, maybe. But do you see the one on the left wearing
the necklace? <br>
BASHIR: Yes. <br>
ODO: Those are neck bones. Cardassian neck bones.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAX: Decided not to wear the sash after all? <br>
WORF: Officially, there is no House of Mogh in the Empire, so I saw
little point in wearing its emblem on a Klingon ship. <br>
DAX: How do you think the crew's going to feel about serving under a
man without a House? <br>
WORF: How they feel is unimportant. All I require from them is
obedience. <br>
DAX Spoken like an uncaring, hard-nosed, autocrat. The quintessential
First Officer. <br>
WORF: I do not wish to have a lengthy goodbye. <br>
DAX: I wasn't planning on having one. <br>
WORF: Good. <br>
(Worf enters the airlock, Jadzia follows.) <br>
WORF: Jadzia. <br>
DAX: Yes. <br>
WORF: I think it would be better to part company here on the station. <br>
DAX: Oh, I'm coming with you. <br>
WORF: What? <br>
DAX: The Rotarran is short-handed and I still have four month's leave
coming. I've already cleared it with Martok and Benjamin. I'm your new
Science Officer. <br>
WORF: Why did you not tell me? <br>
DAX: It's more fun this way. And after getting a good look at a couple
members of the Rotarran's crew, I don't think we're going to be having
a lot of fun on this mission.

TAVANA: I am Tavana, Engineering Officer. <br>

TAVANA: Dax? Are you related to the great Curzon Dax? <br>
DAX: Curzon was the last host for my symbiont. I carry his memories. <br>

he was very taken with her. <br>
DAX: Curzon was very taken with many people. <br>
TAVANA: So was my mother. <br>

battle for this ship? <br>

KORNAN: I, Kornan son of Shovak, weapons officer of the ship Rotarran,
present the glorious record of our honour and hope that you may find us
worthy of your leadership. <br>
(He hands over a PADD.) <br>
LESKIT: If you're looking for our victories, you won't find any. Not
for the last seven months. <br>
WORF: I do not need help recognising a list of failures. It is clear to
me that none of you are worthy of my blood or my life. But I will stand
for you and together we will restore honour to this ship and bring
glory to the Empire. <br>

WORF: I have accepted the crew's battle records, and on their behalf I
pledge you our lives and ask you that you lead us as commander of this
ship. <br>
MARTOK: I accept your lives into my hands. De-lak DOH! <br>
WORF: Clear all moorings. Release docking clamps. <br>

WORF: Helmsman, plot a direct course to the last known position of the

MARTOK: No. That would take us into the Tong Beak Nebula. I want to go
around the nebula. <br>
WORF: General, that will add a full day to our journey. <br>
MARTOK: I'm aware of that. There are reports of the Dominion operating
ships in the Nebula. I would like to avoid a fight with the Jem'Hadar. <br>
LESKIT: You wish to avoid a fight? <br>
MARTOK: Your tone does not sit well with me, helmsman. Our mission is
to find the B'Moth, not satisfy your warrior's pride. <br>

glad we understand each other. Now get down to the other end where you
belong. <br>

orders. Unmotivated. Insufficiently aggressive. These personnel reports
read like prison records. <br>
WORF: We should remember that the Rotarran has been beaten again and
again by the Jem'Hadar. It is not surprising that crew morale has
suffered. <br>
MARTOK: It's more than a case of low morale, Worf. This crew has been
beaten so many times they expect defeat. And that is dangerous. <br>
WORF: They need a victory. One decisive battle against the Jem'Hadar
would do much to lift their spirits. <br>
MARTOK: And mine. No one hungers for a victory over the Jem'Hadar more
than I do. No one. But we must be cautious. We cannot risk taking this
crew into combat before they're ready. <br>
WORF: They will be ready. I will see to that. <br>

TAVANA: The Cardassians were trapped between us and the asteroid field.
It was perfect. Their power was failing, they had no other ships nearby
and our weapons were fully charged. <br>
KORNAN: And we were still denied a victory. <br>
TAVANA: Three Jem'Hadar ships appeared from out of the asteroid field. <br>
DAX: Three to one are long odds. I'd say you did well just getting away
with your ship in one piece. <br>
LESKIT: Getting away is something we've become very good at. The
Rotarran can run away from battle faster than any ship in the quadrant.
<br>
TAVANA: You never could handle your bloodwine, Leskit. You sound like a
snivelling Ferengi crying about lost profit. <br>
LESKIT: That's supposed to wound my pride, but Tavana has forgotten
that no one serving on the Rotarran has any pride left. <br>
DAX: Does that include me? <br>
LESKIT: I do not wish to insult someone who brought me wine, but one
does wonder why the successor to the great Curzon Dax would consent to
serve on a ship like this. <br>
ORTAKIN: It's no mystery. She's the parMach'kai of our new First
Officer. I heard it on the space station before we left. <br>
DAX: Worf is only part of the reason I'm here. I think it is an honour
to serve under General Martok. <br>
LESKIT: You mean the one-eyed giant? <br>
DAX: I wouldn't let him hear you say that. <br>
LESKIT: He won't. Unless Worf is not the only one you're sharing a bed
this trip. <br>

empty by choice. <br>

DAX: You're really not much fun at parties are you, Kornan? <br>
KORNAN: Make your jokes. Hold off fate for another day if you can, but
this ship and all the souls within its hull are cursed. Death and
dishonour walk these corridors like members of the crew. <br>

WORF: It will not come to that. I know Martok. He is a great man. He
will not fail us, but we must give him time. <br>
DAX: Time may be the one thing we don't have, Worf. What happened in
that mess hall could happen all over this ship. And if you think the
blood looks bad on my uniform, wait until the decks are dripping with
it.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAX: Commander, I'm picking up a Klingon distress
call. It's very faint but I might be able to. It's the B'Moth. They
were attacked by the Jem'Hadar and lost main power. Heavy casualties,
at least thirty survivors. In need of assistance. Emergency power's
failing. The message repeats. <br>
WORF: Location? <br>
DAX: The signal is coming from zero five five mark three four two.
Distance at least seven light years. <br>
WORF: Helm, alter course to zero five five mark three four two. <br>
LESKIT: Understood. <br>
WORF: I will inform the General. Engineer, you have the bridge. <br>
(Worf leaves.) <br>
TAVANA: I want to thank you for what you did in the mess hall. <br>
DAX: Is Ortakin your parMach'kai? <br>
TAVANA: Things are coming to a head on this ship. When the fighting
breaks out, stay with me. I'll protect you. <br>
DAX: I was still hoping there wasn't going to be any fighting. <br>

it. If the B'Moth was attacked by the Jem'Hadar, why would there be
survivors? <br>
WORF: Since we do not know any details of the battles it is difficult
to speculate. <br>
MARTOK: We both know the Jem'Hadar do not leave a task half-finished.
If they left the ship intact and part of the crew alive, they did it
for a reason. <br>
WORF: There could be many explanations. The B'Moth could have inflicted
heavy damage on the Jem'Hadar vessels, forcing them to withdraw. The
Jem'Hadar ships could have been recalled during <br>
MARTOK: How is it I have only one eye, but I can see more clearly than
anyone around me? They deliberately left survivors on that ship. Why?
Because they want someone to try to rescue them. Oh, do not take this
personally, my friend. I spent two years with the Jem'Hadar. I do not
expect you to have the same insight into them that I do. They're
soulless creatures, Worf, fighting for no goal, no purpose except to
serve the Founders. They take no pleasure in what they do. Nothing is
glorified, nothing affirmed. To the Jem'Hadar, we are nothing more than
targets to be destroyed. I must not allow them to destroy us, Worf. I
must not <br>
WORF: With all due respect, General, we do not know the tactical
situation of the B'Moth yet. We should guard against making any
premature judgements. <br>
MARTOK: Of course. Dismissed.

DAX: I think I've got something. It's hard to make out through all the
interference, but the thermal signature looks like a ship. It's bearing
direct to starboard at an elevation of twenty five degrees. It's coming
into visual range. <br>
WORF: On screen. <br>

TAVANA: The B'Moth. <br>
DAX: Confirmed. <br>
WORF: Helm, lay in a course to bring us alongside. <br>
TAVANA: Bridge to Medical Ward, prepare to receive casualties. <br>
WORF: Assemble an armed boarding party in transporter room one. Make a

MARTOK: Hold! Commander Dax, what side of the border are they on? <br>
DAX: They're five hundred thousand kellicams inside Cardassian
territory, sir. They must have drifted across a couple of days ago. <br>
MARTOK: There are probably five Jem'Hadar warships out there right now
just waiting for us to cross the border. <br>
WORF: General, if they are nearby, they do not care what side of the
border we are on. They will simply attack. <br>
MARTOK: I have explicit orders from the High Council not to enter
Cardassian territory. <br>
WORF: I am certain the Council will not object under these
circumstances. There are survivors still aboard the B'Moth. <br>
MARTOK: We do not know that. All that we know is there is an automated
distress call. They could all be dead by now. <br>
WORF: And if they are not? <br>
MARTOK: Then there is nothing we can do for them. <br>
TAVANA: General, you don't intend to just leave them there? <br>
MARTOK: I will not throw away the lives of this crew in a futile rescue
attempt. <br>
WORF: They are Klingon warriors, we just cannot <br>
MARTOK: I have made my decision! We will not cross the border! From
this moment, anyone who questions that, anyone, will be charged with
treasonable disobedience. Worf, you have the Bridge. <br>

WORF: Stations! Stations! <br>
DAX: We can't just leave those men out there to die. <br>
WORF: No. <br>
DAX: So what are you going to do? <br>
WORF: The only thing I can do. Challenge Martok for command of this
ship. <br>
DAX: I agree. But you realise he may not step aside willingly. <br>
WORF: I know. But if the General will not step aside I will have to
kill him. <br>

disruptor pistol and puts it on her console, ready. Kornan and Leskit
approach Worf.) <br>
KORNAN: Martok must die. <br>
WORF: That is not your decision. <br>
LESKIT: He is a coward. While he commands, he dishonours us all. <br>
WORF: I shed no tears for your dishonour, Leskit. <br>
LESKIT: Today would be a bad day to die, son of Mogh. Take your Trill
and go. <br>
(Dax is tapping at her console. Worf looks at her and she nods.) <br>
WORF: Unlikely. <br>
LESKIT: I was hoping you would say something like that. <br>
(Ortakin enters with a disruptor rifle and two security.) <br>
WORF: Alert status one. All hands to battle stations. We are going to
rescue the B'Moth survivors. <br>
(Martok enters.) <br>
MARTOK: Who gave the order to? What's going on here? <br>
WORF: As First Officer, I say that you are unfit to serve as Captain. <br>
MARTOK: You what? <br>
WORF: You are a coward and I challenge you for command of this ship. <br>
MARTOK: I never would have expected this from you, Worf. <br>
(They draw knives and start the fight. Worf gets first blood. The crowd
urges him on. Worf is close to killing Martok, but Martok pushes him
away. Finally, Martok stabs Worf in the abdomen.) <br>
CREW: Martok! Martok! Martok! Martok! Martok! <br>
TAVANA: Tactical alert! Tactical alert! There is a Jem'Hadar warship
bearing one eight zero mark two one five. They will be within weapons
range in nine minutes. <br>
MARTOK: The Jem'Hadar will soon learn to regret this day. Who is with
me? <br>
DAX: Sometimes I think I know why I love you. Let's go to the Medical
Ward. <br>
KORNAN: Shields and weapons ready. <br>
WORF: Wait. <br>

BASHIR: Oh, I can't talk about it. All I can do is read these

WORF: General. <br>
MARTOK: The High Council has issued a commendation for the entire crew
of the Rotarran. It would seem that you were right. They view the
destruction of a Jem'Hadar ship and the rescue of thirty five warriors
as ample justification for crossing the Cardassian border. Your actions
on the Rotarran, at the time I thought they were disloyal, but I have
come to realise that your intention was to remind me of my duty as a
soldier of the Empire and as a warrior. For that I am grateful. <br>
WORF: You did the same for me once. <br>
MARTOK: Worf. On the bridge during the fight, when you dropped your
guard. How did you know I would not kill you? <br>
WORF: I did not know. <br>
MARTOK: I see you're still wearing the crest of the House of Mogh. <br>
WORF: Yes. Jadzia calls it a sentimental gesture. <br>
MARTOK: Ah. Perhaps you would consider replacing sentiment with the
symbol of a new beginning. <br>
(He takes his crest from his sleeve.) <br>
MARTOK: The House of Martok would be honoured to welcome the Son of
Mogh into our family as a warrior and a brother. <br>
