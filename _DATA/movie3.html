<b>[Enterprise engineering]</b>
<p>
SPOCK: Don't grieve, Admiral, ...it is logical. The needs of the many ...outweigh...<br>
KIRK: ...the needs of the few.<br>
SPOCK: Or the one. I have been ...and always shall be ...your friend. ...Live long ...and prosper.<br>
<p>
<b>[Torpedo bay]</b>
<p>
KIRK (OC): We are assembled here today to pay final respects to our honoured dead. This death takes place in the shadow of new life, the sunrise of a new world, a world that our beloved comrade gave his life to protect and nourish. He did not feel that sacrifice a vain or empty one. Of my friend, I can only say this. Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, ...his was the most ...human.<br>
SULU (OC): Honours, ...hup!<br>
(the torpedo coffin is fired and lays in a clearing in the new, verdant forest on the Genesis Planet)<br>
<p>
Spock's Voice: Space, the final frontier. ...These are the continuing voyages of the Starship Enterprise. ...Her ongoing mission, to explore strange new worlds. ...To seek out new lifeforms and new civilisations. ...To boldly go where no man has gone before.<br>
<p>
OPENING CREDITS<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise bridge]</b>
<p>
U.S.S. Enterprise. Captain's personal log. With most of our battle damage repaired, we're almost home. Yet I feel uneasy and I wonder why. Perhaps it's the emptiness of this vessel. Most of our trainee crew has been reassigned. Lieutenant Saavik and my son, David are exploring the Genesis planet which he helped create. And Enterprise feels like a house with all the children gone. No, more empty than even that. The death of Spock is like an open wound. It seems that I have left the noblest part of myself back there ...on that newborn planet.<br>
<p>
KIRK: Status, Mister Sulu?<br>
SULU: On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.<br>
KIRK: Very well, ...Mister Chekov, I'll need pre-approach scan. ...Take the science station, please.<br>
CHEKOV: Yes sir.<br>
KIRK: Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?<br>
UHURA: No sir, there is no response.<br>
KIRK: That's very odd. ...Scotty, progress report?<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise engineering]</b>
<p>
SCOTT: I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise bridge]</b>
<p>
KIRK: Your timing is excellent, Mister Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out of here?<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise engineering]</b>
<p>
SCOTT: Eight weeks, sir. But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise bridge]</b>
<p>
KIRK: Mister Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise engineering]</b>
<p>
SCOTT: Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?<br>
KIRK (on intercom): Your reputation is secure, Scotty.
<p>
<b>[Enterprise bridge]</b>
<p>
KIRK: Mister Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.<br>
SULU: Aye sir.<br>
TRAINEE FOSTER: Sir, ...I was wondering. ...Are they planning a ceremony when we get in? ...I mean, a reception?<br>
KIRK: A hero's welcome, son? Is that what you'd like? ...Well, God knows, there should be. This time we paid for the party with our dearest blood.<br>
<p>
<b>[Merchantman bridge]</b>
<p>
CAPTAIN: Steady, ...steady boys. Keep scanning... I thought you people were reliable. ...Where the hell is he!<br>
VALKRIS: He has been here for some time. Put me on the hailing frequency. Commander Kruge, this is Valkris. (in Klingonese) I have obtained the Federation data. Ready to transmit.<br>
KRUGE (OC): Well done, Valkris, ...well done.<br>
CAPTAIN: What the hell is...?<br>
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Disengage cloaking device!<br>
(the Bird-of-Prey decloaks)<br>
<p>
<b>[Bird-of-Prey bridge]</b>
<p>
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Lights up!<br>
(Kruge has a fearsome pet at his feet)<br>
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Transmit data. ...Now!<br>
<p>
<b>[Merchantman bridge]</b>
<p>
VALKRIS: (in Klingonese) Transmission completed. ...You will find it useful.<br>
<p>
<b>[Bird-of-Prey bridge]</b>
<p>
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Then you have seen i?<br>
<p>
<b>[Merchantman bridge]</b>
<p>
VALKRIS: (in Klingonese) I have, my lord.<br>
<p>
<b>[Bird-of-Prey bridge]</b>
<p>
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Unfortunate.<br>
<p>
<b>[Merchantman bridge]</b>
<p>
VALKRIS: (in Klingonese) Understood.<br>
<p>
<b>[Bird-of-Prey bridge]</b>
<p>
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) Thrusters!<br>
<p>
<b>[Merchantman bridge]</b>
<p>
CAPTAIN: What's the hell's going on? When do I get paid off?<br>
VALKRIS: Soon, Captain, quite soon. (in Klingonese) Success, my lord ...and my love.<br>
<p>
<b>[Bird-of-Prey bridge]</b>
<p>
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) You will be remembered with honour. ...Fire.<br>
(the Merchantman is destroyed)<br>
KRUGE: (in Klingonese) New course. Federation Neutral Zone. (about the pet) ...Feed him!<br>
MALTZ: (in Klingonese) Yes, my lord!<br>
<p>
(the Enterprise approaches Spacedock)
<p>
<b>[Enterprise bridge]</b>
<p>
UHURA: Approach control, ...this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.<br>
SPACEDOCK CONTROLLER (on intercom): Enterprise is cleared to dock.<br>
KIRK: Lock on!<br>
SULU: Systems locked.<br>
KIRK: Spacedock, you have control.<br>
SPACEDOCK CONTROLLER (on intercom): Affirmative, Enterprise. Enjoy the ride, and welcome home.<br>
KIRK: Enterprise confirms.<br>
<p>
<b>[Spacedock control room]</b>
<p>
VOICE (OC): Acknowledge, door closed.<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise bridge]</b>
<p>
UHURA: Would you look at that?<br>
(U.S.S. Excelsior on viewscreen)<br>
KIRK: My friends, the great experiment. The Excelsior, ready for trial runs.<br>
SULU: She's supposed to have transwarp drive.<br>
SCOTT: Aye. And if my grandmother had wheels, she'd be a wagon.<br>
KIRK: Tut tut, Mister Scott. Young minds. Fresh ideas. ...Be tolerant.<br>
(Commander Rand watches nostalgically from the Spacedock cafeteria)<br>
COMPUTER VOICE: Enterprise, stand by for final docking procedure.<br>
KIRK: Stand by umbilical and gravitational support systems.<br>
SULU: Aye sir, moorings activated. ...All systems standing by.<br>
CHEKOV: Admiral, ...this is not possible.<br>
KIRK: Mister Chekov?<br>
CHEKOV: An energy reading from 'C' deck ...from inside Mister Spock's quarters.<br>
KIRK: I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!<br>
CHEKOV: Yes sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless I am reading a lifeform there.<br>
KIRK: This entire crew seems on the edge of obsessive behaviour concerning Mister Spock.<br>
UHURA: Sir! Security reports the door to Spock's quarters has been forced.<br>
KIRK: I'm on my way. Sulu, continue docking procedure.<br>
SULU (OC): Aye sir.<br>
(Chekov says something in Russian to Scott about the security alert)<br> 
<p>
<b>[Spock's quarters]</b>
<p>
McCOY: (in Spock's voice) Jim, ...Help me. ...You left me on Genesis. ...Why did you do that? ...Help me.<br>
KIRK: Bones, ...what the hell are you doing? Have you lost your mind!<br>
McCOY: Help me, Jim. ...Take me home.<br>
KIRK: Bones, we are. We are home.<br>
McCOY: Then perhaps it's not too late. ...Climb the steps, Jim. ...Climb the steps of Mount Seleya.<br>
KIRK: Mount Seleya? Bones, Mount Seleya is on Vulcan! We're home, ...on Earth!<br>
McCOY: (in Spock's voice) Remember!<br>
UHURA (on intercom): Admiral, docking is completed. Starfleet Commander Morrow is on his way for inspection.<br>
KIRK: Uhura! Get the medics down here! Get them now!<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise torpedo bay]</b>
<p>
MORROW: You've all done remarkable service under the most difficult conditions. You'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendation, and more importantly, extended shore leave. ...That is, all but you, Mister Scott. They need your wisdom on the new Excelsior. ...Report there tomorrow as Captain of Engineering.<br>
SCOTT: With all appreciation, sir, I'd prefer to supervise the refit of Enterprise.<br>
MORROW: I'm afraid that won't be necessary.<br>
SCOTT: But, sir...<br>
MORROW: I'm sorry, Mister Scott, but there will be no refit.<br>
KIRK: Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise is not...<br>
MORROW: Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We feel her day is over.<br>
KIRK: But we had requested... We'd hoped to take her back to Genesis.<br>
MORROW: That is out of the question.<br>
KIRK: May I ask why?<br>
MORROW: In your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy. ...Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis. Consider it a quarantined planet, and a forbidden subject.<br>
<p>
<b>[Bird-of-Prey bridge]</b>
<p>
KIRK (on viewscreen): To fully understand the events on which I report, it is necessary to review the theoretical data on the Genesis device as developed by Doctors Carol and David Marcus. Genesis, simply put, is life from lifelessness. It was the intention to introduce the Genesis Device into a preselected area of a lifeless space body, a moon or other dead form. The device when delivered would instantaneously cause the Genesis effect. Instead of a dead moon, a living, breathing planet now exists, capable of sustaining whatever lifeforms we see fit to deposit on it.<br>
KRUGE: So? Speak!<br>
TORG: Great power ...to control, ...dominate.<br>
KRUGE: Speak.<br>
MATLZ: Impressive. ...They can make planets.<br>
KRUGE: Oh yes, ...new cities, homes in the country, ...your woman at your side, children playing at your feet. And overhead, fluttering in the breeze, the flag of the Federation. Charming. ...Station!<br>
MALTZ: Yes, my lord!<br>
KRUGE: Share this with no one.<br>
TORG: Understood, my lord.<br>
KRUGE: We are going to this planet. Even as our emissaries negotiate for peace with the Federation, we will act for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!<br>
TORG: Success, my lord.<br>

<p>
<b>[Grissom bridge]</b>
<p>
SAAVIK (OC): We have reached destination planet at point zero three five.<br>
ESTEBAN: Very well, Lieutenant. Helm. ...Execute standard orbital approach.<br>
HELMSMAN: Standard orbit. Aye sir.<br>
ESTEBAN: Communications! Send a coded message for Starfleet Commander, priority one. ...'Federation Science Vessel Grissom arriving Genesis Planet, Mutara Sector to begin research. J.T. Esteban, commanding.'<br>
COMM OFFICER: Aye sir, coding now.<br>
ESTEBAN: Doctor Marcus, it's your planet.<br>
DAVID: Begin scanning, please. ...This is where the fun begins, Saavik!<br>
SAAVIK: Just like your father, so human. ...All units functional, recorders are on. Scanning sector one. The foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty-two point two Celsius.<br>
DAVID: Sector two. Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.<br>
SAAVIK: Sector three. Sub-tropical vegetation. ...Temperature decreasing rapidly.<br>
DAVID: It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!<br>
SAAVIK: Fascinating.<br>
DAVID: All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!<br>
(console bleeps)<br>
SAAVIK: Metallic mass.<br>
DAVID: Close-range scan. ...A photon tube! ...Gravitational fields were in flux. ...It must have soft-landed!<br>
ESTEBAN: In code to Starfleet. 'Captain's Spock's tube located on Genesis surface.'<br>
COMM OFFICER: Yes sir, ...coding your message.<br>
DAVID: I don't believe it.<br>
ESTEBAN: What is it?<br>
SAAVIK: If equipment is functioning properly, indications are ...an animal lifeform.<br>
ESTEBAN: You said there wouldn't be any...<br>
DAVID: There shouldn't be any.<br>
SAAVIK: Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable lifeform reading.<br>
COMM OFFICER: Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?<br>
ESTEBAN: Wait a minute! ...We don't know what we're talking about here.<br>
DAVID: Why don't we beam it up?<br>
ESTEBAN: Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state, 'nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated.'<br>
SAAVIK: Captain, ...the logical alternative is obvious. ...Beaming down to the surface is permitted.<br>
ESTEBAN: Yes, if the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger.<br>
DAVID: Captain, please, ...we'll take the risk, but we've got to find out what it is.<br>
SAAVIK: Or who.<br>
<p>
<b>[Kirk's apartment]</b>
<p>
KIRK: Absent friends.<br>
SULU: Admiral, what's going to happen to the Enterprise?<br>
KIRK: She's to be decommissioned.<br>
CHEKOV: Will we get another ship?<br>
KIRK: I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand and wait.<br>
UHURA: Sir? About Doctor McCoy, how is he?<br>
KIRK: He's home, resting comfortably, pumped full of tranquillisers. They say it's exhaustion. He promised me he'd stay put. Well we'll see.<br>
(door chimes)<br>
KIRK: Ah, Mister Scott. ...Come. ...Sarek! ...Ambassador, I had no idea you were here... I believe you know my crew.<br>
SAREK: I will speak with you alone, Kirk.<br>
KIRK: Please excuse us. ...Ambassador, I would have come to
