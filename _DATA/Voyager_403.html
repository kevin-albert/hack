Commander Chakotay. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I understand you wanted to see me. <br>
SEVEN: I'm told you are the officer in charge of personnel. That you
prepare the duty assignments. Is that the correct phrase? <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's right. <br>
SEVEN: I am finding it difficult to spend so much time alone. I am
unaccustomed to it. The hours do not pass quickly. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I can understand that. How can we help? <br>
SEVEN: I've been considering the matter carefully. I would like to
request a duty assignment. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Did you have something specific in mind? <br>
SEVEN: Yes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
Now what!?<br>
VORIK: There's been a rupture in the coolant injector. <br>
TORRES: I can see that. Why haven't you sealed it off? <br>
VORIK: I am attempting to do so. <br>(The leak stops.)<br>
TORRES: That's better. <br>
VORIK: Lieutenant, I have an idea. Perhaps it would be advisable to
reconfigure the coolant assembly. That would give us greater control
over the pressure valve emissions. <br>
TORRES: You're probably right. And tomorrow we can do it first thing.
But not today. <br>
VORIK: I don't understand. Why wait until tomorrow? Today would be a
much better <br>
TORRES: Not today, Vorik. <br>
PARIS: Good morning. Here's the helm control evaluation you wanted. <br>
TORRES: Thank you. <br>
PARIS: Are we still on for dinner tonight? <br>
TORRES: I may have to work. I'll let you know. <br>
PARIS: Ah ha. Okay. Have you decided if you're, if you're going through
with it? <br>
TORRES: I have. And I'm not. Today hasn't started out very well, and
the last thing I need is to get involved with some obscure Klingon
ritual. <br>
PARIS: You were the one who suggested it. <br>
TORRES: I know. And for one sentimental minute I thought that I might
actually go through with it. But not anymore. <br>
PARIS: Of course not. You wouldn't want to get too sentimental. <br>
TORRES: I overslept this morning because I forgot to tell the computer
to wake me. And then the acoustic inverter in my sonic shower blew out.
<br>
PARIS: That'll make your hair stand on end. <br>
TORRES: So I didn't have time for breakfast. And when I got here two
people were out sick, so I had to cancel the fuel cell overhaul. And
then an injector burst for no apparent reason and started spewing
plasma coolant <br>
PARIS: That's a run of bad luck, all right. <br>
TORRES: So I am in a bad mood, and I know that I am being a little bit
testy. <br>
PARIS: No, that's okay. Think about that dinner.<br>(Chakotay enters. Paris whispers to him on his way out.)<br>PARIS: &nbsp;Be careful. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Something interesting just happened. <br>
TORRES: What's that? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Seven of Nine requested a duty assignment. <br>
TORRES: Fascinating. <br>
CHAKOTAY: She wants to work in Engineering. <br>
TORRES: What? <br>
CHAKOTAY: The Borg use transwarp conduits to travel through space
faster than warp speed. If we could create one of them. <br>
TORRES: We don't know anything about transwarp technology. Playing
around with it could be dangerous. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's where Seven of Nine comes in. She's offered to work
with you. <br>
TORRES: What do you think her real motives are? <br>
CHAKOTAY: She's having a tough time making the transition from the
Collective. She wants something to do. <br>
TORRES: I never thought of you as naive, Chakotay. The bottom line is,
I don't want her working in Engineering. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The bottom line is, I'm giving you an order and you're going
to follow it, Lieutenant. <br>
TORRES: Whatever you say, sir. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Seven of Nine, you told me you wouldn't make any more attempts
to contact the Borg. I want to believe that's true. <br>
SEVEN: I assure you it is. <br>
JANEWAY: I've decided not to post a security detail while you're in
Engineering, but you have to realise there are rules. You'll be
expected to follow our protocols. You'll report directly to Lieutenant
Torres and obey any order she gives you. <br>
SEVEN: I understand. <br>
JANEWAY: One more thing. Your designation, Seven of Nine, it's a little
cumbersome. Wouldn't you prefer to be called by your given name,
Annika? <br>
SEVEN: I have been Seven of Nine for as long as I can remember. <br>
JANEWAY: All right. But maybe we could streamline it a little. How
would you feel about Seven? <br>
SEVEN: Imprecise, but acceptable. <br>
TUVOK [OC]: Tuvok to Captain Janeway. <br>
JANEWAY: Yes, Tuvok. </font></p>

[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
Please come to the bridge. A ship is approaching. <br>(Janeway enters, with Seven following.)<br>TUVOK: It's damaged but
functional. Energy emissions are so low, it's probably not capable of
warp speed. Several dozen lifesigns aboard. We are being hailed,
Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Open a channel. I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Federation starship Voyager. <br>
RAHMIN [on viewscreen]: I am Rahmin. My people are the Caatati. I
apologise for our appearance and the condition of our ship. Most of our
people were assimilated by the Borg over a year ago. We lost
everything. <br>
JANEWAY: How many of you escaped? <br>
RAHMIN [on viewscreen]: A few thousand on thirty ships. All that's left
from a planet of millions. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sorry. <br>
RAHMIN [on viewscreen]: Captain, I want to assure you, my people were
once proud and accomplished. <br>
