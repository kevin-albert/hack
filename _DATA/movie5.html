SYBOK: I thought weapons were forbidden on this planet. ... Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.<br>
J'ONN: It's all I have.<br>
SYBOK: Your pain runs deep.<br>
J'ONN: What do you know of my pain?<br>
SYBOK: Let us explore it ...together. ...Each man hides a secret pain. It must be exposed and reckoned with. It must be dragged from the darkness and forced into the light. Share your pain. ...Share your pain with me and gain strength from it.<br>
J'ONN: Where did you get this power?<br>
SYBOK: The power was within you.<br>
J'ONN: It is as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?<br>
SYBOK: Join my quest.<br>
J'ONN: What is it you seek?<br>
SYBOK: What you seek. What all men have sought since time began, ...the ultimate knowledge. To find it, we'll need a starship.<br>
J'ONN: A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus Three.<br>
SYBOK: Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.<br>
J'ONN: But how?<br>
SYBOK: Have faith my friend. There are more of us than you know.<br>

<p>
SPOCK: Greetings, Captain.<br>
KIRK: Spock! ...What are you doing in this neck of the woods?<br>
SPOCK: I have been monitoring your progress.<br>
KIRK: I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite, you pick me.<br>
SPOCK: I regret to inform you that the record time for free-climbing El Capitan is in no danger of being broken.<br>
KIRK: I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain.<br>
SPOCK: And that is?<br>
KIRK: Because it's there.<br>
SPOCK: Captain, I do not think you realise the gravity of your situation.<br>
KIRK: On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Doctor McCoy for a while?<br>
SPOCK: I believe that Doctor McCoy is not in the best of moods.<br>

CAITHLIN: Gentlemen, I'm Caithlin Dar.<br>
TALBOT: Ah, yes. Our new Romulan representative. Welcome to Paradise City, my dear, capital of the so-called 'Planet of Galactic Peace.' I'm St. John Talbot, the Federation representative here on Nimbus Three and my charming companion, here, is the Klingon consul Korrd.<br>
KORRD: Ugghhhh!<br>
CAITHLIN: I expect that's Klingon for hello.<br>
TALBOT (OC): Won't you come in, my dear?<br>
(Sybok and his followers approach Paradise City)<br>
CAITHLIN: Twenty years ago, our three governments agreed to develop this planet together. A new age was born.<br>
TALBOT: Our new age died a quick death. And the settlers we conned into coming here, they were the dregs of the galaxy. They immediately took to fighting amongst themselves. We forbad them weapons, but they soon began to fashion their own.<br>
CAITHLIN: Right! Then it appears I've arrived just in time.<br>
(a klaxon sounds and the three of them rush outside as Sybok and his followers storm the city)<br>

<p>
J'ONN: Get away from that transmitter!<br>
SYBOK: Romulan. ...Terran. ...Klingon. Consider yourselves my prisoners.<br>
TALBOT: Prisoners? We're already prisoners here on this worthless lump of rock. What possible value could we be to you?<br>
SYBOK: Nimbus Three may be a worthless lump of rock, but it does have one unique treasure. It's the only place in the entire galaxy that has the three of you.<br>
CAITHLIN: I don't know who you are or what you want but I can tell you this. Our governments will stop at nothing to ensure our safety.<br>
SYBOK: That's exactly what I'm counting on.<br>

SCOTT (OC): U.S.S. Enterprise, shakedown cruise report. I think this new ship was put together by monkeys. Och, she's got a fine engine, but half the doors won't open, and guess whose job it is to make it right?

SCOTT: Borgus frat! 'Let's see what she's got' said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?<br>
UHURA: I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.<br>
SCOTT: Uhura, I thought you were on leave?<br>
UHURA: And I thought we were supposed to be going together.<br>
SCOTT: Oh I can't leave her when she needs me the most.<br>
UHURA: I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us ...dinner.<br>
SCOTT: Oh lass, you're the most understanding woman I know.<br>
COMMAND VOICE: (distorted) RED ALERT. RED ALERT.<br>
SCOTT: I just fixed that damn thing. Turn it off, will you?<br>
COMMAND VOICE: RED ALERT. RED ALERT. This is a RED ALERT. Enterprise, acknowledge.<br>
UHURA: This is Enterprise. Identify yourself.<br>
COMMAND VOICE: Enterprise, this is Starfleet. We have a Priority Seven situation in the Neutral Zone.<br>
UHURA: Stand by, Starfleet. ...Scotty, this is for real.<br>
SCOTT: They can't be serious! The ship's in pieces and we've got less than a skeleton crew aboard.<br>
UHURA: Starfleet, are you aware of our current status?<br>
COMMAND VOICE: Current status understood. Stand by to copy operational orders and recall key personnel.<br>

McCOY: Come and get it! Come and get it!<br>
KIRK: Bones! Bones! Knock it off. We're right here, ...and we're starving.<br>
SPOCK: Bi-podal seeds, Doctor?<br>
McCOY: Beans, Spock, but no ordinary beans. These are from an old Southern recipe handed down to me by my father. And if you stick your Vulcan nose up at these, you're not only insulting me, but generations of McCoys.<br>
SPOCK: In that case, I have little choice but to sample your beans. ...Hm! Surprisingly good. It does have a flavouring I am not familiar with.<br>
McCOY: Ah! That's the secret ingredient.<br>
KIRK: Got any more of that secret ingredient, Bones?<br>
McCOY: Be my guest, Captain.<br>
KIRK: Thank you.<br>
SPOCK: Am I to understand that your secret ingredient is ...alcohol?<br>
McCOY: Whiskey. Tennessee whiskey, Spock! . Care for a little snort?<br>
KIRK: Bourbon and beans. An explosive combination. Do you think Spock can handle it?<br>
McCOY: Are you kidding? With that Vulcan metabolism he could eat a bowl of termites and it wouldn't bother him.<br>
SPOCK: As you are so fond of pointing out, Doctor, I am half human.<br>
McCOY: Well, it certainly doesn't show.<br>
SPOCK: Thank you.<br>
McCOY: How do you like it? This guy never changes. I insult him and he takes it as a compliment. ...Uh, you two of you could drive a man to drink.<br>
KIRK: Me? What did I do?<br>
McCOY: What did you do? You piss me off. Human life is far too precious to risk on crazy stunts. Maybe it didn't cross that macho mind of yours that you should have been killed when you fell off that mountain.<br>
KIRK: It crossed my mind.<br>
McCOY: And?<br>
KIRK: And, as I fell, I knew I wouldn't die.<br>
McCOY: I thought he was the only one who's immortal.<br>
KIRK: It isn't that, Bones. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.<br>
SPOCK: I do not understand.<br>
KIRK: I've always known ...I'll die alone.<br>
McCOY: Well, I'll call Valhalla and reserve you a room. It's a mystery what draws us together. All that time in space ...getting on each other's nerves ...and what do we do when shore leave comes along? We spend it together. Other people have families.<br>
KIRK: Other people, Bones. Not us. ...What are you doing?<br>
SPOCK: I am preparing to toast a 'marsh melon'.<br>
McCOY: Well, I'll be damned. A marsh melon. Where did you learn to do that?<br>
SPOCK: Before leaving the ship I consulted the computer library to familiarise myself with the customs associated with 'camping out.'<br>
McCOY: Tell me, Spock. What do we do after we toast the marsh, ...er, melons?<br>
SPOCK: We consume them.<br>
McCOY: I know we consume them. I mean after that.<br>
SPOCK: I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the sing-a-long.<br>
KIRK: I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. Wait a minute. Bones, what are we gonna sing?<br>
McCOY: How about 'Camptown Races?'<br>
KIRK: 'Pack Up Your Troubles.'<br>
SPOCK: Are we leaving, Captain?<br>
McCOY: It's a song title, Spock.<br>
SPOCK: Ah.<br>
KIRK: 'Moon Over Rigel Seven?'<br>
McCOY: 'Row, Row, Row Your Boat.'<br>
KIRK: 'Row, Row, Row Your Boat.' I love 'Row, Row... Do you 'Row, Row, ...Row Your Boat', Spock?<br>
SPOCK: That song did not come up in my research, Captain.<br>
KIRK: The lyrics are very simple. It's 'Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream, ...merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.' The Doctor and I will start it off and then when we give you the signal you jump in. Doctor if you please.<br>
McCOY: Don't say I didn't warn you.<br>
KIRK/McCOY: 'Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream merrily, merrily, merrily, ...merrily, life...'<br>
KIRK: Come on, Spock? Why didn't you jump in?<br>
SPOCK: I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.<br>
McCOY: It's a song, you green-blooded a Vulcan. You sing it. The words aren't important. What's important is that you have a good time singing it.<br>
SPOCK: Oh, I am sorry, Doctor. ...Were we having a good time?<br>
McCOY: God! I liked him better before he died.<br>
KIRK: No, no, no, stop it. Let's... Let's go to bed and just let's get some sleep?<br>
SPOCK: Captain?<br>
KIRK: Spock, we're on leave. Call me Jim.<br>
SPOCK: Jim?<br>
KIRK: Yes, Spock?<br>
SPOCK: Life is not a dream.<br>
KIRK: Go to sleep, Spock.<br>
SPOCK: Yes Captain.<br>
KIRK: Good night, Bones.<br>
McCOY: Good night, Jim.<br>
KIRK: Good night, Spock.<br>
SPOCK: Good night, Doctor.<br>

KLAA: (in Klingonese) And the others?<br>
VIXIS: (in Klingonese) A Terran and a Romulan.<br>

KIRK: You caught me on my way to the shower.<br>
ADMIRAL BENNETT (on viewscreen)): I apologise for cancelling shore leave but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus Three.<br>
KIRK: On 'The Planet of Galactic Peace?'<br>
ADMIRAL BENNETT (on viewscreen): The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement and they've taken hostages. The Klingon, the Romulan and the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...<br>
KIRK: With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the Quadrant.<br>
ADMIRAL BENNETT (on viewscreen): Other ships, yes, but no experienced commanders. Captain, ...I need Jim Kirk. Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus Three, assess the situation and avoid confrontation if possible. Above all, however, all get those hostages back safely.<br>
KIRK: Have the Klingons responded?<br>
ADMIRAL BENNETT (on viewscreen): No, but you can bet they will.<br>
KIRK: Understood. Kirk out. Plot course to Nimbus Three, Mister Sulu.<br>

CAITHLIN (on viewscreen): A short time ago we surrendered ourselves to the forces of the Galactic Army of Light. At this moment, we are in their protective custody. Their leader assures us that we will be treated humanely as long as we co-operate with his demands. I believe his sincerity. He requests that you send a Federation starship to parlay for our release at once. Be assured we are in good health and would appreciate your immediate response.<br>

SPOCK: There was a young student, ...exceptionally gifted, ...possessing ...great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.<br>
KIRK: What do you mean?<br>
SPOCK: The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.<br>
KIRK: Forbidden?<br>
SPOCK: He rejected his logical upbringing. He embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.<br>
KIRK: Why?<br>
SPOCK: He believed that the key to self-knowledge was emotion, ...not logic.<br>

SPOCK: Where Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.<br>
KIRK: But the center of the Galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.<br>
SPOCK: Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.<br>
KIRK: Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here, you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. ...Until then, you're either with me or you're not.<br>

SCOTT: I don't have the time. The Captain told me to get this transporter working and I'm not about to let him down.<br>
(everybody on the bridge is transfixed by the viewscreen and they do not notice a warning about the Klingon ship)<br>
<p>
<b>[Sha Ka Ree crater]</b>
<p>
SYBOK: We have travelled far ...by starship.<br>
KIRK: Enterprise, this is Kirk. ...We have...<br>
SPOCK: Sybok. ...Perhaps...<br>
(the ground begins to shake, the skies darken and great rock columns shoot from the ground forming a temple. The four move into the temple and a blue luminescence shoots from the ground and into space)<br>
GOD (OC): Brave souls. Welcome.<br>
McCOY: Is this the voice of God?<br>
GOD (OC): One voice, many faces.<br>
GOD: Does this better suit your expectations?<br>
SYBOK: Qual se tu?<br>
GOD: It is I. ...The journey you took to reach me could not have been an easy one.<br>
SYBOK: It was not. The Barrier stood between us ...but we breached it.<br>
GOD: Magnificent. You are the first to find me.<br>
SYBOK: We sought only your infinite wisdom.<br>
GOD: And how did you breach the Barrier?<br>
SYBOK: With a starship!<br>
GOD: This starship. ...Could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?<br>
SYBOK: It could. Yes!<br>
GOD: Then I shall make use of this starship.<br>
SYBOK: It will be your chariot!<br>
KIRK: Excuse me.<br>
GOD: It will carry my power to every corner of creation.<br>
KIRK: Excuse me. ...I'd just like to ask a question. ...What does God need with a starship?<br>
GOD: Bring the ship closer.<br>
KIRK: I said ...'What does God need with a starship?'<br>
McCOY: Jim, what are you doing?<br>
KIRK: I'm asking a question.<br>
GOD: Who is this creature?<br>
KIRK: Who am I? Don't you know? Aren't you God?<br>
SYBOK: He ...has his doubts.<br>
GOD: You doubt me?<br>
KIRK: I seek proof.<br>
McCOY: Jim, you don't ask the Almighty for his I.D.<br>
GOD: Then here is the proof you seek.<br>
(blue light rays shoot from God's eyes knocking Kirk backwards)<br>
KIRK: Why is God angry?<br>
SYBOK: Why? Why have you done this to my friend?<br>
GOD: He doubts me.<br>
SPOCK: You have not answered his question. What does God need with a starship?<br>
(blue light rays shoot from God's eyes again knocking Spock backwards)<br>
GOD: Do you doubt me?<br>
McCOY: I doubt any God who inflicts pain for his own pleasure.<br>
SYBOK: Stop! The God of Sha Ka Ree would not do this!<br>
GOD: Sha Ka Ree? A vision you created. An eternity I've been imprisoned in this place! The ship! I must have the ship! Now ...give me what I want!<br>
SPOCK: Sybok, ...this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree, ...or any other God!<br>
SYBOK: I don't understand... Reveal yourself to me!<br>
(an image of Sybok strides out of one of God's eyes)<br>
SYBOK/GOD: What's wrong? Don't you like this face? I have so many but this one suits you best.<br>
SYBOK: No! No, ...it's not possible.<br>
GOD: Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!<br>
SYBOK: The ship.<br>
GOD: Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it or watch these puny beings ...die horribly.<br>
SYBOK: What have I done?<br>
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully.<br>
SPOCK: Sybok.<br>
SYBOK: This is my doing! This is my arrogance, ... my vanity...<br>
SPOCK: Sybok, we must find a way...<br>
SYBOK: No! Save yourselves! ...Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.<br> ...I couldn't help but notice your pain.<br>
GOD: My pain?<br>
SYBOK: It runs deep. Share it with me.<br>
(Sybok boldly enters the shaft and embraces his evil twin)<br>
KIRK: Enterprise, ...are you ready?<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise-A bridge]</b>
<p>
SULU: Enterprise. Torpedo armed.<br>
CHEKOV: But Captain, we're firing directly on your position.<br>
<p>
<b>[Sha Ka Ree crater]</b>
<p>
KIRK: Send it down Mister Chekov. ...Now! ...Run!<br>
<p>
<b>[Sha Ka Ree crater ridge]</b>
<p>
SPOCK: Sybok?<br>
KIRK: Let's get out of here.<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise-A bridge]</b>
<p>
UHURA: Sulu, I've lost them.<br>
(the unheeded warning about the Klingon ship is still on the screen)<br>
<p>
<b>[Copernicus]</b>
<p>
KIRK: Spock, get us out of here!<br>
SPOCK: Thrusters are inoperative.<br>
KIRK: Mister Scott.<br>
SCOTT: Scotty here, Captain.<br>
KIRK: Please tell me the transporter is working.<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise-A transporter room]</b>
<p>
SCOTT: She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.<br>
<p>
<b>[Copernicus]</b>
<p>
KIRK: Beam up Spock and Doctor McCoy now. Do it!<br>
McCOY: Now, just a damned minute...<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise-A transporter room]</b>
<p>
SPOCK: Thank you Mister Scott. Bring up the Captain.<br>
SCOTT: Aye sir.<br>
(the Bird-of-Prey fires disabling both the Enterprise and Copernicus transporters and Kirk flees out onto the planet)<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise-A bridge]</b>
<p>
McCOY: What about Jim? We can't just leave him down there.<br>
SPOCK: Please get a grip on yourself, Doctor. Status report.<br>
UHURA: Klingon captain wishes to name his terms, Mister Spock.<br>
SPOCK: On screen.<br>
KLAA (on viewscreen): This is Captain Klaa of the Klingon Empire. Do not attempt to raise shields or arm weapons or I will destroy you. You are alive for a single reason. The renegade James T. Kirk! Hand him over and I will spare your lives. My transporter stands ready to beam him aboard.<br>
SPOCK: Captain Kirk is not among us.<br>
KLAA (on viewscreen): You lie!<br>
SPOCK: I am a Vulcan. I'm incapable of lying. Captain Kirk is on the planet below.<br>
KLAA (on viewscreen): Then give me his co-ordinates!<br>
SPOCK: General, I am in need of your assistance.<br>
KORRD: My assistance?<br>
SPOCK: You are his superior officer.<br>
KORRD: I'm a foolish old man.<br>
SPOCK: Damn you, sir, you will try!<br>
<p>
<b>[Bird-of-Prey in space]</b>
<p>
SPOCK (OC): Klingon Commander. Someone wishes to speak with you.<br>
(on the planet Kirk climbs to the highest peak while the malevolent being threatens him. Suddenly there is a burst of firing, from the Bird-of-Prey)<br>
<p>
<b>[Sha Ka Ree summit]</b>
<p>
KIRK: So it's me you want, you Klingon bastards. ...What are you waiting for?<br>
(Kirk disappears in a Klingon transporter beam)<br>
<p>
<b>[Bird-of-Prey transporter room]</b>
<p>
(two Klingons take Kirk to the bridge)<br>
KORRD: Release him! ...Kirk, my junior officer has something he wants to say to you.<br>
KLAA: I ...apologise. ...The attack upon your vessel was not authorised my government.<br>
KORRD: Now may I present our new gunner?<br>
KIRK: Spock!<br>
SPOCK: Welcome aboard, Captain.<br>
KIRK: I ...thought I was going to die.<br>
SPOCK: Not possible. You were never alone. ...Please, Captain. Not in front of the Klingons.<br>
<p>
<b>[Enterprise-A forward observation room]</b>
<p>
SCOTT: Would you care for a wee nip of scotch whisky?<br>
KORRD: Umm.<br>
SCOTT: I never thought I'd ever be drinking with a Klingon.<br>
(St. John Talbot and Caithlin Dar are talking together)<br>
KORRD: And what are you two conspiring about?<br>
TALBOT: We are just thinking how far we've come in such a short space of time.<br>
KORRD: We certainly have.<br>
(Vixis enters followed by Sulu and Chekov)<br>
CHEKOV: She has wonderful muscles.<br>
KIRK: Cosmic thoughts, gentlemen?<br>
McCOY: We were speculating ...'Is God really out there?'<br>
KIRK: Maybe He's not out there, Bones. Maybe He's right here ...in the human heart. ...Spock?<br>
SPOCK: I was thinking of Sybok. I have lost a brother.<br>
KIRK: Yes. ...I lost a brother once. But I was lucky, I got him back.<br>
McCOY: I thought you said men like us don't have families.<br>
KIRK: I was wrong.<br>
<p>
<b>[Yosemite campsite]</b>
<p>
KIRK: Are you going to pluck that thing or are you going to play something?<br>
McCOY/KIRK/SPOCK: 'Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream...' '...merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream...'<br>
