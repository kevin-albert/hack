Somewhere, in that totality known as the universe, is a galaxy called
the Milky Way. Tucked into the corner of that galaxy is a planet named
Earth. On that planet is a city called Mantua. Go straight ahead past
the fountain, turn right, then left, then right again. You'll find
yourself walking along the water, listening, as a man sings of his
beloved's unfaithful heart. And even the fish begin to weep. Quando, la
donna e mobile. (singing) La donne e mobile, qual piuma al a vento,
muta d'accento, e di pensiero. Sempre un'amabile, leggiadro
viso,&nbsp;in pianto o in riso, e mensognero. La donna e mobile,
qual pium al vento, &nbsp;muta d'accento, e di pensier. &nbsp;E
di pensier. <br>
(Tuvok is weeping.)<br>
PARIS: Tuvok? <br>
EMH: E di pensier! <br>
(Tuvok starts laughing, then falls to his knees.)<br>
PARIS: Tuvok! <br>
(Paris goes to help and gets pushed away.)<br>
JANEWAY: Janeway to Security. Get a team to the mess hall right away. <br>
EMH: Stand back. He's been seized by the pon farr. A neurochemical
imbalance is driving him to mate. We won't be able to reason with him.
(singing) Tuvok, I understand. You are a Vulcan man. You have just gone
without for seven years about. Paris, please find a way to load a
hypospray. I will give you the sign. Just aim for his behind. Hormones
are raging, Synapses blazing, It's all so veeee (Paris gets an
emergency medkit and loads the hypospray, then throws it to the EMH
whilst he is holding the note.)<br>

Doctor? Hello? <br>
(The EMH ends his daydream and returns to his work.)<br>
TORRES: Maybe I'd better run a diagnostic on your hearing subroutines. <br>
EMH: My hearing's fine. I was just letting my mind wander, that's all. <br>
TORRES: If you're not working on anything, you should deactivate
yourself. Save us the energy. <br>
EMH: Wait a second, I thought I was scheduled to go on the away team. <br>
TORRES: Well, the planet looks safe on the long range sensors. Any
medical problems, and we can use the transporter. But, take a look at
those scans and see if there's anything we might have missed. <br>
EMH: Lieutenant, I wanted to go on the away team. There's a canyon on
that planet I'd like to investigate. <br>
TORRES: I've already handed out assignments. Next time. If you'd like,
I'll snap a few images for you. <br>

is a gaseous object on the viewscreen. Chakotay enters.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Where did that come from? <br>
JANEWAY: Good question. It didn't show up on sensors until a few
minutes ago. <br>
CHAKOTAY: T class nebula. A thousand kilometre diameter. Hydrogen,
helium, argon. <br>
JANEWAY: Nothing too dramatic. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If you want some drama, take a look at this. <br>
(He hands over a PADD.)<br>
JANEWAY: To Captain Kathryn Janeway, Starship Voyager. From Emergency
Medical Hologram, Starship Voyager. Topic, status of Emergency Medical
Hologram, Starship Voyager. <br>
CHAKOTAY: He's filing a formal grievance. <br>
JANEWAY: Regarding? <br>
CHAKOTAY: His treatment by the crew. There's also a paragraph about his
future on Voyager, and a proposal for his advancement. <br>
JANEWAY: Failure to acknowledge sentience. Rude behaviour. What's this?
A request to be made Captain in the event of a catastrophic emergency?
He's serious. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Dead serious and he wants a formal response, for the record. <br>
TUVOK: Protocol allows for Commander Chakotay or myself to address his
demands, if the captain would prefer. <br>
JANEWAY: No, I'll take care of it. I don't want anybody to be
uncomfortable on this ship. I guess we should all try to be more
considerate of his feelings. <br>
PARIS: Captain, he does it to himself. He's Chief Medical Officer. Is
it our fault that's not enough for him? <br>
JANEWAY: Resume course toward the planet. Chakotay, you have the
bridge. I've got a formal response to draft.

the nebula, a crew of neckless aliens in rubber suits are making notes.)<br>
OVERLOOKER: What category did I assign that vessel? <br>
PHLOX: Unacceptable risk. <br>
OVERLOOKER: Correct. And what was my justification for that decision? <br>
PHLOX: The ship appears in none of our databases. Initial attempts to
scan the interior failed. <br>
OVERLOOKER: Then why are you wasting our resources? <br>
PHLOX: I think I can penetrate the hull, using a microtunnelling
sensor. <br>
OVERLOOKER: And observe the interior one molecule at a time? There are
other potential targets that must be surveyed. <br>
PHLOX: If I could tap into a data transfer conduit, I'd be able to
reach their main computer core. That would tell me all we need to know
about their tactical systems, in theory. <br>
OVERLOOKER: We could be detected. They may not like being spied upon. <br>
PHLOX: I think I've been very careful avoiding it. I'll take every
precaution, I promise. <br>
OVERLOOKER: Unacceptable risk. <br>
PHLOX: I've already transmitted my proposal to the Hierarchy. They
should be responding momentarily. <br>
OVERLOOKER: Do you have something you'd like to say? <br>
DEVRO: No. <br>
OVERLOOKER: The Hierarchy cannot be bothered with every ill-conceived
notion that you <br>

PHLOX: They've approved. I'd better get started. <br>

PHLOX: Huh. Acceptable risk. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TORRES:
The layer of antonium runs right along the edge of the canyon. <br>
SEVEN: My scans show geological instability within one hundred metres
of the target location. <br>
PARIS: I could put the Flyer down just outside of that. <br>
NEELIX: I don't know, Tom. That might be a little too far. <br>
PARIS: What's the matter, Neelix? Afraid of a little exercise? <br>
TORRES: I think we could handle a hundred metre stroll. <br>
PARIS: I have to agree. <br>
(The EMH gets a message on his PADD - Dinner Tonight? He looks up and
Seven winks at him.)<br>
NEELIX: Maybe getting there. It's coming back I'm worried about. We'll
be loaded down with ore. If the ground is unstable <br>
SEVEN: I suggest limiting the team members to twenty kilograms.
Preliminary scans indicate the crust is dense enough to support that
weight. <br>
(Then Janeway gets up and walks around the table, brushing her hand
along the back of the EMH's seat. Seven stiffens.)<br>
PARIS: You might try carrying a transport enhancer to the site. <br>
NEELIX: That's not a bad idea. We'll beam the ore back to the Delta
Flyer and we won't have to carry anything. <br>
TORRES: You know, this mission is starting to look a little more
dangerous than we thought. Maybe we do need the Doctor to come along.
If one of us fell through the crust there could be injuries. <br>
(The EMH gets another text message - Resist.)<br>
SEVEN: I require his assistance in Astrometrics. <br>
TORRES: What for? <br>
SEVEN: That's none of your business. <br>
TORRES: I think it is. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh! <br>
(Janeway leans over the table by the EMH, holding her back.)<br>
NEELIX: What's wrong, Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: It's nothing, really. An old Academy injury. It flares up
every now and then. I've learned to live with it, but maybe you should
stay here and have a look. Right there. <br>
(Janeway places the EMH's hand on the sacral area of her lower back.
Torres stands.)<br>
TORRES: Get away from him. <br>
JANEWAY: You are dismissed. Doctor? Doctor? <br>
(The EMH is roused from his reverie.)<br>
EMH: Yes, Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: Let's talk about these demands of yours.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Ready
room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
I've given you a great deal of freedom on this ship. <br>
EMH: I'm not disputing that. <br>
JANEWAY: But you're not satisfied, either. <br>
EMH: I should be allowed to participate and advance according to my
abilities, like any other member of this crew. <br>
JANEWAY: You should also know your limits. <br>
EMH: My programme can be expanded indefinitely. I don't have limits. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe, but we all have primary responsibilities. Yours is
Sickbay. <br>
EMH: I'm a computer programme. Multiple tasking is second nature to me.
<br>
JANEWAY: This proposal of yours to be made a, what? What did you call
it? <br>
EMH: ECH. Emergency Command Hologram. <br>
JANEWAY: In principle, it's an interesting idea. A backup captain in
case I'm incapacitated and the command structure breaks down. But
expanding your programme would take months of work. <br>
EMH: The lives of the crew may depend on it someday. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm afraid the answer's no, Doctor. However, as part of my
formal response I have recommended that Starfleet assign a team of
Engineers to consider your proposal. When we get back to the Alpha
Quadrant, I'll pass it along. <br>
EMH: Thank you, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Thank you, Doctor. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The EMH
walks into a Congratulations ECH Party. His PADD has morphed into a
glass of champagne.)<br>
JANEWAY: Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce the Emergency

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Overlooker

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The
party is on a monitor.)<br>
PHLOX: I've tried to access their internal sensors, but I couldn't get
past the security encryption. So, I found something even better. A
holographic crewman. I've tapped into his cognitive subroutines. We can
now monitor everything he's experiencing. <br>
DEVRO: It's like having an agent on board. <br>
JANEWAY [on screen]: To the ECH. <br>
EMH [on screen]: Captain, this is such an honour, but if you don't mind
my saying, hardly a surprise. <br>
(A little later.)<br>
PHLOX: Allow me to introduce the Doctor. He's a computer programme, a
sentient piece of holographic technology. And he is Voyager's medical
officer. <br>
OVERLOOKER: Voyager? <br>
PHLOX: That's the name of the ship. I've only been observing the Doctor
for a matter of hours, and I've already learned more about this vessel
than I did in three days of sensor sweeps. <br>
OVERLOOKER: Elaborate. <br>
PHLOX: The reason Voyager is not in our database is because they are
not from this quadrant. They're lost. Alone. <br>
OVERLOOKER: No backup vessel? <br>
PHLOX: Uh huh.<br>
OVERLOOKER: No one to contact for help? <br>
PHLOX: Precisely. Another few hours of observation and I will know all
we need to know about them. Defences, weapons, crew complement,
everything. <br>
OVERLOOKER: From monitoring one individual? Unlikely. <br>
PHLOX: Actually, it is very likely. The social structure on Voyager is,
is much different than ours. <br>
OVERLOOKER: How so? <br>
PHLOX: This is my observation post. I have a single function. But the
Doctor does much more than just practice medicine. He has access to the
entire ship, and he seems to be an expert on everything. In fact, the
Captain just gave him authorisation to command the bridge! It was a
very exciting moment. <br>
OVERLOOKER: Why aren't you monitoring him now? <br>
PHLOX: The link drops out intermittently, but it should be
re-established in a few minutes. <br>
OVERLOOKER: Maintain your surveillance.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH:
This'll take care of any potential allergens in the planet's
atmosphere. I'll monitor your medical status from the bridge, but I
don't anticipate any problems. Since I'm not going, I wonder if you'd
mind snapping a few holo-images for me while you're down there. <br>
NEELIX: Gladly. <br>
EMH: Tell me something, Mister Neelix. Do you daydream? <br>
NEELIX: On Talaxia, we have a saying. The dream dreams the dreamer. <br>
EMH: Care to translate? <br>
NEELIX: We like to think that fantasies and daydreams come from
someplace else. Another land. They slip into our minds and whisper
about things we never imagined. <br>
EMH: A strange notion. <br>
NEELIX: Do you daydream, Doctor? <br>
EMH: Of course not. I'm a computer programme. I prefer wide shots,
Mister Neelix. If you're feeling creative, throw in a little
ultraviolet.<br>

avoid a direct confrontation with him. I recommend a type three stealth
assault. <br>

OVERLOOKER: Your survey indicated large quantities of both. We've
already committed substantial resources to mounting this assault. Were
you mistaken? <br>
PHLOX: No, not at all. I'm just sounding a note of caution. <br>
OVERLOOKER: If our boarding party doesn't find Voyager exactly as
you've described it, the Hierarchy will be informed. <br>
PHLOX: I understand. There has been no mistake. <br>
OVERLOOKER: Then we'll proceed. <br>
(The Overlooker walks away.)<br>
PHLOX: I've made a terrible mistake. <br>
DEVRO: How terrible? <br>
PHLOX: The Doctor was appearing in a different location every few
seconds. It didn't seem possible, so I investigated a little further
and I haven't been monitoring his perceptions, I've been watching his
dreams, or his, his imaginings. I'm not sure which. But none of this is
real. What am I going to do? </font></p>

I came to check on your patient. <br>
EMH: He's doing just fine, Captain. It took Lieutenant Torres half the
night to stabilise my matrix, but I haven't had a single flight of
fancy since. I apologise for altering my programme
without permission. <br>
JANEWAY: At least there wasn't any permanent damage. <br>
EMH: I'm afraid there was. I've been exposed, humiliated. Turned inside
out for all the world to see. If I've lost your respect<br>
JANEWAY: That will never happen. Certainly not because we've seen a few
random fantasies. We all daydream, Doctor. It helps us imagine other
possibilities in life. Just hold off until we've figured out a way for
you to do it without damaging yourself, all right?

change? <br>
JANEWAY: In a way. Not for me, though. I've been going over the legal
precedents for granting command positions to holograms. There aren't
any. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, this ship needs its Doctor. He should focus on what
he was programmed for. Medical care. <br>
JANEWAY: I think we've underestimated him because of our own human
limitations. His full potential's unknown, Chakotay. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Would you be comfortable handing over your ship to a computer
programme? <br>
JANEWAY: Well, I don't know if I'd take it that far. <br>

PHLOX: You didn't. I'm transmitting a simulation of myself into your

EMH: Doctor to the bridge. I'm daydreaming again. Somebody deactivate
me. <br>
PHLOX: Voyager is about to be attacked. <br>
EMH: Of course it is, unless the valiant Doctor swings into action,
right? <br>
PHLOX: Yes, yes, precisely. <br>
EMH: A common theme in all my fantasies. <br>

(He gives her his glass of champagne and she moves on.)<br>
EMH: Why? <br>
PHLOX: It was the only way for me to communicate with you. <br>
EMH: I'm listening. <br>
PHLOX: I'm a long range observer on an assault class vessel. I scan
passing ships for technology and raw materials. When I find an
acceptable target, we raid it. <br>
EMH: You've been spying on us. <br>
PHLOX: More to the point, on you. For several days I've been using a
long range
tunnelling sensor to tap into your programme. You were supposed to be
our eyes and ears on Voyager. Instead, I got this. <br>
EMH: My daydreams? You tapped into my daydreams? That's why my
algorithms have been destabilising. <br>
PHLOX: My fault. I'm sorry. <br>
EMH: Tell me about this attack. <br>
PHLOX: My ship is less than an hour away. I can help you avoid a
confrontation but you must do exactly what I say. <br>
EMH: Why should you want to help us? <br>
PHLOX: You don't understand. The Hierarchy does not tolerate mistakes
or misinformation. If they learn of my error, I'll lose my livelihood. <br>
EMH: Well, that's what you get for being a Peeping Tom. <br>
PHLOX: But I also care about what happens to you. I feel like I've got
to know you over the past few days. <br>
EMH: You've been spying on my fantasies, not me. You don't know me at
all. <br>
PHLOX: But I do. I know how your mind works, what your hopes are. You
created all these possibilities. My species, we're very different. Our
thinking is confined but, I can't help but admire you. I don't want you
to be harmed. <br>

Captain, we're about to be attacked. Alien vessels are approaching. <br>
PARIS: There's nothing on the sensors, Doc. <br>
EMH: The vessels are cloaked. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How do you know this? <br>
EMH: One of the aliens contacted me. <br>
TUVOK: I've detected no transmissions. <br>
EMH: He spoke to me in a daydream. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't want to hear it. However, I would like to know why
you've disobeyed my direct order. <br>
EMH: I can prove it to you. The alien told me how to reconfigure our
sensors to compensate for their cloaking field. <br>
&nbsp;(The EMH hands a PADD to Kim. Janeway nods okay.)<br>
KIM: He's right. I'm picking up three ships out there. Distance six
hundred million kilometres, headed right for us. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. Maximum magnification. <br>
EMH: The alien won't help us unless we help him. <br>
PARIS: What if this is all part of their attack? A ruse? <br>
CHAKOTAY: He's already helped us compensate for their cloak. I'm
inclined to believe him. <br>
JANEWAY: So am I, but I'd just as soon set a course away from here at
maximum warp. <br>
EMH: That will only delay a confrontation. They have vessels hidden
throughout the entire sector. <br>
JANEWAY: Did your friend have a plan? <br>
EMH: He said they're running what's called a type three stealth
assault. They won't decloak until they're right on top of us, at which
point they'll fire a warning shot across our bow. Then come the demands
for supplies and technology. If we don't comply, they'll destroy us.
Fortunately, the alien promised to transmit the resonance frequencies
of their phasers. <br>
TUVOK: And in return? <br>
EMH: In return. He mistakenly informed his superiors that I was in
command of Voyager. To keep himself from being demoted, he wants us to
maintain that fiction. When they open the channel, I have to be sitting
in the Captain's chair. I'm sorry, Captain, but he insisted. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, I guess it's time to turn fantasy into reality. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: I'm
in over my head. What if I fail? <br>
KIM: You sound like I did when the Captain put me in command of the
night shift. That chair looked so big I thought I'd sink so far into it
that nobody would be able to see me. <br>
EMH: But you had your Academy training to fall back on. <br>
KIM: Yeah, well, sounds like you've had plenty of practice. <br>
EMH: That wasn't real. <br>
KIM: Listen, Doc. The whole reason you wanted to be able to daydream
was to test out possibilities, right? Consider this a field test. </font></p>

Why isn't there any hull damage from the Borg attack? <br>
PHLOX: They repaired it. <br>
OVERLOOKER: So quickly? Hmm. Prepare for type four assault. <br>
PHLOX: Type four? That would cause a huge drain on our energy core. A
waste of resources. Do you really think that's necessary? <br>
OVERLOOKER: What I think doesn't matter. Your long range surveillance
indicated an attack by Borg. On closer inspection, that appears to be
doubtful. Your report on this vessel could be mistaken. I think caution
is in order. The Hierarchy agrees. Proceed to type four.
