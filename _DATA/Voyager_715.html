TORRES: Thank you, I'm sure she'll
love it. What is it? <br>
TUVOK: A pleenok. Vulcans use them to train their infants in primary
logic. <br>
PARIS: Never too early to train those synapses, eh, Tuvok? Let me see that.
I love a good puzzle. <br>
NEELIX: This one's from Mister Kim. <br>
TORRES: Starfleet diapers. <br>(Disposable nappies with the Starfleet logo on them.)<br>
KIM: Standard issue. <br>PARIS: Well, we know who to call if there's a containment breach.<br>(Seven is fully human here, too.)<br>
JANEWAY: Now that your Borg implants have been removed, you might think
about having children of your own one day.<br>
SEVEN: One day. I have been considering some less radical changes in my
personal life. <br>
JANEWAY: Such as? <br>
SEVEN: I realise I don't have a rank, but I would like to request a
uniform. <br>
JANEWAY: Consider it done. The Doctor tells me you don't need to
regenerate any more. I can arrange some quarters for you, unless you
enjoy curling up in the Cargo Bay. <br>
SEVEN: A bed would be more comfortable. Since I arrived on Voyager,
your guidance has been invaluable. Thank you, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: All I did was chart the course. You're the one who made the
journey. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Seven, it's traditional for everyone to share their best
wishes for the baby. I thought you might like to start. <br>
SEVEN: To the newest member of our crew. May all her desires be
fulfilled except for one, so she'll always have something to strive
for. <br>JANEWAY: Very good.<br>
ALL: Hear, hear. <br>(Paris is struggling with the pleenok. He has it in pieces and cannot get it back together again.)<br>
SEVEN: And may she inherit a sense of logic from her mother. <br>

That was strange. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Care to explain? <br>
PARIS: I wish I could. Long range sensors picked up an energy
discharge, but now it's gone. There. There's another one. <br>
TUVOK: They're occurring approximately five point nine light years
ahead. <br>

wasn't able to find the cause of the discharges, but the region ahead
contains unusual amounts of subspace radiation and metallic debris. <br>

SEVEN: Not within range. But I'll have more data once we move closer. <br>
JANEWAY: I see no reason to alter course. Keep an eye on your sensors. <br>
SEVEN: Yes, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Now, on to more pressing matters. Does B'Elanna suspect
anything? <br>
PARIS: Not a clue. <br>
JANEWAY: Good. Mess hall, fourteen hundred hours, be on time. I don't
want to spoil the surprise. I expect both of you to show up. <br>
SEVEN: I'll be busy here. <br>
PARIS: What's wrong, Seven? No baby showers in the Collective? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm sure you can spare a few minutes. <br>(Janeway and Paris leave.) <br>
TUVOK: If it's any consolation, I share your discomfort with social
gatherings. <br>
SEVEN: They seem to occur with alarming frequency. <br>
TUVOK: Mister Neelix would argue that they improve morale. <br>
SEVEN: I have been looking for ways to improve my social skills.
Perhaps I'll attend. </font></p>

- Seven's quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Human Seven in her Starfleet uniform, standing in an empty room.)<br>NEELIX:
Well, it certainly is efficient. No clutter, plenty of room to move
around. But it's a little impersonal, don't you think? <br>
SEVEN: Explain. <br>
NEELIX: Well, these are your quarters, Seven. They should reflect your
individuality. How about a table and a couple of chairs? Give yourself
a place to work, entertain guests. Try to add a little colour.
Photographs, artwork, knick-knacks. <br>
SEVEN: Knick-knacks? <br>
NEELIX: Little things, like the wood carvings in Ensign Kim's quarters.
<br>
SEVEN: I've never been to Ensign Kim's quarters. But I suppose I could
replicate some items and disperse them throughout the room. <br>
NEELIX: That's a start. Some people like to display pictures of family
and friends. <br>
SEVEN: There's a photograph of my parents in the ship's database. I'll
make a copy and place it in a frame. <br>
NEELIX: Good, good. <br>
SEVEN: A multispectral star chart might enhance this bulkhead. <br>
NEELIX: Or a painting. <br>
SEVEN: A painting of a star chart. <br>
NEELIX: I was thinking of something more abstract, more artistic.
Drapes. Nothing livens up a room like good window dressing. Not to
mention the added privacy. <br>
SEVEN: Privacy? We're in space. <br>
NEELIX: You never know when we'll be docking at a crowded space
port. But we'll have to make sure that they match the carpet. I'm
thinking of a Talaxian mosaic. Tulaberry blue stripes with an orange
inlay. <br>
SEVEN: I appreciate your aesthetic insights, but I believe I can
proceed on my own. <br>(Doorbell)<br>SEVEN: Enter. <br>(Chakotay is carrying a bag.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Am I interrupting? <br>
SEVEN: Please come in. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Love what you've done with the place. <br>
SEVEN: We're in the process of decorating. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe this will help. Consider it a housewarming gift. <br>(Chakotay hands Seven a traditional netted loop of wood with dangling feathers.)<br>NEELIX: It's beautiful. What is it? <br>
SEVEN: A dream catcher. According to Native American mythology, it wards
off nightmares. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm impressed. <br>
SEVEN: I've familiarised myself with your culture. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Now that you'll be sleeping instead of regenerating, I
thought it might come in handy. <br>
SEVEN: I'm sure it will. Thank you. <br>
NEELIX: I'll let you two find a place to hang that, but it would look
perfect right above the bed. Pleasant dreams. <br>(Neelix leaves.) <br>
SEVEN: It was thoughtful of you to stop by. <br>
CHAKOTAY: On move in day? I wouldn't miss it. <br>
SEVEN: I suppose this makes you my inaugural guest. I'd be a negligent
host if I didn't offer you a beverage. Tea? <br>
CHAKOTAY: That might be difficult. No replicator. <br>
SEVEN: Another flaw in the decor. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'll requisition one for you first thing tomorrow. <br>
SEVEN: I'd appreciate that, Commander. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay. We're off duty. We can drop the formalities.<br>
SEVEN: Yes, sir. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I enjoyed your toast today. You've come a long way. I hope to
see more. <br>
SEVEN: You will. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Good night. <br>
SEVEN: Chakotay. As you might know I've taken an interest in culinary
science. I'm preparing a meal tomorrow night, and I thought perhaps you
could attend to evaluate my work. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'd be happy to. <br>
SEVEN: Nineteen hundred hours? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'll bring the wine and the furniture. <br>

(sings) Rock-a-bye baby, in the space dock. When the core blows, the
shuttle will rock. When the hull breaks, the shuttle will fall. And
down will come baby, shuttle and all. <br>
SEVEN: Are you trying to soothe the infant, or traumatise her? <br>
EMH: The lyrics are rather grim, but it's the melody they respond to. I
recorded twenty nine in all, including a couple of Klingon lullabies.
My favourite is 'quong vaj Ocht. Sleep, little warrior. I could tell by
the look on their faces that my gift made quite an impression. <br>
SEVEN: No doubt. <br>
EMH: I wish you'd been there. It was a lovely shower. Tom and B'Elanna
were disappointed that you didn't attend. <br>
SEVEN: I was occupied. <br>
EMH: Are you experiencing any shoulder pain? <br>
SEVEN: Yes. <br>
EMH: Hmm. Your biradial clamp is out of alignment by point three
microns. I'm afraid it will have to be repaired. <br>
SEVEN: Can't you simply extract the component? <br>
EMH: Not if you want to keep using that arm. I know it's an
inconvenience, but until we can find a way to remove your cybernetic
systems, they'll have to be maintained. It's a minor procedure. We might
as well take care of it now. <br>
SEVEN: I prefer to wait. <br>
EMH: We'll be done in an hour. <br>
SEVEN: I have research to complete. <br>
EMH: Oh. I suppose we can put it off until next week's physical. I also
noticed that your electrolyte levels are down by twelve percent. Have
you missed any regeneration cycles? <br>
SEVEN: Last night. <br>
EMH: Don't tell me. More research? This must be some project. Mind if I
ask what you're working on? <br>
SEVEN: It's complicated. <br>
EMH: How do you mean? <br>
SEVEN: My personal life is none of your concern. <br>
EMH: I wasn't aware you had a personal life.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Report.<br>
PARIS: It was an energy discharge, two hundred thousand kilometres
starboard. <br>
TUVOK: It produced a level nine shockwave. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Some kind of weapon? <br>
TUVOK: Possibly. <br>
PARIS: Another one, five million kilometres to port. <br>
TUVOK: A shockwave is approaching. <br>
JANEWAY: Full power to the shields. <br>(The shockwave hits them broadside on.)<br>
KIM: Our warp field's destabilising. <br>
TUVOK: I'm detecting another. Distance, fifty thousand kilometres. <br>
JANEWAY: Turn our bow into the wavefront. It'll minimise the damage. <br>
PARIS: Sorry, Captain. There wasn't enough time. <br>
KIM: We've lost warp drive. <br>
TUVOK: I'm reading another. Distance, twenty six million kilometres.
Too far to pose a threat. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If they are weapons, they don't seem to be directed at us. <br>
JANEWAY: Or whoever's firing them is a lousy shot. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Astrometrics
lab]</b>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
Astrometric sensors recorded the explosions. I believe it's a
long range subspace warhead. The debris in this region suggests that
dozens have been fired in the last several weeks. <br>
TUVOK: The warhead destroyed something. What was it? <br>
SEVEN: It appeared to be an unmanned probe. <br>
JANEWAY: This is all very intriguing, but I'd just as soon get out of
here before we cross paths with another one of these things. Where do
we stand on repairs? <br>
TUVOK: Subspace radiation from the explosions is making it difficult to
create a stable warp field. Lieutenant Torres estimates forty eight
hours. <br>
JANEWAY: Can you find a way to detect the warheads before they emerge
from subspace? <br>
SEVEN: I believe so. The weapons create minor gravimetric distortions
as they approach the subspace barrier. But I need to recalibrate my
sensors to isolate the effect. <br>
JANEWAY: Do it. Even a few seconds' warning would help us. <br>
SEVEN: Yes, Captain. <br>(Later, Icheb enters.)<br>SEVEN:
Your duty shift doesn't begin for two hours. <br>
ICHEB: The Doctor sent me to relieve you early. He wants you to spend
more time regenerating. <br>
SEVEN: I see he's enlisted an ally. <br>
ICHEB: Don't kill the messenger.&nbsp;Sophocles, Oedipus Rex. I've been
studying Earth literature as a part of my Academy training. <br>
SEVEN: Continue these scans of the subspace barrier. Look for any
gravimetric distortions. <br>

the warp core for the fifteenth time. <br>
SEVEN: Perhaps this will enhance your day. It's a belated gift for your
baby shower. I apologise for my absence. <br>

grease. Thinking about a new look? <br>

few myself. It sounds intriguing, your new gravimetric array. When this
crisis is over I'd be happy to take a look. Maybe I can lend a hand. </font></p>

I've analysed the sensor data from that last barrage. I've refined your
detection method. We'll be able to see the weapons ten point three
seconds earlier. <br>
SEVEN: The Captain will be pleased. <br>
ICHEB: Have I offended you? <br>
SEVEN: No. You've done nothing wrong. I was negligent in my duties. As
a result, Voyager was nearly destroyed. I was hoping you could provide
a quotation to help alleviate my guilt. <br>
ICHEB: I, I can't think of one, but I'd be happy to search the database.
<br>
SEVEN: That won't be necessary. Stay here until I return. <br>

Computer, activate Chakotay simulation. (Doorbell.)<br>SEVEN: Come in. <br>(Chakotay enters with flowers and a plate under a cover.)<br>
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: I hope you're not allergic. Antarian moon blossoms,
extremely rare. I had to smuggle them out of Airponics. Don't tell
Neelix. I thought I'd cook for you tonight. How does roasted chicken
sound? I slaved over the replicator for hours. Not hungry?<br>
SEVEN: I called you here to thank you. <br>
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: For what? <br>
SEVEN: The past few days have been memorable. <br>
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: To say the least. You're ending this. <br>
SEVEN: In a manner of speaking, yes. <br>
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Why? <br>
SEVEN: Our relationship is interfering with my responsibilities on
Voyager. <br>
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: I could speak to the Captain, have her cut back on your
duty shifts. Seven, the past few days have been more than memorable.
They've been an important step forward for both of us. Don't throw that
away. <br>
SEVEN: I'm sorry, Commander. <br>
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: You're making a mistake. <br>
SEVEN: No, I'm trying to correct one. <br>
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Ask yourself why you want to end this. Is it out of a
sense of duty, or something else? Every time you move closer to your
emotions, you back away. Like hiding behind that metronome.<br>
SEVEN: Your analogy is flawed. <br>
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Is it? I think you're afraid that embracing your
humanity will make you weak, less than perfect. But think about what
you stand to gain. <br>
SEVEN: It's irrelevant. <br>
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: No, it's not. Real intimacy with another person?
Nothing's more relevant. <br>(Seven hears the little noise again.)<br>
SEVEN:&nbsp;I must return to my station. <br>
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: Stay here with me. <br>
SEVEN: This ship needs me. <br>
HOLO-CHAKOTAY: So do I. <br>(That sound again.)<br>

Commander? <br>
EMH: If you're looking for your other holographic friend, he's offline
at the moment. Your cortical node began to shut down. Fortunately, I
managed to stabilise it before there was any permanent damage. <br>
SEVEN: It was functioning properly when you examined me two days ago. <br>
EMH: I'm going to run a diagnostic on your entire cortical array, but
it might help if I knew what you were doing before you collapsed. Did
you suffer a physical injury of some kind? <br>
SEVEN: No. <br>
EMH: Were you exposed to any unusual radiation? <br>
SEVEN: No. <br>
EMH: What exactly were you doing in there? <br>
SEVEN: Research. <br>
EMH: That simulation of Commander Chakotay mentioned that the two of
you were having an argument. Was that part of your research? I couldn't
help but notice that you'd created some quarters for yourself. A new
dress, dinner for two. <br>
SEVEN: I trust you'll respect doctor-patient confidentiality. <br>
EMH: Of course. <br>
SEVEN: I've been conducting simulations to explore different aspects of
my humanity. <br>
EMH: Such as? <br>
SEVEN: Social activities, friendships with the crew, intimate
relations. <br>
EMH: I take it our First Officer is your romantic interest.<br>
SEVEN: Commander Chakotay seemed like an appropriate choice. He has
many admirable qualities. <br>
EMH: So he does. What prompted all this? <br>
SEVEN: Unimatrix Zero. I've been trying to recreate some of the
experiences I had there. Ever since it was destroyed, my life has
seemed incomplete. I wanted to feel those emotions again. <br>
EMH: Well, this is encouraging. You might be ready to start forming
deeper relationships. I'm proud of you, Seven. <br>
SEVEN: Your pride is misplaced. I intend to delete the programmes. <br>
EMH: Why? <br>
SEVEN: I can no longer perform my duties efficiently. My personal life
has become a distraction. <br>
EMH: It's supposed to be a distraction. You simply have to find the
right balance between work and recreation. <br>
SEVEN: Inform me when you finish the diagnostic. <br>

its target and locked onto our warp signature. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
Doctor. You've come to deliver unpleasant news. <br>
EMH: Is it that obvious? I've completed my diagnostic. What you
experienced was no malfunction. Your cortical node was designed to shut
down your higher brain functions when you achieve a certain level of
emotional stimulation. <br>
SEVEN: Clarify. <br>
EMH: It appears to be a fail-safe mechanism to deactivate drones who
start to regain their emotions. Knowing the Borg, it makes perfect
sense. Finding one's heart is the surest road to individuality. <br>
SEVEN: I'm no longer linked to the hive mind. <br>
EMH: The technology's built into your node. It simply remained dormant,
until now. <br>
SEVEN: Can you repair me? <br>
EMH: Possibly. I've been thinking about a way to reconfigure the
micro-circuitry. I won't lie to you, Seven. It would entail multiple
surgeries, and the recovery might be difficult. But I believe we could
eventually succeed. I'll prepare the surgical bay. We can begin
tomorrow morning. <br>
SEVEN: No. <br>
EMH: Without the procedure, you won't be able to continue your
simulations. <br>
SEVEN: I've experienced enough humanity for the time being. They were
only holographic fantasies, Doctor. An inefficient use of my time. <br>
EMH: You don't really believe that. <br>
SEVEN: The fail-safe device will insure that I'm no longer distracted.<br>
EMH: That's the Borg talking, not you. As your physician. As your
friend, I'm asking you to let me proceed. <br>
