We'll take it under advisement, Doctor. Thank you for your efforts.
Janeway out. What do you think? <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's risky. The Vidiians have never shown any willingness to
help us. It's more likely they'd attack Voyager and try to harvest body
parts from the crew. <br>
JANEWAY: Agreed. I just want to make sure we're not overlooking a
possible alternative. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TORRES:
So we're just going to abandon them on this planet? <br>
TUVOK: Those were Captain Janeway's express orders. <br>
PARIS: But you're captain now. You can rescind them. <br>
TUVOK: To what end? <br>
TORRES: I can't believe we haven't been able to find a cure for an
insect bite. <br>
KES: The Doctor hasn't deactivated himself for a month. He's tried
everything. He searched every database, attempted the most drastic
research. You can't fault him. <br>
NEELIX: I can tell you, the morale of the crew is going to suffer if we
leave them behind. <br>
TUVOK: Not if, Mister Neelix. When we leave them behind. The decision
has been made. We will of course, provide them with everything they'll
need for their survival and comfort. I am arranging for a modular
shelter to be transported to the surface. They'll have all the
technology they need. Weapons, tricorders, a replicator. <br>
TORRES: You talk as though it were a camping trip. They have to spend
the rest of their lives down there. <br>
TUVOK: That is not a certainty. Captain Janeway intends to continue
researching the virus. She is an able scientist, and may eventually be
able to effect a cure. They have a type nine shuttlecraft at their
disposal if it becomes possible for them to leave the planet. <br>
PARIS: Type nine shuttlecraft has a top speed of warp four. It won't
take them more than, oh, about seven hundred years to get home. <br>
TUVOK: I'm not certain what it is you expect me to do, Lieutenant. <br>
PARIS: I guess clearly something you can't do, which is to feel as
rotten about this as we do. <br>
TUVOK: You are correct that I am unable to experience that emotion. And
frankly, I fail to see what the benefit would be. If there is nothing
more, you are all dismissed.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY
[OC]: Janeway to Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: Yes, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: We've received the transport. We'll check it over and let
you know if we're missing anything. <br>
TUVOK: I will remain in orbit until I hear from you. And after that, we
can still remain in communication for approximately thirty six hours.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
I'll contact you before the day is over. Janeway out. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It looks like they transported the contents of the whole
ship. <br>
JANEWAY: We may have to be here for a while. Petri dishes, protein
analyzer, DNA sequencers. Everything I need for my research is here. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Do you really think you can find a cure? <br>
JANEWAY: It may take a while but yes I do. If I can find a specimen of
the insect that infected us, I can begin analysing protein cofactors.
That might give us the information we need to find out what it is in
this environment that's keeping us from being sick and how to replicate
it. <br>
(Chakotay takes a shelter piece from the module.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Does it matter which way these things go? <br>
JANEWAY: I guess it depends whether you're in a beige mood or a grey
mood. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's not much of a choice. Couldn't Starfleet have come up
with something a little more cheerful? <br>
JANEWAY: Like polka dots? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I was thinking more of a tasteful pinstripe, something in
blues and greens. Well, I suggest we put the grey on the outside and
the beige inside. <br>
JANEWAY: I like that. I've always looked better in beige. Actually, it
might be kind of interesting, roughing it for a while. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Roughing it? Let's see, we have shelter, furniture, research
equipment, tricorders, a replicator. It's too rough for me. <br>
JANEWAY: We don't have a bathtub. <br>
CHAKOTAY: A bathtub? <br>
JANEWAY: I love a bath. It's my favourite way of relaxing. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, I'm sure you can learn to love the sonic shower. <br>
JANEWAY: You know, Chakotay, it occurs to me, we aren't exactly in a
command structure anymore. Maybe you should call me Kathryn. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Give me a few days on that one, okay?

Academy cadet. There are mistakes. It's incomplete. <br>
SWINN: I'm sorry, Lieutenant. I guess I've been distracted. <br>
TORRES: We've all been distracted, Ensign. That's no excuse. <br>
SWINN: Yes, ma'am. <br>
TORRES: I can't get anything done here. Nobody can concentrate. <br>
KIM: I know how they feel. <br>
TORRES: I'm not feeling so terrific myself, but I don't let that get in
the way of my work. <br>
KIM: B'Elanna, I've been talking with some of the Starfleet crew.
They're not happy about what happened. I was wondering, how are the
Maquis taking it? <br>
TORRES: How do you think they're taking it? This isn't a Starfleet
issue, Harry. It's affecting everyone. <br>
KIM: Then why don't we do something about it? <br>
TORRES: Do what? <br>
KIM: I don't know. It seems like we shouldn't just accept this. <br>
TORRES: Well, that's all well and good, but frankly, I can't think of
anything else we can do. If you have any ideas, I'll listen. Otherwise,
I think we should take a deep breath and move on.

JANEWAY: Just the same ones as yesterday, and they don't seem to carry
the pathogen that's infected us. Where have you been? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Oh, in the woods. <br>
JANEWAY: For the past two days, you've been spending a lot of time in
the woods. Is something going on I should know about? <br>

me? <br>

JANEWAY: Janeway here. <br>
TUVOK [OC]: We're about to move out of communications range. How are
you faring? <br>
JANEWAY: We're doing quite well. I'd like to speak to the crew now. <br>
TUVOK [OC]: Your comm. link has been put through to the entire ship. <br>
JANEWAY: This is Kathryn Janeway. I've never liked saying good bye, so
I'll make this brief, but I want you all to know that serving as your
captain has been the most extraordinary experience of my life.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY
[OC]: No captain could ask more than what this crew has given. Bravery,
compassion and strength of character. But I think what I'll miss most
is the fun. The times we joked together, the games on the holodeck.
I'll remember the laughter more than anything. Although Commander
Chakotay and I won't be with you for the rest of your journey, we know
that you'll be the same steadfast crew for Mister Tuvok as you have
been for us. We wish you a safe and a speedy journey home. Our thoughts
will be with you.

long and prosper.

CHAKOTAY [OC]: No, I left an hour ago. <br>
JANEWAY: I was thinking. Maybe looking for protein cofactors is the
wrong approach. Even if I can't find a specimen of the insect that
infected us, I could try to learn something about the bio-molecular
evolution of this planet's ecosystem.

(He grabs a phaser and flashlight, and runs outside.) <br>
JANEWAY: Over there. It looks like some kind of primate. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I've detected primate life signs here, but I've never seen
one. <br>
JANEWAY: Hello. Are you hungry? Is that why you came here? I'm Kathryn,
he's Chakotay. We've had to move into your neighbourhood, but I hope we
can be friends. <br>

treatment for this disease. <br>
JANEWAY: Yes? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You've been at it twelve hours a day, seven days a week since
we got here, and we're still no closer to a cure than we were the day
we were infected. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm not sure what you're getting at. <br>
CHAKOTAY: My people have a saying. Even the eagle must know when to
sleep. Maybe it's time we both considered that. <br>
JANEWAY: You mean quit, give up? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Why do you have to see it as defeat? Maybe it's simply
accepting what life has dealt us, finding the good in it. <br>

a long way from it right now. I need to keep looking.

TUVOK: Distance? <br>
KIM: Approximately one point five light years. <br>
TUVOK: Lieutenant, alter course to a different heading. I don't want to
risk their detecting us. <br>
KIM: Sir, the Vidiians. <br>
TUVOK: Yes? <br>
KIM: They're within hailing range. We could ask them if they know
anything about the Captain's illness. <br>
TUVOK: You're aware that Captain Janeway specifically told us not to
risk contacting the Vidiians. <br>
KIM: Yes, but it's not like we went out of our way to find them. We
would just be taking advantage of an opportunity that's presented
itself. <br>
TUVOK: That bit of sophistry is not terribly persuasive, Ensign. <br>
KIM: Sir, how can we turn our backs on this chance to do something?
Don't we have to try? Don't we owe that to the Captain and the
Commander? <br>
TUVOK: The matter is closed, Ensign. Return to your station. <br>
KIM: What's wrong with the rest of you? You know I'm right. <br>
TUVOK: Ensign Kim. <br>
KIM: We have a chance to help them. How can we ignore that? <br>

shift this morning? <br>
KIM: Yes, sir, but this is important. <br>
TUVOK: Very well. <br>
KIM: First of all, I want to apologise for my behaviour yesterday. <br>
TUVOK: Apology accepted. I understand that this is a difficult
situation for you. <br>
KIM: I'd like to suggest a plan. It's something a lot of people have
helped to develop. We have two big bargaining points when it comes to
dealing with the Vidiians. First, there's the woman Doc treated, Denara
Pel. They were very close, so I'm sure she'd help us if she could. And
then there's B'Elanna. Her DNA might lead to a cure for the phage. We
could offer them some, in exchange for their help with a cure for the
Captain and Chakotay. <br>
TUVOK: Those are, as you say, points in our favour. But there is also
the fact that we were recently responsible for the destruction of a
Vidiian ship, an act which killed over three hundred of their people.
That alone makes it unwise for us to contact them. <br>
KIM: Sir, I think you should know how many people on this ship disagree
with you. Everyone I talk to thinks we should give this a try. <br>
TUVOK: The people you talk to do not have the responsibility of
commanding this vessel. I do. The safety of this crew is paramount, and
I must do whatever I can to ensure that safety. <br>
KIM: But if we're willing to take that risk in order to help the
Captain <br>
TUVOK: Ensign, I'm going to say this once and once only. If you ever
question my orders again, you will be relieved of duty permanently. The
next words I expect to hear from you are yes sir. <br>

things to make our lives easier here. The cooking, for example. I hate
to cook. <br>
CHAKOTAY: But what I do makes you uncomfortable, doesn't it? Every time
I do something that adds a personal touch to the shelter, you resist

focused on making a home here instead of finding a cure that will let
us leave. <br>

never happen. The reality of this situation is that we may never leave

threatening situation. In general, I believe it demonstrates faulty
leadership to be guided by the emotions of a distraught crew. However,
as Captain, I must not ignore the sensibilities of those I command. We
will contact the Vidiians. This is my decision and mine alone. You are
all absolved of responsibility in the matter. I will accept any
consequences which may ensue. Lieutenant, set a course for the Vidiian
convoy. Mister Kim, let me know when we're within hailing range. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM:
Sir, the Vidiians are hailing us. <br>
TUVOK: On screen. <br>
DENARA [on viewscreen]: Hello, Lieutenant. <br>
TUVOK: Dr. Pel. I didn't expect to see you this quickly. <br>
DENARA [on viewscreen]: When I heard what happened, I boarded the first
ship I could. Tell me about this illness. <br>
TUVOK: They were infected by a virus after being bitten by insects on a
planet approximately seventy light years from here, in a system with a
yellow dwarf star. <br>
DENARA [on viewscreen]: The third planet in a system of seven? <br>
TUVOK: Yes. <br>
DENARA [on viewscreen]: I know it well. There's a particular kind of
burrowing insect that carries the disease. Years ago, we developed an
anti-viral agent to combat it. <br>
TUVOK: Can we get some from you? <br>
DENARA [on viewscreen]: Of course. Our captain said we could rendezvous
with you. He's transmitted the coordinates. <br>
KIM: I have them, sir. <br>
TUVOK: Thank you, Doctor. We appreciate your help. <br>
DENARA [on viewscreen]: I'm glad I can be of assistance. <br>
TUVOK: Estimated time to the coordinates? <br>
KIM: Approximately twenty hours. <br>
TUVOK: Until then, I want a series of battle drills. We must be ready
for whatever comes.

up.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: I've been thinking. There's plenty of wood available here. I
could probably add rooms to the shelter, give us a little more living
space. <br>
JANEWAY: How would you mill it? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I could do a certain amount with a phaser, but I was actually
thinking of logs. <br>
JANEWAY: As in log cabin? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I built a few of them when I was growing up. My father
thought it was important that I learn how. <br>
JANEWAY: When I was young, my parents took us on backpacking trips.
They thought we should all keep a connection to our pioneer roots. I
hated it. No bed, no replicator. <br>
CHAKOTAY: No bathtub. <br>
JANEWAY: No bathtub. I guess I was always a child of the twenty fourth
century. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Well, maybe those camping trips helped prepare you for life
here. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, no. Life here is much better than that. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I think that's the first time I've heard you say anything
positive about being here. <br>
(The primate chatters at them.) <br>
JANEWAY: Well, hello there. I haven't seen you in a while. Where have
you been? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Do you expect him to answer you? <br>
JANEWAY: Not really. I just sense intelligence in him, and I could
swear he came to warn me about the plasma storm. Come here, fellow.
Come on. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I doubt that he can be domesticated, at least not very
easily. <br>
(The primate climbs a tree.) <br>
JANEWAY: Well, we have plenty of time. The rest of our lives. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's a long time. At least I hope so. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, I can't give you orders anymore but I suggest we get
back to work. <br>

JANEWAY: Oh, that feels good. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I've had a lot of practice at this. My mother used to get
sore necks all the time. I was the only one she'd trust not to make it
worse. <br>
(After a very long moment, Janeway stands up.) <br>
JANEWAY: That's much better. Thank you. Well, I'm going to go to bed

JANEWAY: We have to talk about this. <br>
CHAKOTAY: All right. <br>
JANEWAY: I think we need to define some parameters about us. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm not sure I can define parameters. But I can tell you a
story, an ancient legend among my people. It's about an angry warrior
who lived his life in conflict with the rest of his tribe, a man who
couldn't find peace, even with the help of his spirit guide. For years,
he struggled with his discontent. But the only satisfaction he ever got
came when he was in battle. This made him a hero among his tribe, but
the warrior still longed for peace within himself. One day he and his
war party were captured by a neighbouring tribe led by a woman warrior.
She called on him to join her because her tribe was too small and weak
to defend itself from all its enemies. The woman warrior was brave and
beautiful and very wise. The angry warrior swore to
