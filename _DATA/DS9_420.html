O'BRIEN: Try one. You'll like it. <br>
KEIKO: Too early for me <br>
O'BRIEN: You sure? <br>
KEIKO: It's so sweet. <br>
O'BRIEN: It's a natural sweetness from the sap of the jumja tree. It's
full of vitamin C. <br>
KEIKO: Since when did you become such an expert on jumja sticks? <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh, Neela told me. <br>
KEIKO: Did she? So, is she working out any better than the last one? <br>
O'BRIEN: Who, Neela? She's terrific. She's even taught me a thing or
two. <br>
KEIKO: I'm glad to hear her expertise doesn't end with jumja sticks . <br>
O'BRIEN: No, she's a good engin (penny drops) Hold on. <br>
KEIKO: What? <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, you're not thinking? Well, Keiko. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEIKO: Now, as we discussed in yesterday's lesson,
the wormhole was discovered by Commander Sisko and Lieutenant Dax
earlier this year. Does anyone know what makes this wormhole so
unusual? Jake? <br>
JAKE: It's stable? <br>
KEIKO: It's stable. That's right, Jake. It's the first stable wormhole
known to exist. <br>
(A Bajoran religious woman enters) <br>
WINN: Please, continue. <br>
KEIKO: A stable wormhole is very important because it allows us to
travel secure in the knowledge that neither end will shift locations.
Who knows why the wormhole is stable? Because it was artificially
constructed. Commander Sisko encountered the entities who created the
wormhole when he <br>
WINN: Excuse me. By entities, do you not mean the Prophets? <br>
KEIKO: Yes, on Bajor the entities are worshipped as prophets. Our
studies of the wormhole have shown that it was formed by unique
particles we call verterons that are apparently self-sustaining in
nature. This begins to explain how a ship at impulse can safely pass
through <br>
WINN: Ships are safely guided through the passage by the hands of the
Prophets. <br>
KEIKO: In a manner of speaking. <br>
WINN: Not apparently in your manner of speaking. <br>
KEIKO: Perhaps we should discuss this after class. <br>
WINN: Do you believe the Celestial Temple of the Prophets exists within
the passage? <br>
KEIKO: I respect that the Bajoran people believe that it does. <br>
WINN: But that's not what you teach. <br>
KEIKO: No, I don't teach Bajoran spiritual beliefs. That's your job.
Mine is to open the children's minds to history, to literature, to
mathematics, to science. <br>
WINN: You are opening the children's minds to blasphemy, and I cannot
permit it to continue.

NEELA: I did it exactly like you showed me. Should I test it? <br>

KEIKO: You knew this was going to happen? <br>
SISKO: A confrontation like this was inevitable. Sometimes I wonder if
we'll ever find the common ground we need to bring Bajor into the
Federation. <br>
(He opens the office doors.) <br>
SISKO: Major, would you join us? <br>
(Kira enters) <br>
SISKO: We've been talking about an incident this morning at school. <br>
KIRA: I heard. Vedek Winn has been meeting with some of the Bajoran
civilians about it. <br>
SISKO: What do you know about her? <br>
KIRA: She's from an orthodox order. She has some support to become the
next Kai. Probably not enough. <br>
KEIKO: The question is, how much support does she have on this station?
<br>
KIRA: She has mine. <br>
KEIKO: You can't possibly believe teaching the facts about the wormhole
amounts to blasphemy? <br>
KIRA: I think some revisions in the school curriculum might be
appropriate. You teach a lot of Bajoran children. <br>
KEIKO: I'm not going to let a Bajoran spiritual leader dictate what can
or can't be taught in my classroom. <br>
KIRA: Then maybe we need two schools on the station. One for the
Bajoran children, another for the Federation. <br>
SISKO: If we start separating Bajoran and Federation interests <br>
KIRA: A lot of Bajoran and Federation interests are separate,
Commander. I've been telling you that all along. <br>
SISKO: Nobody's saying that there can't be spiritual teaching on this
station, Major, but can't it be in addition to what's taught in Mrs
O'Brien's classroom? <br>
KIRA: But if she's teaching a fundamentally different philosophy <br>
KEIKO: I'm not teaching any philosophy. What I'm trying to teach is
pure science. <br>
KIRA: Some might say pure science, taught without a spiritual context,
is a philosophy, Mrs O'Brien. <br>
SISKO: My philosophy is that there is room for all philosophies on this
station. Now, how do you suggest we deal with this? <br>
KIRA: I'm not sure you can.

doesn't turn around.) <br>
WINN: I can't tell you how much I've looked forward to this moment. I'm
honoured to meet the Emissary to the Prophets. <br>
SISKO: If you'd let me know you were coming, Vedek Winn, I would have
greeted you sooner. <br>
WINN: I did not wish to bother you with my insignificant visit. <br>
SISKO: I'd hardly call it insignificant. <br>
WINN: Thank you, Emissary. <br>
SISKO: I wish you wouldn't call me that. I'm Commander Sisko or
Benjamin, if you like. <br>
WINN: But you are the Emissary. Don't you know the cherished place you
have earned in the Bajoran spiritual life? <br>
SISKO: I'm not sure I'm comfortable in that role. <br>
WINN: The course the Prophets choose for us may not always be
comfortable. But we must follow it. <br>
(She reaches for his ear) <br>
WINN: May I? (takes hold) Still the disbeliever. I once asked Kai Opaka
why a disbeliever was destined to seek the Prophets, and she told me
one should never look into the eyes of one's own gods. I disagreed. I
told her I would do anything to look into their eyes. She suggested
that I sit in darkness for a day and quite properly so. She cannot be
replaced and I miss her deeply. <br>
SISKO: It's important to me that we resolve your problems with the
school. <br>
WINN: The prophets have spoken to me through the orbs, Emissary. I
understand my duty to defend the Bajoran faith. The teacher has
dishonoured the Celestial Temple. If she does not recant, I cannot be
responsible for the consequences.

trouble to go through to find one tool. <br>
O'BRIEN: With that interlock, someone could access every critical
system on the station. <br>
DAX: Chief, have you seen Ensign Aquino recently? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, now that you mention it. <br>
DAX: He didn't report for duty this morning. The computer says he's not
on the station, but he didn't log out. <br>
O'BRIEN: Have you talked to Odo? <br>
DAX: I guess I'd better. <br>

NEELA: Scanners are ready. <br>
O'BRIEN: Computer, show location of any independent tritanium sources. <br>
NEELA: Level three, section five. <br>
O'BRIEN: That's the tool locker. I've been through everything in there
three times. What's that? <br>
NEELA: Looks like something in a power conduit on level twelve, section
eight. <br>
O'BRIEN: What would tritanium be doing in there? Computer, shut down
that conduit. Reroute power flow. <br>
COMPUTER: Conduit deactivated. <br>

(There's molten metal on the floor) <br>
O'BRIEN: That's a tritanium composite, all right. Looks like our
missing interlock. <br>
NEELA: It must have been melted by the conduit's plasma flow. <br>
O'BRIEN: That still doesn't explain how it got here in the first place.
Hey, I'm picking up traces of organic material. Whatever it was, it's
been pretty well cooked by this conduit. Let's take a sample to Doctor
Bashir, see what he can make of it.

he disappeared about some sort of plasma flow irregularity in the
conduit. He indicated he was going to fix it. <br>

human.

in for a transfer and <br>

O'Brien now. <br>
KEIKO: Good morning. <br>
WINN: Are you Mister O'Brien? <br>
O'BRIEN: That's right. <br>
WINN: A pleasure to meet you. I've just been hearing many wonderful
things about your wife from the parents of these children. She
apparently is an excellent teacher. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, she is, and she doesn't deserve what you're doing to her.
<br>
WINN: I feel your anger toward me, and I forgive you for it. Mrs
O'Brien, if I've misjudged you, I am terribly sorry. Have I? Is there a
place in your school for the Prophets? <br>
KEIKO: No. <br>
WINN: I admire you for standing by your convictions even though I
disagree with them. Please believe me, I want to find a way to allow
these children to stay in your school. <br>
KEIKO: I'm sure the children and their parents are happy to hear you
say that. <br>
WINN: Let me be the one to make the first concession. I will no longer
request that you teach anything about the Celestial Temple. Just don't
teach anything about the wormhole at all. <br>
KEIKO: Ignore it? <br>
WINN: Find other ways, other things to teach the children. <br>
KEIKO: And when we get to theories of evolution or creation of the
universe, what then? <br>
WINN: We'll face those issues when we come to them. <br>
KEIKO: I'm a teacher. My responsibility is to expose my students to
knowledge, not hide it from them. The answer is no. <br>
WINN: I've tried to be reasonable. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: If Aquino turned off the conduit to fix the
relay, why did it reactivate. <br>
O'BRIEN: The Cardassians only equipped those power conduits with one
flow regulator per level. The computer could've realigned it. When the
power flow was rerouted back, it could've caught him inside. <br>
DAX: You don't sound entirely convinced. <br>
O'BRIEN: No, it all adds up only, well, I don't know. <br>
SISKO: Spit it out, Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN: He borrowed one of my tools without asking. <br>
KIRA: It was four in the morning. Maybe he didn't want to disturb you. <br>
O'BRIEN: The repairs could've waited. He was a Starfleet engineer. You
don't take a Chief's tools without asking. It's unheard of. <br>
ODO: Are you suggesting it might not have been an accident? <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't know what I'm suggesting. I only know what I know. He
should've asked. <br>
SISKO: Constable, maybe you ought to take a closer look into this.
Dismissed. Hi. <br>
JAKE: Can I talk to you for a minute. <br>
SISKO: Sure. I heard about what happened at school. Did Mrs O'Brien
call off classes? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Commander's office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JAKE: No. There was only me and four other kids
left, but she still kept the school open. She changed the lesson to
teach us about Galileo. Did you know that he was tried by the
Inquisition for teaching that the Earth moved around the sun? <br>
SISKO: Tried and convicted. His books were burned. <br>
JAKE: How could anyone be so stupid? <br>
SISKO: It's easy to look back seven centuries and judge what was right
and wrong. <br>
JAKE: But the same thing is happening now with all this stuff about the
Celestial Temple in the wormhole. It's dumb. <br>
SISKO: No, it's not. You've got to realise something, Jake. For over
fifty years, the one thing that allowed the Bajorans to survive the
Cardassian occupation was their faith. The Prophets were their only
source of hope and courage. <br>
JAKE: But there were no Prophets. They were just some aliens that you
found in the wormhole. <br>
SISKO: To those aliens, the future is no more difficult to see than the
past. Why shouldn't they be considered Prophets? <br>
JAKE: Are you serious? <br>
SISKO: My point is, it's a matter of interpretation. It may not be what
you believe, but that doesn't make it wrong. If you start to think that
way, you'll be acting just like Vedek Winn, Only from the other side.
We can't afford to think that way, Jake. We'd lose everything we've
worked for here <br>
JAKE: You're worried, aren't you? What're you going to do? <br>
SISKO: I'm not sure, but I think I've got to find some help.

SISKO: Vedek Bareil? <br>
(Sisko leans forward.) <br>
BAREIL: No need to pay tribute to me. <br>
SISKO: Pay tribute? I was just. Usually when I meet one of Bajor's
spiritual leaders, the first thing they do is grab my <br>
BAREIL: Ear? It's unpleasant, isn't it? <br>
SISKO: I've been far too polite to admit it. <br>
BAREIL: I was five the first time one of the monks grabbed my ear. He
was a stern old crow who could virtually squeeze the pagh out of you
with his thumb and forefinger, and as a chronic misbehaver I was his
favourite victim. I swore one of my life's goals would be to do away
with that archaic ritual. <br>
SISKO: You can count on the Federation's support. <br>
BAREIL: I hope you don't mind if I do a little planting while we talk.
All those hours of listening to a hundred and twelve vedeks talking at
once made me yearn for the sanctity of my arboretum. <br>
SISKO: Is this yours? <br>
BAREIL: I began my service at the monastery as the gardener. I had no
other ambition but to grow the most lovely Feloran
bromeliads on the planet. Unfortunately, the Prophets did not allow me
that peaceful life. I understand my friend Vedek Winn has brought her
blessings to your station. <br>
SISKO: I was hoping you might be able to arrange an audience with the
Assembly so I could discuss our school. <br>
BAREIL: Why me? <br>
SISKO: You are the leading candidate to become the next Kai. Your
ideology is quite different than Vedek Winn's. <br>
BAREIL: You have been correctly informed. I'm sorry, Commander. The
Vedek Assembly will not see you. <br>
SISKO: Why not? <br>
BAREIL: Some fear you as the symbol of a Federation they view as
godless. Some fear you as the Emissary who has walked with the
Prophets. And some fear you because Vedek Winn told them to. We're all
very good conjuring up enough fear to justify whatever we want to do.
Today, I am only a Vedek. If the Prophets will it, someday I may be
Kai, and I can be a better friend to you then. <br>
SISKO: In other words, being my friend now might hurt your chances. <br>
BAREIL: The Prophets teach us patience. <br>
SISKO: It appears they also teach you politics. <br>

KIRA: Everyone knows if the Federation leaves the Cardassians will be

primary reason the Federation is here and it's not why I'm here. I'm

Aquino you should see. <br>
BASHIR: Sir, I've finally managed to reconstruct the victim's DNA. It's
definitely Aquino, but the power flow in the conduit didn't kill him.
You see, the plasma disruption in his cellular membranes indicates that
he was exposed to a directed energy discharge before he was placed in
the conduit. <br>

unfortunately, none of them have taken credit for the death of the
Starfleet officer. Sorry. <br>
O'BRIEN: (calling from the upper level) Odo! <br>
ODO: Keep your ears open. <br>
QUARK: Are you kidding? That's the seventh rule of acquisition. <br>
(Quark leaves, O'Brien comes down the stairs) <br>
O'BRIEN: This is a security bypass module. <br>
ODO: You found it at runabout pad C? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, that's just it. It wasn't at pad C. That was clean as a
whistle. Just to be safe, I ran a diagnostic across the board. This
showed up at runabout pad A. <br>
ODO: Pad A. <br>
O'BRIEN: Aquino never went anywhere near pad A. It doesn't make sense. <br>
ODO: On the contrary, it makes perfect sense. Ensign Aquino goes to
runabout C because some sensor shows an anomaly in the security net
there. He interrupts whoever is tampering with it and is killed. The
killer puts the body in the conduit and instead of going back to pad C,
which might be traced with Aquino's turbolift log, he changes his plan
and moves to pad A. <br>
O'BRIEN: But what was the plan? Everything else seems normal. <br>
ODO: I'd guess somebody wanted to steal a runabout. <br>
O'BRIEN: We're not missing any. <br>
ODO: It's curious. He goes to a lot of trouble to defeat the security
net and then doesn't go through with <br>

WINN: Where is Mrs O'Brien? <br>
SISKO: Her husband took her home. <br>
WINN: Was she hurt? Was anyone hurt? <br>
SISKO: No. <br>
WINN: The Prophets have been kind today. <br>
SISKO: The Prophets had nothing to do with what happened here today.
This was the work of a disturbed and violent mind who listened to your
voice, not the Prophets. <br>
WINN: Is the Emissary holding me responsible for this act of terrorism?
<br>
SISKO: The Commander of this station is. <br>
WINN: May the Prophets forgive you for abandoning them. <br>
SISKO: You claim the Prophets as your personal constituency, Vedek
Winn. I'm not convinced that's justified. Who do you speak for? An
order that is barely listened to in your Assembly. So you come here
looking for a more receptive audience. <br>
WINN: Is that what your friend Vedek Bareil told you? He's as misguided
as you are. No, that's not fair. You are not simply misguided as I once
thought. Now I see that you want nothing less than to destroy us. <br>
SISKO: Destroy you? <br>
WINN: You live without a soul, Commander. You and your Federation exist
in a universe of darkness and you would drag us in there with you. But
we will not go. <br>
SISKO: You have just made your first mistake, Vedek. <br>
WINN: Have I? <br>
SISKO: The Bajorans who have lived with us on this station, who have
worked with us for months, who helped us move this station to protect
the wormhole, who joined us to explore the Gamma Quadrant, who have
begun to build the future of Bajor with us. These people know that we
are neither the enemy nor the devil. We don't always agree. We have
some damn good fights, in fact. But we always come away from them with
a little better understanding and appreciation of other. You won't
succeed here. The school will reopen. And when your rhetoric gets old,
the Bajoran parents will bring their children back. <br>
WINN: We'll see. <br>

classes tomorrow in one of the small cargo bays, if that's okay. <br>
SISKO: You tell her Jake'll be there on time. <br>
O'BRIEN: It'll make her feel a lot better to hear that, sir. <br>
SISKO: Anything new on Aquino? <br>
(Neela goes quietly to a console) <br>
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. I found a security bypass module at runabout pad A.
It looks like someone might have wanted to steal a runabout. That's
probably why Aquino went there in the first place. I've put security
seals in place at all three pads and I'm checking for any other
anomalies. <br>

board a Bajoran transport. <br>

invitation. <br>
SISKO: Invitation? <br>
BAREIL [on viewscreen]: You did invite me to tour your facility? <br>
SISKO: Yes, yes, of course, Vedek. We'd be honoured. Unfortunately, we
have some damage on our Promenade. We won't have time to clean up
before you arrive. <br>
BAREIL [on viewscreen]: Yes. I heard about it. Perhaps I can help you
clean it up. <br>
SISKO: That would be very much appreciated. <br>

to seeing you again.
