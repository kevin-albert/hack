<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(We're looking at a picture of a pastoral landscape
with some woodland and gently rolling hills.) <br>
SISKO: There are a few wild moba trees here, and a creek that runs
through the meadows and into the forest. <br>
(Sisko is showing the picture to Kasidy.) <br>
SISKO: Nice spot, huh? <br>
KASIDY: Bajor, right? <br>
SISKO: The Kendra province, just south of the Yolja river. I was there
the other day. <br>
KASIDY: I thought you went to a conference in Rakantha. <br>
SISKO: I did. But afterwards Vedek Oram wanted me to visit his
monastery. We took a transport across the mountains. The sun was just
going down and the entire valley was shimmering in the light. And I
said to myself, this is the place. This is where I'm going to build my
house. <br>
KASIDY: I've heard you talk that way before. <br>
SISKO: Oh, no, this is not just talk. As of this morning, all of this
land belongs to me. <br>
KASIDY: You're serious. <br>
SISKO: Twelve hecapates. I'm going to start building as soon as the war
is over. We'll have a place that we can visit any time we want. <br>
KASIDY: Sounds good to me. <br>
SISKO: Maybe someday I'll retire here. <br>
KASIDY: I could see you now, sitting in your rocking chair, watching
the sunset over the mountains every night, wondering where you put your
teeth. <br>
SISKO: Just like my great-great grandfather, in the glass next to the
chair. <br>
KASIDY: It's funny how thing's turn out, isn't it? <br>
SISKO: What do you mean? <br>
KASIDY: Did you ever think that you would become so attached to Bajor
that you'd want to spend the rest of your life there? <br>
SISKO: It wasn't part of the master plan, if that's what you mean. But
from the moment I set foot on this station, nothing has turned out the
way I imagined it. This was supposed to be just a temporary assignment,
but it has become much more than that. I guess I was meant to come
here. You see, it's almost like my <br>
KASIDY: Destiny. <br>
SISKO: Destiny, yes. <br>
KASIDY: I guess when your mother turns out to be part prophet or part
wormhole alien or whatever it is you want to call her, words like
destiny begin to mean something. <br>
SISKO: When I look at the picture of this woman with my father, I think
to myself, yes, that's Sarah, my mother. But she's not just a woman,
she's more than that. And when I look at myself in the mirror <br>
KASIDY: You don't just see a man. You see more than that. <br>
SISKO: Does it bother you? <br>
KASIDY: Do I act like it bothers me? <br>
SISKO: You're not answering my question. <br>
KASIDY: I guess when you first told me about Sarah, I was a little
surprised. <br>
SISKO: More than a little. <br>
KASIDY: All right, I was very surprised. But the more I thought about
it, the more I realised what an amazing thing it was. Is. <br>
SISKO: I'm glad you think so. <br>
KASIDY: I do. And, part prophet or not, you're still my Benjamin and I
love you.

O'BRIEN: Captain Boday? <br>
BASHIR: The Gallamite. Jadzia dated him. <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh. The toothy smile and the transparent skull? <br>
BASHIR: That's him. <br>
O'BRIEN: What's he doing on the station? <br>
EZRI: The Gallamites are supplying duranium for the war effort. <br>
BASHIR: Personally, I don't know what Jadzia ever saw in that man. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, his brains. <br>
BASHIR: Did he know who you were? <br>
EZRI: Not at first. <br>
BASHIR: But when he found out, I bet he laid on the charm. <br>
EZRI: You could say that. <br>
BASHIR: The man's insufferable. He's opinionated and arrogant. <br>
EZRI: And charming. <br>
BASHIR: If you say so. <br>
(Kira enters.) <br>
O'BRIEN: Something wrong? <br>
KIRA: We just got word from the Klingons. The Rotarran and the Koraga
were ambushed by a Dominion patrol near the Badlands. <br>
EZRI: Worf was commanding the Koraga. <br>
KIRA: It didn't make it. The Rotarran recovered six escape pods. Worf
wasn't aboard any of them.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUARK: Heard anything from the Defiant? <br>
EZRI: I talked to Benjamin this morning. He said that according to the
Koraga's crew, Worf was the last one to leave the bridge. No one knows
if he made it to the escape pod. <br>
QUARK: My money says he did. We haven't seen the last of that crazy
Klingon. <br>
EZRI: They've been searching for three days. <br>
QUARK: They'll find him. It's just going to take a while. You know what
it's like in the Badlands, there's a lot of sensor interference. <br>
EZRI: I should have gone with them. <br>
QUARK: And what would you be able to do that they can't? <br>
EZRI: Probably nothing, but it would be easier than just sitting here
waiting. <br>
QUARK: He'll be back before you know it. <br>
EZRI: You really think so? <br>
QUARK: Absolutely. The night before he went on patrol, he brought the
Koraga's crew in here and bought them three barrels of bloodwine. <br>
EZRI: And? <br>
QUARK: And he didn't pay the tab. Do you really think he'd go to
Sto'Vo'Kor owing me money? <br>
EZRI: He doesn't even like you. <br>
QUARK: Exactly. He couldn't enjoy the afterlife knowing I had something
on him. <br>
EZRI: Thanks, Quark.

CREWMAN [OC]: Ops to Lieutenant Dax. <br>
EZRI: Go ahead. <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: You have an incoming transmission from the Defiant. <br>
EZRI: Patch it through. What is it, Benjamin? <br>
SISKO [on monitor]: I'm afraid we're going to have to call off the
search. <br>
EZRI: You're giving up? <br>
SISKO [on monitor]: We don't have any choice. There are a dozen
Jem'Hadar ships closing on our position. <br>
EZRI: But what if he's out there somewhere? <br>
SISKO [on monitor]: Let's face it, the odds aren't good. We don't even
know if he made it off the Koraga. I'm sorry.

space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. <br>
WEYOUN: No. Divert them to the So'na outpost on Devos Two. <br>
DAMAR: Why? <br>
WEYOUN: We need their to help protect the new Ketracel white facility.
The Federation has been made aware of its location. <br>
DAMAR: Can't the So'na protect it? <br>
WEYOUN: Are you questioning my orders? That would be foolish. I wonder
what the Defiant was doing out there? <br>
DAMAR: Looking for survivors from the Koraga. <br>
WEYOUN: For that long? <br>
DAMAR: Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're
not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. <br>
WEYOUN: If you have something to say, Damar, say it. <br>
DAMAR: Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's
not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. <br>
WEYOUN: Their sacrifices won't be in vain. We will be victorious. <br>
(Damar knocks back a large glass of kanar.) <br>
WEYOUN: A bit early, isn't it? Even for you. <br>
DAMAR: Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. <br>
WEYOUN: The Founder prefers it that way. <br>
DAMAR: I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for
days. <br>
WEYOUN: Feel free to dress warmly. <br>
DAMAR: I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look
well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. <br>
WEYOUN: How can a god be ill? <br>
DAMAR: Maybe she's not a god. <br>
WEYOUN: Whether you believe the Founders are gods or not is irrelevant.
All they require from you is obedience. Now. The Founder wants a
subspace comm. link installed in her quarters. <br>
DAMAR: I'll see to it. <br>
WEYOUN: A secure channel, separately encoded and isolated from the main
communication array. <br>
DAMAR: Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? <br>

EZRI: They're coming in behind us. <br>
(Bang!) <br>
WORF: Transfer auxiliary power to aft shields. <br>
(Bang!) <br>
EZRI: Shields are down to thirty percent. <br>
WORF: I am taking us into the atmosphere. (Bang!) Their ships are not
designed for sub-orbital flight. <br>
(Bang!) <br>
WORF: They are pulling away. <br>
EZRI: Glad to hear it, but that last hit took out our starboard
thrusters. <br>
(Bang!) <br>
WORF: We are losing altitude. <br>
EZRI: I can't compensate. <br>
WORF: We must abandon ship. <br>
(They grab phaser rifles and rucksacks from the floor compartment.) <br>
WORF: Energise.

EZRI: That was a good call. <br>
WORF: We may be here several days. I will reconnoiter the area. Set up
a comm. link and try to contact the station. <br>
EZRI: Right. Where's the comm. unit? You didn't take one? <br>
WORF: I thought you did. <br>
EZRI: No. <br>

Ross to perform the ceremony? <br>
KASIDY: My mother would prefer for her daughter to be married by a
minister. But an Admiral's the next best thing. <br>
SISKO: That's good. I'll talk to him. <br>
KASIDY: About the guest list. I wanted to keep it small, just family
and friends. <br>
SISKO: That's fine by me. There's only room for thirty or forty people
in the wardroom. <br>
KASIDY: That just leaves the menu. <br>
SISKO: You mind if I ask Quark to do the catering? <br>
KASIDY: Just make sure he doesn't overcharge us. <br>
SISKO: I'll make sure I can cut a deal. Kasidy, what else do we need to
talk about? I have the feeling we're forgetting something. <br>
KASIDY: You tell me. You're the one who's been married before. <br>
SISKO: That's just it. It felt a lot more complicated before. <br>
KASIDY: People get carried away with weddings. I just want it to be
nice and simple. <br>

KASIDY: Who told you we were getting married? <br>
SAHGI: Everybody's talking about it. Can I be one of your dais bearers?
<br>
KASIDY: My what, honey? <br>
SAHGI: For the bridal procession. I know you can only choose fifty one
girls, but it would be such an honour for me. <br>
KASIDY: Well, er <br>
SAHGI: People are saying it's going to be the biggest wedding Bajor's
ever seen. <br>
KASIDY: They are? <br>
SAHGI: The Emissary's getting married. <br>

DAMAR: My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made
certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. <br>
DUKAT: I may have failed to reopen the wormhole, but I assure you I
have no regrets. You see, I've come to know the love of the Pah

a comm. unit from a tricorder and her badge when Worf comes in with a
dead animal over his shoulder.) <br>
WORF: Dinner. <br>
EZRI: Why'd you have to kill a defenceless animal. We have plenty of
field rations. <br>
WORF: I have been eating field rations for six days. I am sick of field
rations. <br>
EZRI: So you traipsed off into the jungle and phasered yourself
something to eat. <br>
WORF: I did not use a phaser. I used this. (a pointed stick.) <br>
EZRI: Oh, well that makes it all the more sporting. <br>
WORF: It took me hours to track this animal. And while doing so, I
could have easily been attacked by a predator myself. <br>
EZRI: Oh, spare me the one with nature speech. <br>
WORF: I killed it and now I am going to eat it. If you do not want any,
then have some more field rations. <br>
EZRI: Fine. <br>
WORF: Jadzia would have understood. <br>
EZRI: Oh, I thought we weren't supposed to talk about her. <br>
WORF: I was merely making an observation. Have you been able to boost
the comm. badge signal? <br>
EZRI: Not enough to get a message back to the station. I'll bet Jadzia
would've been able to do it. I was merely making an observation. <br>
WORF: Perhaps we should both refrain from making observations. <br>
EZRI: You're right. Let's just go about our business and exchange as
few words as possible. What is it about men? They either don't talk at
all, like you, or they talk too much, like Boday. <br>
WORF: Boday? The Gallamite? <br>
EZRI: We had dinner on the station before I left. <br>
WORF: I see. If he talks so much, why would you have dinner with him? <br>
EZRI: He's interesting. And he's got a good sense of humour. <br>
WORF: Tell me. Did Jadzia, did she and Boday? <br>
EZRI: I don't have to answer that question. <br>
WORF: She did. <br>
EZRI: Worf, she didn't even know you back then. <br>
WORF: I do not wish to hear your excuses. <br>
EZRI: My excuses? I'm not the one who slept with him. <br>
WORF: You had dinner with him. <br>
EZRI: Who are you angry with? Me or Jadzia? <br>
WORF: Both. <br>
EZRI: You know what? You're crazy. <br>
WORF: You could make anyone crazy. <br>
EZRI: Don't turn your back. Talk to me, you coward. <br>
WORF: Do not call me a coward. <br>
EZRI: I can't believe I'm stuck here with you. <br>
WORF: Perhaps you would rather be on the station with Captain Boday,
you sli'vak. <br>

EZRI: Actually, I think it happened last night. <br>
WORF: You do not regret what happened last night, do you? <br>
EZRI: Why do you say that? <br>
WORF: Jadzia explained to me that joined Trill are not supposed to
become involved with anyone they were intimate with in a previous life.
