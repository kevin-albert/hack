Captain's log, stardate 41255.6. After delivering a party of Earth
colonists to the Strnad solar system, we have discovered another Class
M planet in the adjoining Rubicun star system. We are now in orbit
there, having determined it to be inhabited as well as unusually
lovely. My first officer has taken an away team down to make contact
and they are in the process of returning to the ship.

PICARD: Riker says the planet's life forms are almost identical to us. <br>
TROI: He's very enthusiastic. <br>
(Crusher enters) <br>
CRUSHER: Captain? Sorry, Troi. <br>
TROI: The Doctor has something very important to tell you, Captain. <br>
PICARD: You've been talking about it for days. Shore leave for the
crew. <br>
CRUSHER: Establishing that colony has been exhausting for the entire
crew, Captain. We're not a supply vessel. Settling all those people has
been a strain on everyone. I'm tired myself. <br>
(Riker, Data and Yar enter) <br>
PICARD: Is it as good as your report suggests, Number One? <br>
RIKER: As per report, sir. Class M, Earth-like, beautiful. It will
startle you. <br>
CRUSHER: It sounds wonderful for the children. The holodecks are
marvellous, of course, but there's nothing like open spaces and fresh
air. <br>
TASHA: I've listed my report on their customs and laws, sir. Fairly
simple, common sense things. <br>
LAFORGE: They're wild in some ways, actually puritanical in others.
Neat as pins, ultra-lawful, and make love at the drop of a hat. <br>
TASHA: Any hat. <br>
PICARD: But the happiest report has its negatives. Let's start with
them, Number One. <br>
RIKER: There are none, sir. Not that any of us can find. <br>
DATA: But there is a problem here, sir. <br>
WORF: It's the faulty reading I reported, sir. <br>
DATA: I'm reading something off the starboard bow, but there is nothing
there. <br>
TASHA: Sensor technicians are working on it, sir. They've identified it
as a glitch in the system. <br>
PICARD: I take it you find no glitch at all in this planet, however? <br>
RIKER: No, sir. <br>
TASHA: If you approve shore leave, sir, we could start with a small
group. <br>
PICARD: Of course. Wesley? If we go down, I'd like you to join the away
team to evaluate this world as a place for young people to relax. <br>
WESLEY: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: If our scans and observations confirm the report, of course
I'll approve it. Let's hope it is not too good to be true.

themselves the Edo. Our away team, including Wesley Crusher, has beamed

LIATOR: Nice to see you again. <br>

TROI: Healthy sensuality, sir. I feel mainly friendship, and (looking
at Tasha) happiness. <br>
RIVAN: And I welcome this huge one. Oh, yes. <br>
WORF: (returning the hug) Nice planet. <br>
RIKER: Yeah. <br>
RIVAN: But you are a young one. I do not know your custom regarding
love. <br>
WESLEY: Er. I guess, whatever you usually do. <br>
(It's a very fleeting hug for the teenager) <br>
RIKER: There are others who would like to visit here, if you would give
us a limit on the numbers. <br>
LIATOR: Whatever pleases you. We can discuss it at the Council
Chambers. <br>
RIVAN: Shall we go there now or remain in play? <br>
RIKER: Play? <br>
RIVAN: At love. Unless you don't enjoy that. (to Worf) Perhaps you do? <br>
LIATOR: And you? (Troi blushes) Yes, I can see that you do. <br>
WESLEY: Maybe I should just go on ahead. <br>
RIVAN: Oh, this is unfair to him. We'll go to the Council Chambers.
You'll find young people your age there. <br>
WESLEY: Well, I can't make any promises. <br>
LIATOR: You don't have to. Our rules are simple. No one does anything
uncomfortable to them. <br>
RIVAN: Come! Our people will want to know you. <br>
LIATOR: Rivan, perhaps they can't run. <br>
WESLEY: Can't run? Sure we can run. Right, Commander? <br>
RIKER: That's the custom here, running. Lead the way. <br>

(A little globe of light passes through the shields, and the hull, and
the bulkheads) <br>
OFFICER: Intruder alert, sir. I don't show a location. <br>

with our people.
<br>
OFFICER: Intruder relays do show something. <br>
PICARD: Why has everything become a something, or a whatever? <br>
(The globe has arrived on the Bridge, and is face to face with Picard.
When it speaks, everything shakes) <br>
EDO: State the purpose. (it tones down) State the purpose of what you
have done. <br>
PICARD: I'm Captain Picard, commanding this Federation starship. <br>
EDO: State the purpose of your visit here. <br>
PICARD: We have sent down what we call an away team to make peaceful
contact here. <br>
EDO: Do you plan to leave life forms here? <br>
PICARD: No. We are merely visiting here. <br>
EDO: But you did more at the world you just left. Why have you left
your own life forms there? <br>
DATA: The colony we just planted, sir. <br>
PICARD: We found that world uninhabited. The life forms we left there
had, had sought the challenge. At least, that is the basic reason. Had
sought the challenge of creating a new lifestyle, a new society there.
Life on our world is driven to protect itself by seeding itself as
widely as possible. <br>
EDO: Do not interfere with my children below. <br>
(The globe goes over to Data) <br>
DATA: Captain, I do not understand how, but it is asking me if I was
constructed for information exchange. <br>
PICARD: If there is any way of finding out whatever is out there, Data.

RIKER: What about plain old basic sex? You must have some need for
that. <br>
WORF: Of course, but with the females available to me, sir, Earth
females, I must restrain myself too much. They are quite fragile, sir. <br>
RIKER: Worf, if anyone else had said that, I'd suspect he was bragging.

Liator) <br>
TASHA: That is extraordinary. <br>
WORF: Can I take a moment of your time, Lieutenant? <br>
TASHA: Yes, Worf, but you've got to hear this. Are you telling me that
there's no crime here whatsoever? No one breaks any laws? <br>
LIATOR: Once they did. Long, long ago there was much disorder. But not
now. <br>
TASHA: But I seen no sign of police. Those who enforce laws. <br>
RIVAN: Oh, we have very few. They are called Mediators. And they are
needed only in one place each day. <br>
LIATOR: The punishment zone. An area that's selected for a period of
time. <br>
TASHA: It's a completely random selection? <br>
LIATOR: No one but our Mediators know what place or for how long. We're
very proud of the wisdom of our ancestors. No person ever knows where
or when a zone will be. <br>
RIVAN: And so no one risks death. <br>
WORF: Death? <br>
RIVAN: by breaking any law. <br>
TASHA: Wait. Explain this. <br>
LIATOR: Only one punishment for any crime. <br>
WORF: Anyone who commits any crime in the punishment zone dies? <br>
LIATOR: The law is the law. Our peace is built on that. <br>
TASHA: Even a small thing? Such as ignoring the rule, keep off the
grass? <br>
RIVAN: Then no one breaks that rule. Who wants to risk execution? And
there's always a white wall or fence to remind anyone of a forbidden
area like that. <br>
TASHA: And just who tells visitors about these rules? <br>
WORF: We'd better find Wesley.

RIKER: I thought you reviewed their laws. <br>
TASHA: But they listed nothing about punishment. <br>
MEDIATOR: One moment, please. Is there a witness to this transgression?
<br>
BOY: But it was my fault. I threw the ball past him. <br>
MEDIATOR: We have a visible transgression, ample witnesses, and an
admission of guilt. And though it deeply pains us to do it, we must. <br>

MEDIATOR: Are you prepared for punishment? <br>
WORF: Punishment? If you mean what the others were talking about. <br>
RIKER: What punishment? Name it! <br>
MEDIATOR: Death, of course. Don't make it difficult for the boy. <br>

TASHA: It's a kind of syringe. <br>

MEDIATOR: But of course it is. Completely painless. The boy would have
felt nothing. But look at him now. You've frightened him. <br>

not know how you Earth people conduct law and justice, even if you
respect such things. <br>

ago. The tranquillity you see in our lives has been made possible by
our laws. <br>

we have learned to adjust to that. Perhaps your laws work as well. <br>

PICARD: No, not any longer. <br>
RIVAN: But you did once? <br>
PICARD: Unfortunately, yes. But since then <br>
RIVAN: But when you did, was it believed necessary to do so? <br>
PICARD: Some people felt that it was necessary. But we have learned to
detect the seeds of criminal behaviour Capital punishment, in our
world, is no longer considered a justifiable deterrent. <br>
LIATOR: So, we are not yet as advanced as they are. And since you are
advanced in other ways too, I suggest you use your superior powers to
rescue the Wesley boy. We will record him as a convicted criminal out
of our reach, an advanced person who luckily escaped the barbarism of
this backward little world. <br>
PICARD: Unfortunately, we have a law known as the Prime Directive. <br>
RIVAN: Riker has explained it to us. <br>

RIVAN: Because you are strangers, we are delaying enforcement of the
law. But we must act by sundown. <br>
PICARD: Then I have another question. While orbiting, while circling
high above your world, as we do, we have encountered a strange object.
A vessel perhaps. Have you any idea what it is? It's not entirely real.
At least, it's not completely solid. <br>
RIVAN: Do you mean God? <br>
PICARD: God? <br>
LIATOR: God is said to be somewhere up there, protecting us. <br>
PICARD: Exactly, exactly how would you describe God? <br>

also. <br>

RIVAN: It has appeared before. <br>
PICARD: Can you speak to it? Does it speak to you? <br>
TROI: Captain! <br>
(The vessel becomes even more visible) <br>
EDO [OC]: Return my child. <br>
CRUSHER: Return? <br>
TROI: It's coming toward us. <br>
PICARD: Picard to Transporter Room, come in. <br>
(He puts his comm. badge on Rivan) <br>
TROI: Yes, do that. But hurry! <br>
CRUSHER: It's still coming toward us. <br>
CHIEF [OC]: Transporter Chief to Captain. <br>
PICARD: One to beam down to away team location. Hurry! Engage!
Transporter Room. Urgent! Engage! <br>
(And Rivan is beamed away. The Edo vessel backs off) <br>
CRUSHER: It seems the Edo's god is very protective of its children. <br>
PICARD: I had no choice but to learn about that thing from her. I'm
sorry I had to. She was so frightened. <br>
TROI: It's understandable, sir. Sharing an orbit with God is no small
experience. <br>
PICARD: Let's go see your patient, Doctor. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRUSHER: What do you intend to do about my son? <br>
PICARD: He's being held safely until sundown. <br>
CRUSHER: When he faces execution! Although he's committed no crime,
certainly none that any sane and reasonable person would <br>
PICARD: You saw what that thing was about to do. <br>
CRUSHER: I apologise, sir, but this is very difficult for me. If he
were your son, you'd be as frightened <br>
PICARD: But I am. <br>
CRUSHER: Data is in Sickbay here. You'll find him able to talk to you.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MEDIC: He's checking out fine, Doctor. <br>
CRUSHER: Thank you. Finish it later, please. <br>
DATA: I was an excellent choice for them, Captain. They were able to
communicate with me quite. I was about to say quite easily, but there
was nothing easy about it. Fortunately, they stopped short of
overloading my circuitry. <br>
PICARD: You're saying they. It is a vessel of some sort. <br>
DATA: Definitely not a single entity if that's what you mean, sir,
although they know the Edo worship them as a god thing. <br>
PICARD: They know? <br>
DATA: They recognise that this is quite expected and harmless at the
present Edo stage of evolution. <br>
PICARD: What sort of vessel? <br>
DATA: It is perhaps not what we would understand as a vessel, sir. The
dimensions this one occupies allows them to be, well, to be in several
places at once. But they consider this entire star cluster to be
theirs. It was probably
unwise of us to attempt to place a human colony in this area. Of
course, there are three thousand four other planets in
this star cluster in which we could have colonised. The largest and
closest <br>
PICARD: Data, don't babble. <br>
DATA: Babble, sir? I'm not aware that I ever babble, sir. It may be
that from time to time I have considerable information to communicate,
and you may question the way I organise it. <br>
PICARD: Please, organise it into brief answers to my questions. We have
very little time. Do they accept our presence at this planet? <br>
DATA: Undecided, sir. <br>
PICARD: Data, please, feel free to volunteer any important information.
<br>
DATA: I volunteer that they are now observing us, sir. <br>
PICARD: To judge what kind of life forms we are? <br>
DATA: No, it is more curiosity, sir. I doubt that they expect us to
abide by their value systems. <br>
PICARD: Do they know of our Prime Directive? <br>
DATA: They know everything I know, sir. <br>
PICARD: And, if we were to violate the Prime Directive, how <br>
CRUSHER: That's not a fair question. <br>
PICARD: How would they react? <br>
DATA: It would be a case of judging us by our own rules, sir. If we
violate our own Prime Directive, they might consider us to be deceitful
and untrustworthy. You do recall they cautioned us not to interfere
with their children below. What has happened? <br>
CRUSHER: The Edo want to execute my son. I will not allow that to
happen, Jean-Luc. <br>
DATA: Most interesting, sir. The emotion of motherhood, compared to all
others felt by <br>
CRUSHER: Shut up! <br>
(Beverly storms out) <br>
DATA: You were right, sir. I do tend to babble.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 41255.9. Whatever the
object or vessel in orbit with us, it hangs there like a nemesis. It is
one thing to communicate with something mysterious, but it is quite
another to be silently observed by it. I am concerned whether it
understands the same concept of reason that we do?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DATA: You sent for me, sir? <br>
PICARD: Let's have more talk, Data. <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: Sit down. <br>
DATA: What level of communication, sir? <br>
PICARD: Any. My apologies for saying that you babbled. <br>
DATA: But I do, sir. <br>
PICARD: You also see things in a way we do not, but as they truly are.
I need help, my friend. I cannot permit that boy or any member of this
vessel be sacrificed. The Prime Directive never intended that. <br>
DATA: The problem, sir, is there. (the Edo vessel) Although they've
learned of the Prime Directive from my mind, how will they evaluate it?
How do they reason? What are their values? Remember their warning to
us, sir. <br>
PICARD: Exactly. How do I explain my refusing to obey their laws down
there. Not permitting the Crusher boy to be executed. And by so doing
do I endanger this vessel and more than a thousand other lives? <br>
DATA: Would you choose one life over one thousand, sir? <br>
PICARD: I refuse to let arithmetic decide questions like that. Did you
learn anything about the relationship between that and the Edo? Why are
they so certain it's a god? <br>
DATA: Any sufficiently advanced life form would appear to others to be
that, sir. But when they were probing my thoughts, Captain, I could
feel that whatever they are now, they once existed in this dimension,
just as we do. Perhaps in the same kind of flesh and blood form. Since
then, however, they have evolved considerably. Their present existence
in multi-dimensions no doubt has advantages we do not understand. <br>
PICARD: Then in some earlier flesh and blood form they might have
shared our kind of values. <br>
DATA: We know the Edo share them, sir. <br>
PICARD: Why would such an advanced thing feel obliged to protect the
Edo? <br>
DATA: Perhaps the Edo are a child race by comparison. Possibly a race
which those life forms have planted here. Much as we plant human
colonies on Class-M planets. <br>
(Crusher enters) <br>
CRUSHER: Having fulfilled my professional obligations regarding
Commander Data <br>
PICARD: You now request permission to beam down to the planet.
Permission granted. You can accompany me while I try and resolve this.
And you should know that whatever the cost, I will not allow them to
execute your son. <br>
CRUSHER: Thank you, sir. <br>
PICARD: Data, take command. <br>
DATA: Aye, sir.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: It's almost time. I want the boy brought
here now. <br>
(Liator get up) <br>
TASHA: I'll go along with you. <br>
LIATOR: Of course. <br>
(Picard and Crusher beam in. Rivan goes over and kneels, handing back
his communicator) <br>
RIVAN: Captain Picard. I saw you share the sky with God. You must be
Gods. <br>
PICARD: No, no, we're not gods. <br>
(Wesley enters, escorted by the two mediators, Liator and Tasha) <br>
WESLEY: Mother. I guess you know a lot has happened here. <br>
CRUSHER: I know. <br>
WESLEY: Captain Picard, are you going to let them kill me? <br>
PICARD: No. But I must find some way to prevent it that you understand.
<br>
MEDIATOR: How can we let this happen, Liator? They threaten everything
we respect. Our law, our peace, our tranquillity and order. <br>
MEDIATOR 2: You are powerful, but do not do this to us, we beg you. At
least study what we were without law. Hurtful to each other, savage,
thieving. <br>
PICARD: I understand. Perhaps your system of law and punishment is
better than any system we once had. But we do now have a law I must
obey. And part of it says I must protect my people from harm. <br>
LIATOR: We did not ask you to come here. <br>
RIKER: Which has to do with another law that we must obey. <br>
PICARD: We are all sworn not to interfere with other lives in the
galaxy. If I save this boy, I break that law. <br>
MEDIATOR: And you should be executed if you do so! <br>
PICARD: I may suffer almost as much. Starfleet takes the Prime
Directive very seriously. <br>
MEDIATOR 2: No, it is God who will punish you. <br>
PICARD: That thought has crossed our minds. Your god up there may
insist that we obey our non-interference directive. <br>
WESLEY: Sir, does this mean if you save me the entire crew could die? <br>
PICARD: You're not involved in this decision, boy. <br>
WESLEY: I'm sorry, sir, but it seems like I am. <br>
PICARD: Picard to Transporter room. Lock into this signal. Stand by for
six to beam up. Wesley, Lieutenant. <br>
(The Starfleet people gather together) <br>
LIATOR: Our laws have been violated. What of justice? <br>
TASHA: What of justice to Wesley? Does he deserve to die? <br>
PICARD: I'm truly sorry, Liator, but I must have justice for my people
too. Transporter room, energise. <br>
(Nothing happens) <br>
PICARD: Transporter room, come in. <br>
CHIEF [OC]: We can't energise the beam, sir. Everything checks out but
we're getting no results. <br>
MEDIATOR: God has prevented your escape. <br>
CRUSHER: Then your god is unfair. My son had no warning that his act
was criminal. <br>
MEDIATOR 2: We cannot allow ignorance of the law to become a defence. <br>
PICARD: I don't know how to communicate this, or even if it is
possible, but the question of justice has concerned me greatly of
lately. And I say to any creature who may be listening, there can be no
justice so long as laws are absolute. Even life itself is an exercise
in exceptions. <br>
RIKER: When has justice ever been as simple as a rulebook? <br>
(The party are beamed up) <br>
PICARD: It seems the Edo Lord agrees with you, Number One.

PICARD: To the object in orbit with us. We will remove the human
colonists from the adjoining solar system if you signal us to do so.
Please tell us. <br>
DATA: Captain. <br>
(The Edo ship vanishes) <br>
LAFORGE: Is that a signal? <br>
PICARD: I suppose, I suppose it must be. I was hoping for more. <br>
LAFORGE: More of what, sir? I'm glad it's gone. <br>
RIKER: Agreed, sir. Short and sweet. God-like efficiency. <br>
PICARD: I was hoping we'd learn more about it. But since we can't, take
us out of here, Number One. <br>
