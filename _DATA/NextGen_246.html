Captain's log, Stardate 46731.5. We are in the midst of the Volterra
nebula, a stellar nursery. Our three week mission is a routine analysis
of several dozen protostars in various stages of development.

evaluation of the outer shell. Our survey of this protostar is
complete. <br>
PICARD: Ensign, lay in a course to the next one, three quarters
impulse. <br>
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Captain Picard. <br>
PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. <br>
RIKER [OC]: May I see you in the Observation Lounge, sir? <br>
PICARD: I'll be right there.

is a stylistic pottery item,
semi-Buddha shaped) <br>
PICARD: Oh, my God. <br>
GALEN: Then you can identify this object, Mister Picard. <br>
PICARD: Professor Galen? <br>
RIKER: Computer, lights up. <br>
GALEN: I suppose I should say Captain Picard. <br>
RIKER: Professor Galen contacted me from his shuttle an hour ago. He
suggested that we surprise you. <br>
GALEN: To clarify. I insisted and your First Officer was good enough to
accommodate me. I trust I'm not being overly presumptuous, now that my
star pupil is master of the stars. <br>
PICARD: No one is could be more welcome on the Enterprise. I never
thought I would see a Kurlan naiskos. Fifth Dynasty? <br>
GALEN: Is that your conclusion, Mister Picard. Forgive me again. I
should say Captain. <br>
PICARD: Oh, please, Mister will do fine. Well, the overall
configuration is certainly Fifth Dynasty. The surface ornamentation. <br>
GALEN: Yes? <br>
PICARD: Green polychrome over the eyes, and the eyes themselves are
closed. This is third Dynasty. From the workshop of the Master of
Tarquin Hill. <br>
GALEN: Well done. <br>
PICARD: Will, the Master of Tarquin Hill designed ceramic objects that
were three hundred years ahead of their time. All we know of him is the
work. His name has never been discovered. This object is over twelve
thousand years old. <br>
RIKER: The planet Kurl? It's a hell of a long way outside Federation
territory. <br>
PICARD: Indeed. I thought your study of Kurlan artefacts was done long
ago. <br>
GALEN: I happened to be in the neighbourhood last summer. I couldn't
resist. Go ahead. <br>
PICARD: You mean it's complete? <br>
(Picard raises the top half of the pot to reveal a cluster of little
pots inside it) <br>
PICARD: Will, the Kurlan civilisation believed that an individual was a
community of individuals. Inside us are many voices, each with its own
desires, its own style, its own view of the world. The Kurlan
civilisation died out thousands of years ago. It is extraordinarily
rare to find a figurine intact. Professor, this is an incredible find. <br>
GALEN: It's yours, Jean-Luc. <br>
PICARD: Oh, no. No. How can I accept this? <br>
GALEN: Graciously, Mister Picard. You could accept it graciously. <br>
PICARD: Thank you. How long can you stay? There's so much to talk
about. <br>
RIKER: The Professor is scheduled to meet a Vulcan transport the day
after tomorrow. <br>
PICARD: Two days? But that's not enough time. <br>
GALEN: We may have considerably more than that. <br>
PICARD: I don't understand. <br>
GALEN: I am currently on an expedition. A journey into an unexplored
and historical territory, and I intend to take you with me.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: May I ask you a frank question? <br>
GALEN: Please. <br>
PICARD: Your published writings have been sporadic for the last decade.
Your appearance at symposia has been rare, or scheduled and then
cancelled at the last moment. The finest archaeologist of the century
is now shrouded with a cloak of mystery. <br>
GALEN: And as a result my reputation has no doubt grown. <br>
PICARD: I've never heard of anyone that didn't love a good mystery. <br>
GALEN: The Satarran of Sothis Three disdained them, but as a general
idea, your statement holds. <br>
PICARD: So, what have you been doing for the past decade? <br>
GALEN: Are you familiar with micropaleontology? <br>
PICARD: Yes, it's the study of fossil records at the microscopic level.
I read your papers on the subject, but that was years ago. It seemed as
though the work had stopped. <br>
GALEN: No. The work continued. I made a discovery so profound in its
implications that silence seemed the wisest course. This work has
occupied my every waking thought, it's intruded upon my dreams, it's
become my life. When finished and I announce my findings, it will be
heard half way across the galaxy. <br>
PICARD: Tell me. <br>
GALEN: I'm cannot, Mister Picard. That information comes with a price.
Your agreement to join me on the final leg of this expedition. <br>
PICARD: For how long? <br>
GALEN: Three months, perhaps a year. If I had complete diplomatic
access and a starship, it'd be a matter of weeks. But as it is, we'll
have only my shuttle and whatever arrangement we can make with
transports, combined with our talents. <br>
PICARD: Why do you need my help in this? <br>
GALEN: I'm not a young man. There will be hazards along the way. I
don't want my own inadequacies to jeopardise the completion of this
work. <br>
PICARD: I'm deeply honoured that you'd think of me, but I have
responsibilities. <br>
GALEN: To History. What if you could have helped Schliemann discover
the City of Troy, or been with M'Tell as she first stepped on Ya'Seem.
How could anything compare? <br>
PICARD: May I sleep on it? <br>
GALEN: Dream not of today, Mister Picard. <br>
PICARD: Dream not of today. The night blessing of the Yash-El. <br>
GALEN: As I recall, you missed that question on the final exam. <br>
PICARD: Well, I've had a few years to look it up. Professor, the
Enterprise is yours for as long as you're here. <br>
GALEN: Thank you. <br>
PICARD: Dream not of today.

CRUSHER: Good morning. Looks like you've been up for a while. <br>
PICARD: Yes. <br>
(Beverly pours herself a cup of tea) <br>
CRUSHER: Let's hear it. <br>
PICARD: I had a long talk with Professor Galen last night. He asked me
to leave the Enterprise, to join him in an archaeological expedition
which could last for nearly a year. <br>
CRUSHER: That must be tempting. <br>
PICARD: I couldn't leave the Enterprise. But the offer raised in me
certain feelings of regret. <br>
CRUSHER: That you could have been an archaeologist and not a starship
Captain? <br>
PICARD: No, not really. I'm not sorry for the path I chose. But the
Professor did not choose this figure at random. The many voices inside
the one. You see, he knows that the past is a very insistent voice
inside of me. This gift is meant to remind me of that. <br>
CRUSHER: And the exploration of space? Surely that must count for
something. <br>
PICARD: I wouldn't trade it for anything, and I would still make the
same choice I made all those years ago. I just wish that I didn't have
to say no to him a second time. <br>
CRUSHER: Were you two very close? <br>
PICARD: I had a father, but he was like a father who understood me. And
he had his own children but they didn't follow in his footsteps, so I
was like the son who understood him. <br>
CRUSHER: And yet you turned your back on him. <br>
PICARD: In a way, I wish he'd never come on board the ship.

GALEN: Good morning, Mister Picard. <br>
PICARD: Professor. <br>
GALEN: The Vulcan ship will take us as far as DS Four. An Al-Leyan
transport is scheduled to arrive at the station three weeks later.
They'll take us as far as Caere, and then we'll use the shuttle to get
us to Indri Eight, our first stop. <br>
PICARD: Professor, I'm afraid I won't be going. The Enterprise isn't
something that I can leave and then come back to. If I go, I go for
good. It's not something I'm not prepared to do. <br>
GALEN: This is not some undergraduate study project that you're turning
down. This is the chance of a lifetime. Don't make the same mistake
twice. <br>
PICARD: You don't believe that my career in Starfleet has been a
mistake. <br>
GALEN: What are you doing at this very moment? A study mission. You're
like some Roman centurion out patrolling the provinces, maintenancing a
dull and bloated Empire. <br>
PICARD: We both know that's not true. <br>
GALEN: I know this. I know that as a scholar, you're nothing but a
dilettante. Years ago, I gave you the opportunity to become the finest
archaeologist of your generation. Your achievements could have
outstripped even my own, but no, you decided to reject a life of
profound discovery. You walked out on me. <br>
PICARD: I never wanted to become <br>

PICARD: I can't. <br>

for another two days. <br>

the Professor's shuttle. <br>
PICARD: What did they want? <br>
LAFORGE: I'm not sure, but it looks like they were trying to download
something from his computer. <br>
DATA: When he was attacked, Professor Galen began to protect certain
files in his computer memory. <br>
LAFORGE: We were able to partially reconstruct the shuttle's computers,
so at least we have some of those files. We found nineteen different
blocks of numbers like this one. <br>
(five digit groups in white, orange and pink) <br>
PICARD: What do they mean? <br>
DATA: They could mean anything. Unless we can narrow the parameters of
the search, it would be almost impossible for the computer to identify
the pattern with any accuracy. <br>
LAFORGE: We tried every decryption key on record in case Professor
Galen was using some kind of code. We still can't make heads or tails
of them. <br>
WORF: Were the Yridians able to get these number blocks? <br>
LAFORGE: At least some of them. It's impossible to say know many. <br>
PICARD: Apparently, the Yridians knew more about the Professor's work
than we do. They may have known what these numbers mean. <br>
LAFORGE: If they did, that information died with them. <br>
PICARD: Not necessarily. The Yridians are information dealers. They may
have been delivering the number blocks to someone else. Did they send a
signal before they were destroyed? <br>
WORF: No, sir. We detected no transmissions. <br>
LAFORGE: And there were no other vessels in the vicinity. <br>
PICARD: Did the shuttle's flight logs show where Galen had been before
coming to the Enterprise? <br>
DATA: Yes, sir. The logs indicate Professor Galen visited an unexplored
star system, Ruah Four. <br>
PICARD: What's the distance from our present position? <br>
DATA: Four days at warp six, sir. <br>
PICARD: The conference can wait. Set a course for the Ruah system.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Standard orbit, Ensign. <br>
DATA: Ruah Four is a class-M planet. Sixty seven percent of its surface
is covered with water. Its landmass contains multiple animal species,
including a genus of proto-hominids. <br>
PICARD: Scan for earthworks or monuments that might indicate a previous
civilisation. <br>
DATA: There is nothing to indicate former occupancy by even a primitive
culture, sir. <br>
PICARD: Then what was the foremost archaeologist in the Federation
doing here? He left the Enterprise in a Vulcan ship for Deep Space
Four, and then an Al-Leyan transport to Caere, and then the shuttle to
Indri Eight. Mister Data, what do we know about Indri Eight? <br>
DATA: The Indri system was first identified by Federation vessels
nearly sixty years ago. The eighth planet is L-class. It is covered by
deciduous vegetation, unexplored, with no apparent evidence of
civilisations, either present or past. The planet possesses no animal
life whatsoever. <br>
PICARD: Number One, we'll proceed to Indri Eight. <br>
RIKER: With all due respect, sir, we've already run into one dead end.
Indri Eight doesn't seem much more promising. And we're late for the
conference on Atalia Seven. <br>
PICARD: I'm aware of the Federation's timetable, Number One. Professor
Galen visited here a few days ago. And he was on his way to Indri Eight
when he was killed. There's some connection between these two planets.
I'm going to find it. <br>

bring him back. The conference on Atalia Seven has been scheduled for
six months. Starfleet is relying on your mediation efforts to <br>

Enterprise and its crew on some wild goose chase to purge myself of
guilt and remorse. I will not let Galen's death to be in vain. Now, if
that means inconveniencing a few squabbling delegates for a few days,
then so be it. I will take the full responsibility. <br>

PICARD: The planets that these fragments are from are scattered across
the quadrant. No wonder it took the Professor so long to collect them.
But why? <br>
CRUSHER: Wait a minute. These fragments all seem to have similar
protein configurations. They may be chemically compatible. <br>
PICARD: But how can that be possible? They're different species from
different planets. There should be no compatibility at all. <br>
CRUSHER: I know, but look at the base pair combinations, they're
uniform. If I'm right. Computer, connect the DNA fragments according to
protein link compatibility. <br>

This is part of an algorithm, coded at the molecular level. <br>
PICARD: An algorithm? Are you saying that these DNA fragments are
elements in some kind of computer
programme? <br>
LAFORGE: I know how it sounds, but there's no way this could be a
random formation. This is definitely part of a
programme. <br>
CRUSHER: This fragment has been part of every DNA strand on Earth since
life began there, and the other fragments are just as old. Someone must
have written this programme over four billion years ago. <br>
PICARD: So, four billion years ago someone scattered this genetic
material into the primordial soup of at least nineteen different
planets across the galaxy? <br>
DATA: The genetic information must have been incorporated into the
earliest lifeforms on these planets, and then passed down through each
generation. <br>
CRUSHER: But why would anyone do this in the first place? <br>
PICARD: And what was this programme designed to do? <br>
LAFORGE: Well, we couldn't know that until we assembled the entire
programme and then ran it. We've tried all the DNA material in the
Federation computer, but we haven't been able to come up with any with
compatible protein configurations. <br>
PICARD: Then they must be from worlds outside the Federation. Mister
Data, how many people on the Enterprise are from non-Federation
planets? <br>
DATA: Seventeen, sir. <br>
PICARD: You know, this may be a long shot, but we should check each one
of these seventeen people to see if they have the correct protein
configurations. <br>
CRUSHER: I'll begin collecting DNA samples now. <br>
LAFORGE: You know, Captain, I've been thinking. Somebody else must know
about this
programme. I bet one of the missing fragments was on Indri Eight.
That's why it was destroyed. <br>
PICARD: To keep us from finding that piece of the puzzle. It's four
billion years old. A computer
programme from a highly advanced civilisation, and it's hidden in the
very fabric of life itself. Whatever information this programme
contains could be the most profound discovery of our time. Or the most
dangerous. And the Professor knew that.

nowhere. I think we all know about Professor Galen's research, and
about the computer programme composed of DNA fragments. I'll take your
silence as confirmation. Now, it stands to reason that none of us has
the DNA fragments necessary to complete the programme. You were the
first to arrive in this system. Do you have an organic sample from the
planet below? <br>
OCETT: Yes. And I will fire on anyone who attempts to obtain another
one. <br>
NU'DAQ: As if we fear Cardassian threats. <br>
PICARD: I believe that one of you has a fragment from Indri Eight. <br>
NU'DAQ: Yes. And there will be no other samples from Indri Eight. <br>
OCETT: What is that supposed to mean? <br>
PICARD: He destroyed the biosphere of the planet after he had taken the
sample. <br>
OCETT: Typical Klingon thinking. Take what you want and destroy the
rest. <br>
PICARD: We're all missing some of the fragments, not necessarily the
same ones. Unless we combine the ones we have, we will never learn the
secret of the
programme. <br>
NU'DAQ: There is no secret. It is an ancient weapon design of
incredible power. And the Klingon Empire will not allow it to fall into
an enemy's hands. Or even a friend's. <br>
OCETT: A weapon? The Yridian who sold us the information claimed that
the programme
would yield the key to an unlimited power source. <br>
PICARD: But until we assemble it, we will never know its purpose. <br>
OCETT: He's right. As far as we know, it might just be a recipe for
biscuits. <br>
NU'DAQ: Biscuits? If that is what you believe, then go back to
Cardassia. I will send you my mother's recipe. <br>
OCETT: How dare you! <br>
PICARD: Myriap! Enough. Without cooperation we will get nowhere. <br>
OCETT: What do you propose? <br>
PICARD: If you each bring your samples on board the Enterprise, I will
combine them with ours. And then we will all observe the results
simultaneously, giving no one the advantage. <br>
NU'DAQ: And if we refuse? <br>
PICARD: Then this endeavour dies here, in this room.

(The Klingon enters his data and more sections link up) <br>
NU'DAQ: Excellent. <br>
(Ocett adds her data, and it looks a good three quarters done) <br>
CRUSHER: There's still one missing piece. <br>
NU'DAQ: Pahk! We have surrendered what we had for nothing. <br>
OCETT: You are remarkably short sighted, Nu'Daq. We are closer to the
answer than we were. <br>
PICARD: We may be very much closer indeed. <br>
NU'DAQ: How can that be? We have no idea where to start looking for the
missing DNA fragment. <br>
PICARD: This is a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces are scattered across the
galaxy. Doesn't it make it natural to assume that the original
designers of the puzzle should want us to find it? Why else would they
have put the pieces in our DNA? And in turn, doesn't suggest they would
try to make it easy for us to find those pieces, that there might be
some pattern to their distribution? <br>
CRUSHER: The computer might be able to find that pattern. <br>
PICARD: Doctor, programme the computer to analyse the distribution of
the pieces that we have, correcting for changes in star configurations
over four billion years, then extrapolate for the missing piece. <br>
CRUSHER: That's going to take several hours to set up and to process.
If you'll excuse me. <br>
PICARD: If you wish, you can stay on board while we wait. <br>

as there is any information. <br>
NU'DAQ: Commander, your reputation for physical strength is known even
in the Klingon Empire. You are familiar with the B'aht Qul challenge? <br>

Data mirrors him, putting his hands inside Nu'Daq's) <br>

to his PADD) <br>

DATA: My upper spinal support is a polyalloy designed to withstand
extreme stress. My skull is composed of cortenide and duranium. <br>
NU'DAQ: I understand your intellectual prowess is equally impressive.
If I were to learn of the results from the computer search before the
others, the Klingon Empire would have a strategic advantage. A being of
your abilities would go far in the Empire. <br>
DATA: You are attempting to bribe me. <br>
NU'DAQ: Not at all. <br>

I would be capable of executing. You then implied a reward. Clearly you
were <br>

code. <br>

fossilised. It could still contain organic material. <br>

head, the first but not the last she will wear on Trek) <br>
HUMANOID: You're wondering who we are, why we have done this, how it
has come that I stand before you, the image of a being from so long
ago. Life evolved on my planet before all others in this part of the
galaxy. We left our world, explored the stars, and found none like
ourselves. Our civilisation thrived for ages, but what is the life of
one race, compared to the vast stretches of cosmic time? We knew that
one day we would be gone, that nothing of us would survive. So, we left
you. Our scientists seeded the primordial oceans of many worlds, where
life was in its infancy. The seed codes directed your evolution toward
a physical form resembling ours. This body you see before you, which
is, of course, shaped as yours is shaped, for you are the end result.
The seed codes also contained this message, which we scattered in
fragments on many different worlds. It was our hope that you would have
to come together in fellowship and companionship to hear this message.
And if you can see and hear me, our hope has been fulfilled. You are a
monument, not to our greatness, but to our existence. That was our
wish, that you too would know life, and would keep alive our memory.
There is something of us in each of you, and so, something of you in
each other. Remember us. <br>

NU'DAQ: That's all? If she were not dead, I would kill her. <br>

with a Klingon, it turns my stomach. <br>
