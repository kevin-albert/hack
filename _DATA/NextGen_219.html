Captain's log, stardate 45703.9. We are en route to Earth, where it
will be my pleasant duty to deliver this year's commencement address at
Starfleet Academy. I'm also looking forward to seeing Wesley Crusher
again. His flight team will perform a demonstration near Saturn that
will be transmitted to the graduation ceremonies.

update on our estimated arrival. <br>
PICARD: Mister Data? <br>
DATA: We should be arriving at Earth in ten hours sixteen minutes, sir.
<br>
PICARD: Please inform the Academy, Mister Worf, and send my regards to
Superintendant Brand. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
TROI: Do you know Admiral Brand? <br>
PICARD: We've met a few times. She's a formidable woman. <br>
RIKER: Sounds like my superintendent. When I was at the Academy, we had
a Vulcan Superintendent who had memorised the personnel files of every
single cadet. He knew everything about them. It was like having your
parents around all the time. <br>
PICARD: My superintendent was a Betazoid, a full telepath. When he sent
for you to his office, he didn't have to ask what you'd done. <br>
RIKER: You got called into the superintendent's office? That's a story
I'd like to hear. <br>
WORF: Sir, we are being hailed again by the Academy. It is Admiral
Brand. <br>
PICARD: On screen. <br>
WORF: Sir, she is requesting a private channel. <br>

CRUSHER: Have they completed the regeneration series? <br>
PICARD: I'm not certain. <br>
CRUSHER: Wesley's allergic to metorapan treatments. I think they'll
have to use a bicaridine substitute. I should send his complete records
to the Academy infirmary. Of course, they probably have them already,
but you can't be too sure. <br>
PICARD: Beverly. He's fine. <br>
CRUSHER: I know he's fine. I know he's fine. How did it happen? <br>
PICARD: Apparently, his squadron was practicing on the Academy flight
range near Saturn. they were flying a close formation. There was a
collision. All five ships were destroyed. Four of the cadets managed to
transport out. One didn't make it. <br>
CRUSHER: Do you know who it was? <br>
PICARD: Yes. His name was Joshua Albert. <br>
CRUSHER: Wesley spoke of him. They were friends. Wesley was so excited
to make the flight team. Of course, I was a little nervous, but I was
proud of him. I always knew there was a chance that something like this
might <br>

BRAND: There was very little left to salvage from the wreckage. We did
recover one of the ships' data recorders, but it was badly damaged.
We're attempting to restore the information, but that will take some
time. Standard procedure calls for an immediate investigation by two
command level officers. Captain Satelk and I will be taking depositions
from Nova Squadron at fifteen hundred hours today. Commander Albert.
I'm sure that everyone in this room joins me in expressing my deepest
sympathies to you on the tragic loss of your son. There will be a
memorial service for Cadet Albert this evening in the west garden. It
has been suggested that we should cancel the graduation ceremonies in
the light of what's happened. Commander Albert and I have discussed
this and we've agreed that commencement should go forward as planned.
The cadets should know that even after a tragedy like this, there are
still duties to perform and life continues. Thank you all for coming. <br>
(Picard gets up and walks over to Brand) <br>
BRAND: It's good to see you again, Captain. I wish it were under better
circumstances. <br>
PICARD: This is an unhappy way to begin commencement. If you require
any assistance, then the Enterprise is at your disposal. <br>

you for your offer. </font></p>

WESLEY: No. I don't think so. No, thank you. I know you're trying to be

Except that time you caught that Ligonian with a reverse body lift and
pinned him in the first fourteen seconds of the match. Didn't think you
had it in you. <br>
PICARD: Well, it was all in the legs, all that running I did. Boothby. <br>

appreciate. <br>

(They go walking) <br>
PICARD: Yes, there is. I just wanted to, while I was here. Look, you
know as well as I do I would never have graduated if you <br>
BOOTHBY: You made a mistake. There isn't a man among us who hasn't been
young enough to make one. <br>
PICARD: Nevertheless. <br>
BOOTHBY: You did what you had to do. You did what you thought was best.
I just made sure that you listened to yourself. <br>
PICARD: At the time I thought you were a mean-spirited, vicious old
man. <br>
BOOTHBY: I was. And by the way, I was about the same age you are now. <br>
PICARD: I didn't speak to you for months. <br>
BOOTHBY: You needed to get your bearings. I knew that. The important
thing is, what you did with your life afterwards. Seems you did okay.
That's thanks enough for me. <br>

LOCARNO: At this point, we accelerated and executed a starboard turn of
twenty seven degrees. We came out of the turn on course for Titan. <br>
BRAND: And you were still in the lead position? <br>
LOCARNO: Yes, sir. <br>
BRAND: Continue. <br>
LOCARNO: As we entered Titan's gravitational sphere, I gave the signal
to tighten up and move into a diamond slot formation. Remaining in the
diamond formation, we executed a low apogee turn around Titan then
began a z-plus twenty five degree climb in preparation for a Yeager
loop. <br>
(named for Chuck Yeager, who broke the sound barrier in 1947) <br>
LOCARNO: Approximately nine seconds later, Cadet Albert's ship collided
with Cadet Hajar's. We had less than two seconds to
activate our emergency transporters and beam to the evac stations at
Mimas. Everyone made it except Josh. <br>
BRAND: Thank you, Mister Locarno. Cadet Hajar. <br>
(the young woman stands up) <br>
BRAND: As team navigator, you filed a flight plan with the Academy
Range Officer before the exercise. Correct? <br>
HAJAR: Yes, sir. <br>
BRAND: Did Nova Squadron deviate from that flight plan after you
entered the Saturn range? <br>
HAJAR: No, sir. <br>
BRAND: Then how do you explain the fact that the low apogee turn around
Titan was at least two thousand kilometres closer to the moon than
indicated in your plan? <br>
HAJAR: We were still within flight safety parameters, sir. <br>
BRAND: That was not my question, Cadet. <br>
HAJAR: We had discussed changing our approach after I filed the flight
plan. The final decision was made en route to Saturn. I didn't consider
it significant enough to mention here. I apologise for the confusion,
sir. I should have been more precise. <br>
SATELK: (a Vulcan) Did you see Mister Albert's ship break formation
before it collided with your ship? <br>
HAJAR: No, sir. My first indications of trouble was when my proximity
alarm went off. <br>
SATELK: You may be seated. Did any of you see the collision take place?
<br>
LOCARNO: No, sir. <br>
SATELK: Cadet Sito, you were in the tail position, therefore you should
have seen any sign of trouble from Cadet Albert. Yet you saw nothing? <br>
SITO: That is correct, sir. <br>
SATELK: Did your attention falter? <br>
SITO: No, sir. I was flying solely on sensor readings at the time. I
did not have any visual contact with Cadet Albert's ship when he broke
formation. <br>
SATELK: Sensor readings? <br>
(a murmur goes around the room) <br>
CRUSHER: What's wrong? <br>
PICARD: Well, it's unusual to fly on sensors alone in this type of
manoeuvre. The pilot relies on visual clues from the other ships to
maintain formation. <br>
BRAND: If you were flying on sensors alone, perhaps you could tell us
the orientation of his ship before the collision. <br>
SITO: I don't know, sir. <br>
BRAND: You were flying a ship, travelling eighty thousand kph, with
Cadet Albert's ship less than ten metres away and you don't know what
his orientation was? <br>
SITO: I don't remember, sir. <br>
LOCARNO: Sir, may I? <br>
BRAND: Go ahead. <br>
LOCARNO: Admiral, Josh was a good pilot but lately he'd been having
difficulties. He'd get nervous during close fly-bys and pull away in
the final seconds. His formation flying was a little erratic. <br>
BRAND: And you didn't report this to anyone? <br>
LOCARNO: No, sir, I didn't. We'd flown together a long time. I thought
he could handle it if I gave him a chance. I was wrong. <br>
BRAND: Then you are saying that the accident was Cadet Albert's fault? <br>
LOCARNO: I think Josh got frightened and tried to pull out of the turn
prematurely, and then crashed into Cadet Hajar. Josh was our friend. We
didn't want him to be remembered as someone who panicked. <br>
BRAND: Please be seated. I'm very disturbed by what I've heard here
today. By your own admission, you allowed your teammate to fly when you
knew he was having difficulties maintaining formation. That
demonstrates a serious lack of judgment. I am also disturbed by the
fact that you did not come forward with this information immediately.
We should have the first data from Mister Crusher's flight recorder
tonight. We will reconvene at thirteen hundred hours tomorrow. <br>

lie to them. <br>

LOCARNO: Look, he was my friend too, Wes. I worked to get him on this

LOCARNO: Of course we do. None of us has wanted to say it out loud, but
we've all had the same thought. Haven't we? <br>

have to look out for ourselves now. What do you want us to do, walk in
and tell them everything that happened? <br>
SITO: We might as well turn in our uniforms and start packing our bags.
<br>
LOCARNO: Are we ready for that? We'll take this one step at a time.
This is the preliminary report from your flight recorder.
It was so badly damaged in the crash, that the lab could only retrieve
a third of the total telemetry on the recorder. And all of it is before
the collision. There's no problem here. <br>
WESLEY: I don't know if I can do this, Nick. <br>
SITO: You don't have to lie. Just don't volunteer any new information. <br>
LOCARNO: The first night I met you, Wes, I knew I wanted you on this
squad. You, more than any of the rest, would understand what it means
to be able to count on someone, because you've been out there, putting
yourself on the line. You know you've got to be able to count on the
people on your team, because your life is in their hands, and their
lives are in yours. We made a promise to each other right in the
beginning, that we'd stick together. We were Nova Squadron. Nobody else
could say that. And even after we graduated, we'd try to get posted to
the same duty. We were going to be a team for a long time. Josh can't
be a part of those plans anymore, but I think he would still want us to
be a team. What do you think?

tried to veer away, but it was too late and I was hit. I lost control
of my ship. A power coupling exploded in my cockpit. I don't know how,
but I managed to activate my escape transporter, and the next thing I

WESLEY: No, sir. <br>

backwards at a steep angle, and at the peak of the loop, turn over and
accelerate in a new direction. <br>
SATELK: Mister Crusher, did your team remain in formation throughout
the loop? <br>
WESLEY: Yes, sir. <br>
BRAND: I want you to be absolutely clear on this point, Mister Crusher.
Before the collision, was Nova Squadron in a diamond slot formation? <br>
WESLEY: Yes, sir. <br>

These images were obtained by a navigational control satellite in orbit
around Saturn during a standard sensor sweep. Computer, freeze image.
Magnify sector gamma three and enhance. <br>

Speed, attitude, course. <br>
PICARD: Did Wesley's flight recorder indicate that there was anything
unusual about the ship or the way it was operating? <br>
LAFORGE: The starboard power flow was fluctuating. <br>
DATA: However it was well within operational limits. <br>
LAFORGE: Fluidic pressure in the landing struts was low, but I don't
know what difference that would make. <br>
DATA: We did find that Wesley opened his coolant interlock just before
beginning the manoeuvre around Titan. <br>
LAFORGE: That is a bit unusual. Normally the interlock is closed unless
you're performing a check on the engine coolant levels. But there's no
evidence Wesley was performing that sort of check. <br>
PICARD: Filling the primary coolant tanks requires an open interlock
but that can only be performed in a maintenance bay. Is there any other
reason for opening the valve? <br>
LAFORGE: It's the first step in purging the plasma exhaust. <br>
DATA: That procedure would be extremely hazardous while the ship was in
flight. <br>
LAFORGE: Yeah, the engine would probably ignite the plasma. <br>
PICARD: Ignite the plasma. That's exactly what they were trying to do.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Come. <br>
WESLEY: Captain. <br>
PICARD: Can you tell me what manoeuvre this is? <br>
(on the PADD we see five ships go into a circle, cross each other's
paths and light up a five pointed star) <br>
WESLEY: It's a Kolvoord Starburst, sir. <br>
PICARD: Five ships crossing within ten metres of each other and
igniting their plasma trails. One of the most spectacular and difficult
demonstrations of precision flying. It hasn't been performed at the
Academy team in over a hundred years. Do you know why? <br>
WESLEY: It was banned by the Academy following a training accident,
sir. <br>
PICARD: An accident in which all five cadets lost their lives. I think
that Nicholas Locarno wanted to end his Academy career in a blaze of
glory. That he convinced the four of you to learn the Kolvoord
Starburst for the commencement demonstration. If it worked,
you would thrill the assembled guests and Locarno would graduate as a
living legend. Only it didn't work, and Joshua Albert paid the price.
Am I correct? Cadet, I asked you a question. Am I correct? <br>
WESLEY: I choose not to answer, sir. <br>
PICARD: You choose not to answer? But you've already given an answer to
the inquiry, and that answer was a lie. <br>
WESLEY: I said the accident occurred after the loop. It did. <br>
PICARD: What you neglected to mention was that following the loop your
team attempted a manoeuvre that was the direct cause of the crash. You
told the truth up to a point. But a lie of omission is still a lie. Do
you remember the day you first came aboard this ship? Your mother
brought you on the Bridge. <br>
WESLEY: Yes. <br>
PICARD: You even sat in my chair. I was annoyed. Presumptuous child
playing on my ship. But I never forgot how you already knew every
control, every display. You behaved as though you belonged on the
Bridge. And then later when I decided to make you an acting ensign, I
was convinced you could be an outstanding officer. I've never
questioned that conviction, until now. The first duty of every
Starfleet officer is to the truth. Whether it's scientific truth, or
historical truth, or personal truth. It is the guiding principle upon
which Starfleet is based. If you can't find it within yourself to stand
up and tell the truth about what happened you don't deserve to wear
that uniform. I'm going to make this simple for you, Mister Crusher.
Either you come forward and tell Admiral Brand what really took place,
or I will. <br>
WESLEY: Captain <br>
PICARD: Dismissed.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LOCARNO: Your message said it was urgent. <br>
WESLEY: They know, Nick. They know what we did. <br>
LOCARNO: Calm down. Calm down. Now tell me exactly what happened. <br>
WESLEY: Captain Picard called me to the Enterprise. when I got there he
told me that he knows.
The Kolvoord manoeuvre, the cover up, everything. He said that if I
didn't come forward and tell the truth now, he would. <br>
LOCARNO: You said he'd figured it out. Does he have any evidence? <br>
WESLEY: No, but he knew exactly how it happened. <br>
LOCARNO: Captain Picard doesn't know anything. He has a theory. So let
him tell the inquiry what he thinks happened. They'll ask us, is it
true? We'll say, no, sir. There's no evidence, so there's no case.
We'll get off with a reprimand. <br>
WESLEY: I can't call Captain Picard a liar. <br>
LOCARNO: Wesley, we have to hang on just a little longer, then this
will all be over. <br>
WESLEY: It's wrong, Nick. <br>
LOCARNO: Wesley. <br>
WESLEY: No. I'm going to tell them what happened. <br>
LOCARNO: You're going to tell them what happened? You? Alone? Are going
to decide what happens to me, to Sito, to Jean? You're going to decide
that? <br>
WESLEY: I'm not going to lie to them again, Nick. I can't live with it.
<br>
LOCARNO: You can't lie to them. You can't live with this. You have to
tell them what happened. Who the hell are you? <br>
WESLEY: Nick! <br>
LOCARNO: You're going to turn us in? <br>
WESLEY: Now wait a minute. <br>
LOCARNO: No, you wait a minute. He got to you, didn't he? Picard told
you some big story about duty and honour. It must've been a pretty good
speech to make you turn your back on your friends. <br>
WESLEY: We're Starfleet cadets. We have a duty to the truth. <br>
LOCARNO: What about your duty to your friends? I got you on this team.
I gave you a chance when there were upperclassmen waiting in line. I
said, He won't let us down. He was on the Enterprise. He knows what
it's like to trust somebody with his life. I guess I was wrong. <br>
WESLEY: If we all come forward together and tell Admiral Brand <br>
LOCARNO: We don't want to come forward. Sito, Jean and me, we don't
have a problem with this. But if you do, then resign your appointment
to the Academy and walk away. Don't make us pay for your guilty
conscience. <br>
WESLEY: You'd let me do that? You'd let me throw my career away just to
save your neck? <br>
LOCARNO: To save the team. That's more important than you, and it's
more important than me. And if I was in your place I'd do it without
hesitation. But that's me.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BRAND: Captain Satelk and I have gone over your
testimony and the physical evidence from the crash. Your statements
cannot be reconciled with the data collected from the NavCon satellite.
Your unwillingness to offer any explanation for this contradiction is
disappointing, and raises suspicion. We cannot escape the conclusion
that either the data is faulty in some way, or you have lied to us.
However suspicion is not proof and I have no proof that you have lied
to this inquiry. Therefore, if no further evidence is presented, I have
no choice but to close this investigation. For filing an inaccurate
flight plan, and for allowing Cadet Albert to fly when you knew he was
having difficulties, I am ordering a formal reprimand placed on each of
your permanent records. I am also revoking your flight privileges. This
inquiry is closed. <br>
WESLEY: Sir. I would like to add something to my testimony. <br>
BRAND: Proceed, Mister Crusher. <br>
WESLEY: Yesterday I testified that the crash occurred following a
Yeager loop. That is not entirely true. We performed a loop, and
afterwards broke formation and attempted a Kolvoord Starburst. We knew
it was prohibited. We knew it was dangerous, but we wanted to do
something spectacular for the commencement demonstration. We pushed
Josh into it and he wasn't ready. We thought we could do it. We thought
we could do anything. We were wrong, and Josh died. Josh didn't let us
down, sir. It wasn't his fault. <br>
BRAND: Mister Locarno, you are the leader of Nova Squadron. Do you have
anything to say? Mister Locarno? <br>
LOCARNO: No, sir.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Academy gardens]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Mister Locarno has been expelled. <br>
WESLEY: They should've expelled all of us. <br>
PICARD: They very nearly did. Mister Locarno made an impassioned plea
for the rest of you. He said that he'd used his influence as squadron
leader to convince you to attempt the Kolvoord manoeuvre and then to
cover up the truth. He asked to take full responsibility. <br>
WESLEY: He did exactly what he said he would. He protected the team. I
feel awful. I've let down everyone. My mother, my friends, you. <br>
PICARD: You should feel bad, and you will pay for what you've done.
Admiral Brand has decided that in addition to a formal reprimand, your
academic credits for the past year will be cancelled and you will not
advance with your class. <br>
WESLEY: I understand. <br>
PICARD: It's not going to be easy, staying here on campus, everyone
knowing what you did. You have difficult times ahead. <br>
WESLEY: Yes, sir. Thank you, Captain. <br>
PICARD: You knew what you had to do. I just made sure you listened to
yourself. Goodbye, Cadet. <br>
WESLEY: Goodbye, Captain. </font> </p>
