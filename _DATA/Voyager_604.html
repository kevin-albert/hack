Gedrin! Gedrin! What happened? I lost you. <br>(She finally runs into a male.)<br>
GEDRIN: Thirty seven bio-pods were damaged. I had to disconnect them
from the reactor. <br>
JISA: Were they dead? <br>
GEDRIN: I had no choice. The main power's holding. The rest of the

Report. <br>
KIM: We've entered some kind of a subspace corridor. <br>
PARIS: We were cruising at warp six then, wham, this thing pulled at
our warp field like a magnet. <br>
JANEWAY: Where did that debris come from? <br>
TUVOK: Unknown, but the corridor is filled with it. Metal fragments,
plasma exhaust, organic residue. <br>
SEVEN: Some of the debris is over eight hundred years old, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd like to avoid becoming part of this garbage stream. Can
you find a way out? <br>
PARIS: I don't now. There's hundreds of corridors. It's like a maze. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, be a good rat and find us the cheese, hmm? <br>
PARIS: I'll do my best, Captain. <br>(An object with two glowing points of light is also travelling in the corridor. They overtake it very rapidly.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok? <br>
TUVOK: It was a vessel, sir. They are hailing us. <br>
JANEWAY: Put it through. <br>(It is a pale alien with lots of elaborate bony bits around its face.)<br>
TUREI [on viewscreen]: Who are you? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Starship Voyager. And you
are? <br>
TUREI [on viewscreen]: This underspace belongs to us. <br>
JANEWAY: We're here by accident. We're trying to find a way out. Can
you help us? <br>
TUREI [on viewscreen]: Help you? Yes, we'll help you. <br>
TUVOK: They are targeting our shields with a resonance pulse. It's
altering the harmonics. We're being pushed out of the corridor. <br>
PARIS: We're clear. <br>
TUVOK: The vessel has exited the corridor as well. <br>
PARIS: Captain, we're over two hundred light years from where we
entered the corridor. <br>
KIM: Two hundred light years in five minutes? <br>
JANEWAY: Hail them. Thank you for your help. There's something I'd like
to ask you. We've got a long journey ahead of us and I was wondering if
we could negotiate passage through this underspace of yours. <br>
TUREI [on viewscreen]: Lower your shields. Prepare to be boarded. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Boarded? For what reason? <br>
TUREI [on viewscreen]: We must purge your computer. Remove all readings
you've gathered in our territory. <br>
JANEWAY: We pose no threat to you. We're simply trying <br>
TUREI [on viewscreen]: We're going to destroy that information, one way
or another. Lower your shields. <br>
JANEWAY: I won't do that. <br>(Transmission ends, and Turei starts firing at Voyager.)<br>JANEWAY:&nbsp;Evasive manoeuvres. Try to disable them. <br>
TUVOK: Their vessel is highly manoeuvrable. It's difficult to get a
phaser lock. <br>
KIM: Picking up two more ships heading our way . <br>
PARIS: Direct hit. Our warp drive is offline. <br>
TUVOK: Shields down to eighty two percent. Sixty percent. <br>
PARIS: They're closing. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We could use some clever suggestions about now. <br>
SEVEN: There's a planet eight million kilometres ahead, uninhabited. But
the atmosphere is charged with radiogenic particles. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How radiogenic? <br>
SEVEN: Three thousand isorems. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If we route enough power to the shields we can survive in
that, but maybe our friends can't. <br>
TUVOK: Shields at fifty three percent. <br>
JANEWAY: Do it.<br>PARIS:
Entering the thermosphere. <br>
KIM: Radiation levels at three thousand isorems and climbing. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The alien ships? <br>
TUVOK: In pursuit and charging weapons. <br>
JANEWAY: Increase our descent vector. <br>
PARIS: They're still closing. <br>
TUVOK: Direct hit to our aft shields. <br>
JANEWAY: Find the highest concentration of radiation, and take us
through it. <br>
KIM: Proximity radiation at four thousand isorems. Five thousand. Six. <br>
TUVOK: Their shields are weakening. They're breaking off. <br>
JANEWAY: Now, all we need is a place to set down and make repairs. Tom?
<br>
PARIS: We're clearing the lower stratosphere. <br>
JANEWAY: On screen. <br>(They see the ruined city.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: I thought you said this planet was uninhabited. <br>
KIM: Radiation must have interfered with my scans. <br>
PARIS: I doubt it's inhabited anymore. Looks like this planet's in the
middle of a nuclear winter. <br>
TUVOK: Agreed. Gamma radiation levels are highly toxic. The impact
crater suggests an orbital bombardment. <br>
JANEWAY: How long ago? <br>
KIM: From the rate of radiogenic decay, eight hundred&nbsp;ninety two
years. <br>
JANEWAY: This must have been a city of millions. Set us down. <br>(Paris obeys. Voyager lands in the middle of the ruins.)<br>PARIS:
Disengaging engines. <br>
JANEWAY: Stand down red alert. Assign damage repair teams, And Tom, make
sure B'Elanna has enough help in Engineering. I want those warp engines
back online. <br>
PARIS: Yes, ma'am. <br>
TUVOK: Our friends are still in orbit. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Circling like vultures. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, they're going to go hungry. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Not if they find a way to adapt their shields and come down
after us. <br>
KIM: Captain, I'm detecting faint life signs coming from a chamber
several hundred metres beneath the surface. <br>
JANEWAY: Survivors? <br>
CHAKOTAY: After nine hundred years? <br>
JANEWAY: Oversee the repair teams. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You're going down there? <br>
JANEWAY: If somebody survived this catastrophe they might need our
help. Get a good fix on those coordinates. I don't want to beam into
solid rock. Seven, Tuvok, You're with me. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
These walls have been reinforced with tritonium. They built this place
to last. <br>
TUVOK: Most of the power relays are still active. <br>
JANEWAY: Not bad after nine centuries. <br>
SEVEN: The main reactor is drawing energy from the planet's geothermal
core. Efficient.<br>TUVOK:
Some kind of stasis pod. <br>
SEVEN: This display indicates that there are more chambers behind these
walls. Some of them have failed. <br>
JANEWAY: It's amazing they survived at all. Let's see what else we can
find. <br>(Seven looks at Gedrin asleep in his bio-pod, then goes to its controls. She taps at the alien symbols, and the pod opens.)<br>JANEWAY: Seven, what are you doing? <br>
SEVEN: I've activated the reanimation sequence. He may be able to
provide us with answers. <br>
TUVOK: We don't know anything about this species. They could be
hostile. <br>
SEVEN: Most humanoid cultures are. <br>
JANEWAY: Remind me to reacquaint you with away mission protocols. <br>(Gedrin wakes as Janeway is scanning him. She puts her tricorder away and gets out her phaser.)<br>
GEDRIN: Who<br>
JANEWAY: It's all right. We're not your enemy. We're from a starship.
We discovered this chamber and revived you. <br>
GEDRIN: How long was I <br>
JANEWAY: In stasis? Close to nine hundred years. <br>
GEDRIN: Nine hundred? Jisa. Help her, please. <br>(Seven goes to the other bio-pod and activates it. Gedrin totters over and gazes at a dessicated corpse.)<br>GEDRIN: No, Jisa. She was my
wife. </font></p>

won't hurt you. <br>
GEDRIN: I was drifting in and out of consciousness when they brought me
here, but I thought I saw you appear out of thin air. <br>
EMH: I'm a computer programme. A hologram. <br>
GEDRIN: And the others? <br>(Janeway and Seven enter.)<br>
EMH: Flesh and blood, like yourself. <br>
GEDRIN: You're the ones that took me out of stasis. I don't recognise
your species. <br>
JANEWAY: Human. Our home planet is halfway across the galaxy. <br>
GEDRIN: And you've expanded your territory into this space? <br>
JANEWAY: Our ship was brought here by accident. We're trying to get
home. <br>
GEDRIN: You're Borg. <br>
SEVEN: How do you know that? <br>
GEDRIN: Don't you recognise my people? The Vaadwaur? <br>
SEVEN: The Collective's memory from nine hundred years ago is
fragmentary. <br>
GEDRIN: I've had many encounters with your kind. <br>
EMH: And lived to tell about them? Impressive. <br>
GEDRIN: How did you find us? <br>
JANEWAY: We needed someplace to hide from the Turei after they found us
in one of their subspace corridors. <br>
GEDRIN: Their corridors? <br>
JANEWAY: So they claimed. <br>
GEDRIN: The corridors were ours. It took centuries to map them. We were
the envy of a hundred species, including the Turei. <br>
JANEWAY: Are they responsible for what happened to your planet? <br>
GEDRIN: The Turei, and a dozen others. What one couldn't accomplish the
others finally did. I would like to look at what's left of my world. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">GEDRIN:
We made our final stand there. <br>
JANEWAY: I've scanned the cavern. You've got a thousand more stasis
pods down there, most of them still active. Hundreds of ships, land
vehicles, weapons. <br>
GEDRIN: A single battalion, and their families. We had planned to come
out of stasis after five years. We believed that by then, the Alliance
would have been at each other's throats. <br>
JANEWAY: You were going to rebuild? <br>
GEDRIN: No, not here. We knew this planet would be poisoned for
centuries. We were planning to go to another world, start a colony,
hope to find new allies, learn from them. <br>
JANEWAY: Your power core is still functioning. It was the controls that
were damaged in the attack. That's why you never came out of stasis. <br>
GEDRIN: Jisa and I lived there in the old quarter. We had a garden
overlooking the street below. It's a shame she didn't show more courage
at the end. <br>
JANEWAY: Given the circumstances <br>
GEDRIN: That's no excuse. <br>
JANEWAY: Pardon me for saying this, but that seems a bit heartless. <br>
GEDRIN: When it rains, do you run from doorway to doorway trying to stay
dry, getting wet all the while. Or do you just accept the fact that
it's raining, and walk with dignity? <br>
JANEWAY: Rain's one thing. Plasma bombs are something else. <br>
GEDRIN: But the principle is the same. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd bring an umbrella. <br>
GEDRIN: Maybe it's not too late to meet a new ally and learn from her. <br>
NEELIX: I took the liberty of preparing a large assortment of Delta
Quadrant dishes. Hopefully, there's something here that you'll like. <br>
GEDRIN: You're Talax-ilzay. <br>
NEELIX: Talaxian, but you're right. My ancestors referred to themselves
as Talax-ilzay in the old tongue. <br>
GEDRIN: The old tongue was new when I met your race. <br>
JANEWAY: You travelled all the way to Talaxia? <br>
GEDRIN: And farther. Our corridors took us to many worlds. I'm curious.
Have you heard of us, the Vaadwaur? <br>
NEELIX: Oh, I'm afraid there aren't many records from that period, but
vaadwaur is a word in the old tongue. It means foolish. <br>
I'm sure that it's just a coincidence, of course. I didn't mean to be
rude. <br>
GEDRIN: Your ancestors were wise. Only fools would let this happen to
them. <br>(A missile hits the surface and explodes.)<br>

CHAKOTAY: Six Turei vessels are in orbit, all firing plasma charges. <br>
TUVOK: That was two thousand metres to starboard. <br>
KIM: Looks like they can't get an exact fix on our position. The
radiogenic atmosphere must be disrupting their targeting. <br>
TUVOK: Nine hundred metres. <br>
PARIS: They're getting closer. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We have the same problem. Our torpedoes won't lock on. <br>
TUVOK: Direct hit. Aft shields down to eighteen percent. <br>
GEDRIN: Captain? Can you transmit a signal through this atmosphere? <br>
JANEWAY: We've already tried talking to them. <br>
GEDRIN: I have no intention of speaking with the Turei. We put a sentry
satellite in orbit directly above the city. You could use its sensors
to help guide your torpedoes. <br>
TUVOK: It's there. Intact and functional. <br>
GEDRIN: Open a channel. I'll give you the activation code. <br>(Gedrin does not understand Starfleet consoles.)<br>GEDRIN: I'm a few
centuries out of date. <br>
KIM: You can enter the activation code here. It's processing our
telemetry. <br>
JANEWAY: Triangulate. Fire. <br>
TUVOK: Direct hit. The lead ship has lost shields. Its propulsion is
down. <br>
GEDRIN: One more torpedo will finish them. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The other ships are retreating. <br>
GEDRIN: Captain, why don't you keep firing? <br>
JANEWAY: We scared them off. That's enough for now. <br>
GEDRIN: But they'll come back with twice as many ships. <br>
JANEWAY: With any luck, our warp drive will be back online by then. <br>
GEDRIN: The Turei may be cowards, but their technology has become much
more advanced than ours. If you leave us, we will be slaughtered again.
<br>
CHAKOTAY: What do you propose? <br>
GEDRIN: Help us off this planet, and we will show you subspace
corridors known to nobody else. You will be free from the Turei, and
you will be a thousand light years closer to your home. <br>

GEDRIN: The corridors occur naturally, but they're very unstable.
They're damaged by use. <br>
GAUL: Obviously the Turei don't have the wisdom to maintain them
properly. They'll be very difficult to navigate after centuries of
neglect. <br>
TUVOK: We've only been able to chart a few of the corridors. Can you
provide us with a more complete map? <br>
MORIN: We've never kept written records, for security reasons. Of
course, we've committed all the corridors to memory. Every multifold,
every spatial intersect. <br>

GAUL: The Turei would like nothing more than to find the rest of our
subspace corridors. We can't allow that to happen. <br>
TUVOK: Then I suggest we use the element of surprise. At oh six
hundred, Voyager will leave the surface and engage the Turei ships in
orbit. As we draw their fire, the more powerful Vaadwaur vessels will
attack from multiple vectors. The rest of the Vaadwaur will break orbit
from the opposite side of the planet and proceed to the subspace
corridors. We'll rendezvous with them afterwards. <br>

This is an M class planet in orbit of a type G star. We've located a
subcontinent with edible vegetation and an underground water supply.
Unfortunately, the region is subject to windstorms. <br>
GEDRIN: Not exactly paradise. <br>
SEVEN: You will adapt. <br>
GEDRIN: Practical and to the point, just like my wife. She had a knack
for cutting to the truth. <br>
SEVEN: She must have been an efficient individual. <br>
GEDRIN: To say the least. You would have enjoyed her company. You are
not at all like the Borg I knew. <br>
SEVEN: As a drone, I helped assimilate many civilisations. Now I have
the opportunity to help reconstruct one. I find the experience
gratifying. <br>
GEDRIN: So do I. I'm curious. Has your crew ever considered finding a
planet of their own? A place to settle down? <br>
SEVEN: Captain Janeway is committed to getting Voyager back to Earth. <br>
GEDRIN: That could take decades, and there are many dangers ahead. <br>
SEVEN: We will adapt. <br>
GEDRIN: I suppose you will. <br>
NEELIX [OC]: Neelix to Seven of Nine. <br>
SEVEN: Yes? <br>
NEELIX [OC]: Could I see you in Cargo Bay two? It's important. <br>
SEVEN: Acknowledged. <br>
GEDRIN: I'm due for a final briefing with your Mister Tuvok. <br>
SEVEN: I'll accompany you to the bridge. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Cargo
Bay two]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">NEELIX:
I'm sorry to bother you, but I've been doing some research on our new
allies and I have found something very interesting. In dozens of the
ancient folktales of my people, there's a common theme. They describe a
phantom army that appears out of thin air, destroys entire colonies,
and vanishes in the blink of an eye. Sound familiar? <br>
SEVEN: The subspace corridors. <br>
NEELIX: Exactly. Gedrin claims they've been using them as trade routes
but I'm starting to wonder. <br>
SEVEN: Your source material is folktales, Mister Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: But many fables have a basis in reality. You've got the
collective knowledge of thousands of species. You could cross-reference
my findings. It'll only take a few minutes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Ready

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Janeway sips her coffee and the doorbell chimes.)<br>JANEWAY:
Come in. <br>
GEDRIN: You wanted to see me, Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: Yes. I need a little history lesson. <br>
GEDRIN: Can't it wait until after we've reached the corridors? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm afraid not. I've just had a conversation with Mister
Neelix and Seven of Nine. They've been poring through various databases
and ha've come up with some surprising findings. <br>
GEDRIN: Surprising? <br>
JANEWAY: You told me the Vaadwaur were a culture of merchants and
scientists who expanded their knowledge by using subspace corridors to
travel to other worlds. You were the envy of hundreds of species, some
of whom eventually wanted the corridors for themselves. <br>
GEDRIN: Your point? <br>
JANEWAY: Let me give you another version of events. The Vaadwaur were
an aggressive culture who expanded their territory by using the
corridors to attack other worlds, until some of those worlds banded
together to defend themselves and put an end to the Vaadwaur threat
once and for all. Would you care to set the record straight? <br>
GEDRIN: That was nine hundred years ago. <br>
JANEWAY: If we're going to be fighting side by side, I have to trust
you. I need to be certain you don't have any ulterior motives. <br>
GEDRIN: Our only motive is survival. <br>
JANEWAY: If I were to take you at your word, the ancient Talaxians
might call me vaadwaur. Foolish. That's what they came to call anyone
who allowed themselves to be deceived by an enemy. There are hundreds
of other references just like it. <br>
GEDRIN: Both versions of our history are true. We did use the corridors
to explore and, on occasion, expand our territory. But Captain, we have
gone from a population of six billion to six hundred. Our weapons are
archaic. Do you really think that we are prepared to declare war on the
Delta Quadrant? <br>
JANEWAY: Not yet, but right now it's Voyager I'm worried about. The
Turei are going to be firing everything they've got at my ship. You
might try to take advantage of that. <br>
GEDRIN: What are you going to do, put us all back into stasis? <br>
JANEWAY: We said we'd try to help you make a new start, and I want to
keep that promise. But I can't ignore history, Mister Gedrin. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Make yourself comfortable, Mister Gedrin. Chakotay, I don't know
whether to believe him or not. What I wouldn't give for a Betazoid
about now. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If Mister Neelix is right, we should be ready for anything.
Their technology may be outdated, but it can still do a lot of damage. <br>
JANEWAY: Agreed. Maintain a full security alert and have Tuvok keep a
weapons lock on their primary reactor. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Are we still proceeding at oh six hundred hours? <br>
JANEWAY: Yes, but with a few modifications. What's Mister Gaul's
location? <br>
KIM: He's in the central chamber. <br>
JANEWAY: Hail him. <br>
GAUL [on viewscreen]: Captain, we've reactivated seventy three assault
vessels. Our pilots are standing by. <br>
JANEWAY: I need to inform you about a change of plan. I want you to
deactivate the particle cannons on all but ten of your assault vessels.
Then we'll proceed on schedule. <br>
GAUL [on viewscreen]: I don't understand. <br>
JANEWAY: Only ten of your ships are going to engage the Turei. The
others will head directly for the subspace corridors. I see no reason
for those to be armed. <br>
GAUL [on viewscreen]: Something could go wrong. Why leave them
defenceless? <br>
JANEWAY: Voyager will defend them. <br>
GAUL [on viewscreen]: What prompted this change? <br>
JANEWAY: You haven't been completely honest about your past, and that
makes me a little uncertain about the present. <br>
GAUL [on viewscreen]: Gedrin. <br>
GEDRIN: I suggest you listen to her. <br>
GAUL [on viewscreen]: Request denied, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: It's not a request. You can call it an ultimatum if you like. <br>
GAUL [on viewscreen]: Unacceptable. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm going to leave this planet in one hour, with or without
you. <br>
GAUL [on viewscreen]: We did not spend nine hundred years in stasis to
take orders from you.

I don't know about the rest of you but I'm ready to get moving. What's
our status? <br>
PARIS: Impulse engines are online. <br>
TUVOK: Shields at maximum. Weapons standing by. <br>
JANEWAY: Tom, prepare to initiate the ascent sequence in <br>(The ground shakes.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Report! <br>
KIM: Massive energy readings coming from the central chamber. <br>
TUVOK: It's the Vaadwaur. They're launching the first wave of ships.
Seventeen vessels have broken through the surface. They're at an
altitude of two thousand metres and charging weapons. &nbsp;<br>
PARIS: Ma'am, they're not ascending into orbit. They're heading
straight for Voyager. <br>
JANEWAY: Tom?<br>
PARIS: Engaging thrusters. Initiating ascent sequence. <br>
TUVOK: Vaadwaur ships approaching off our starboard bow. <br>
JANEWAY: Target phasers, full spread. <br>
PARIS: We're airborne. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What altitude do we need on this planet, Tom, before we can
go to warp? <br>
PARIS: We'll have to clear the thermosphere. Two hundred and eighty
kilometres at least. <br>
TUVOK: Shields at ninety two percent. <br>
JANEWAY: Phasers. <br>
TUVOK: We've disabled four of their ships. <br>
CHAKOTAY: They've launched another thirty nine vessels. <br>
JANEWAY: Evasive manoeuvres. <br>
PARIS: It's no use. They're closing on all sides. <br>KIM: Direct hit to the
port thrusters. <br>PARIS: We're losing altitude. <br>
JANEWAY: Reroute emergency power. We need to get into orbit. <br>
TUVOK: Targeting sensors offline. Switching to manual. <br>
JANEWAY: Harry, can you open a secure channel to the Turei ships in
orbit? <br>
KIM: Yes, ma'am, but that would give away our position. They could lock
on with plasma charges. <br>
JANEWAY: I think it's time we reacquaint a couple of old friends. Hail
them. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
We've got nine more fighters on our tail. <br>
TUVOK: Aft shields down to twenty percent. <br>
KIM: Captain, the Turei are responding. <br>
JANEWAY: Put them through. <br>
TUREI [on viewscreen]: What do you want? <br>
JANEWAY: I've got a proposition for you. <rb>
&nbsp;<br>
TUREI [on viewscreen]: No more talk. Prepare to be bordered. <br>
JANEWAY: Tell me, have you been picking up weapons fire? <br>
TUREI [on viewscreen]: We have detected some unusual energy signatures,
yes. <br>
JANEWAY: That's because we're under attack by the Vaadwaur. <br>
TUREI [on viewscreen]: Impossible. They were destroyed centuries ago. <br>
GEDRIN: Some of us have survived. <br>
JANEWAY: They've got over two hundred ships. They said something about
wanting their subspace corridors back. I suggest we join forces and try
to neutralise the threat here and now. What's more important to you?
Deleting the records of a Federation ship that means you no harm, or
defending yourselves against hundreds of Vaadwaur fighters who are
determined to invade your underspace? I suggest you pick your enemy. <br>
TUREI: Our sensors can't penetrate the atmosphere. How can we fight an
enemy we can't see? <br>
CHAKOTAY: We have access to one of their surveillance satellites. We
could use it to transmit their vital coordinates to you. <br>
TUREI [on viewscreen]: If this is a deception <br>
KIM: I'm having trouble establishing a link with the satellite. Our
sensor array took heavy damage. <br>
GEDRIN: I could access it from the underground control chamber.
Transport me there. Not all of my people are stuck in the past,
Captain. <br>

stasis. In a few hundred years, maybe someone will be kind enough to
revive them. <br>(Debris falls from the ceiling.)<br>GAUL: What is that? <br>
MORIN: It's a plasma charge. It came from orbit. It's the Turei.
They've isolated our location. <br>

JANEWAY: How about emergency power? <br>
KIM: Barely enough for life support, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Harry, the radiogenic particles in the atmosphere. Could we
use them as a power source? <br>
KIM: We'd have to modify the warp core's conversion matrix. It could
take hours. <br>
JANEWAY: What if we drew the particles directly into our plasma
manifold? <br>
PARIS: That would give us one hell of a boost. <br>
KIM: It could also blow out every power relay on the ship. <br>
