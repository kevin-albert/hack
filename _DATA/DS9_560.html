makes him uncomfortable? <br>
EZRI: Like what? <br>
ROM: Like how's your new leg? <br>
EZRI: I think he's probably expecting a few questions. <br>
ROM: I just don't want to say the wrong thing. <br>
LEETA: You'll be fine. But maybe I shouldn't be there when he arrives. <br>
EZRI: Why? <br>
LEETA: Well, when he was in the hospital, he didn't answer any of my
letters. That's okay. I'm only his stepmother. But he's going through
something so personal maybe he only wants his real family around. <br>
ROM: You are real family. </font></p>

Yes, Nog has lost a leg and that's a traumatic experience, but nothing
you do or say or do is going to be worse than what he's already gone
through. Just be happy to see him and tell him you love him. For today,
that'll be enough. <br>
KIRA: They've docked. <br>

SISKO: Colonel, are you sure this is the right transport? <br>
KIRA: I checked the passenger list this morning. He definitely boarded

applause.) <br>
KIRA: Welcome back, Nog. <br>
EZRI: Welcome back. <br>
ROM: Hello. <br>
LEETA: Welcome home, Nog.&nbsp;<br>
NOG: Thank you. It's good to be back. My orders, Captain. <br>
SISKO: (reads the PADD) Medical leave? How could that be? <br>
O'BRIEN: Sounds like an excuse to loaf around while the rest of us
work. <br>
BASHIR: Hard work and plenty of it, that's what I prescribe. <br>
ODO: Captain, maybe he forged those orders. <br>
SISKO: I'm afraid they're genuine. Ensign Nog has no duties until
further notice. Except to attend a welcome home party in the wardroom. <br>
NOG: If it's all the same to you, sir, I'm rather tired. I'd rather
just go to my quarters. Is that all right? <br>
EZRI: Absolutely. We can celebrate once you've settled in. <br>
NOG: Great. <br>

EZRI: And Julian and Miles have become even more obsessed with their
Alamo programme, if you can believe it. I half expect Miles to start
wearing a coonskin cap to work. You see, Davy Crockett wore this cap
made of a raccoon skin and <br>
NOG: I know the programme. <br>
EZRI: Oh. Well, I think we've covered just about everything you missed
while you were away. Is there anything you want to talk about? <br>
NOG: Not particularly. Here it comes. <br>
EZRI: What? <br>
NOG: The cane problem. You're about to ask me why I need to walk with
the cane since Doctor Benbasset told you my biosynthetic leg works
perfectly. He also told you the problem's all in my head. That I'm
crazy. <br>
EZRI: He didn't say that. <br>
NOG: It's what he thinks. <br>
EZRI: Forget what he thinks. What do you think? Why do you need the
cane? <br>
NOG: My leg hurts. And if I put my full weight on it, it hurts more. So
I have to limp. And that means I need to walk with a cane. <br>
EZRI: Sounds reasonable to me. <br>
NOG: Good. Look, can I be perfectly honest with you? I've spent the
last three weeks talking about my feelings with the counsellors on
Starbase two three five and to tell you the truth, I'm a little sick of
it. I just want to be left alone for a while. <br>
EZRI: I understand. I think we've done enough for today. I'll see you
tomorrow. <br>

appointments. <br>
EZRI: And his counselling sessions have been going nowhere. In his
words, he's sick of talking about his feelings. I can't say I blame
him. He's been under constant psychiatric care for almost two months
now. <br>
SISKO: What should do we do? <br>
EZRI: I'm not sure. For now, I think our best bet is to simply watch
and wait. <br>
SISKO: Not my first choice. <br>

that same stupid song for three days. I can't take it anymore. Aren't
you going to say anything? You've barely said three words to me since
you came home. <br>
NOG: Maybe I don't have anything to say. <br>
JAKE: I'm trying to help you here, Nog, but you're not making it easy. <br>
NOG: You want to help me? Fine. Leave me alone. <br>
JAKE: All right. Okay. But if you want to hear that song again, go rent

VIC: He's really proud of you. He's always in here bragging about his
son, the soldier boy. <br>
NOG: Yeah. <br>
VIC: What can I do for you? <br>
NOG: I want to hear 'I'll Be Seeing You'. <br>
VIC: Sure thing, kiddo. Any other requests? <br>
NOG: No. Just 'I'll Be Seeing You.' <br>

BASHIR: It's a song that I had Vic Fontaine record for me. <br>
NOG: Vic? <br>
BASHIR: Yes, he's a character in a holosuite programme of mine. I
thought it might take our minds off our troubles. Is it bothering you? <br>

arrangements of that tune and you've heard 'em all. Now, which one's
your favourite? <br>
NOG: The first. <br>
VIC: Somehow, I knew you were going to say that. So let me guess.
Julian played it for you, right? <br>
NOG: Right. <br>
VIC: If I had him as a publicist, I'd be bigger than Elvis. <br>
NOG: Who? <br>
VIC: Never mind. So, how's the new leg? <br>
NOG: You know about that? <br>
VIC: People talk. <br>
NOG: If you really want to know, it hurts. <br>
VIC: Can they give you something for that? <br>
NOG: No. They say it's all in my head. According to my tricorder, the
pain receptors in your leg aren't being stimulated, Nog. You must be
imagining it. I don't care what they say. It hurts all the time. <br>
VIC: I believe you. <br>
NOG: You're the only one. <br>
VIC: So what else can I do for you? Sing it again? <br>
NOG: No. <br>
VIC: Good. To tell you the truth, I was starting to get a little sick
of it myself. How about something else? <br>
NOG: No. I just want to go to bed. <br>

NOG: Yeah. <br>
VIC: Something wrong? <br>
NOG: I don't want to go back to my quarters. Actually, I don't want to
go back to my life. Vic, where do you live? In the programme, I mean.
Do you have a house or? <br>
VIC: I have a suite here in the hotel. <br>
NOG: Do you have an extra room? <br>
VIC: Sure. You want to stay with me tonight? <br>
NOG: Maybe more than just tonight. Officially, I'm on medical leave,
and according to regulations I can choose my rehabilitation facility. <br>
VIC: You want to choose a holosuite programme for your rehab? <br>

staying with me. <br>

ROM: He's a one-legged crazy man! <br>
EZRI: He is not crazy. <br>
SISKO: But he is living in a holosuite. <br>
EZRI: At first, it struck me as a little peculiar. But after I thought
it over, I began to think that this might be a good sign after all. <br>
QUARK: How can hiding in one of Julian's adolescent programmes be a
good sign? <br>
BASHIR: Hey. <br>
JAKE: It could be worse. He could be hiding in the Alamo programme. <br>
LEETA: Or that ridiculous secret agent programme. <br>
BASHIR: Hey. <br>
ROM: Or that stupid Viking programme. <br>
BASHIR: Hey! <br>
SISKO: All right. Are you sure this is in Nog's best interest? <br>
EZRI: No, I'm not sure. But I think Nog might be subconsciously trying
to seek out his own form of therapy. <br>
JAKE: I'm sorry, but moving into a holosuite isn't my idea of therapy. <br>
EZRI: Okay, it sounds a little odd. <br>
QUARK: It sounds ridiculous. <br>
BASHIR: Not really. I'm inclined to agree with Ezri on this one. The
mind has a strong natural instinct for survival. Now, for whatever
reason, Nog's mind has chosen to take shelter in the world of Vic
Fontaine. <br>
EZRI: I think we should wait and see how this plays out. <br>
SISKO: Then someone should talk to Vic, make him aware of Nog's
emotional and physical condition. <br>
EZRI: I'll do it. <br>

am. <br>

does. <br>
EZRI: I'm positive. It's a psychological need, not a physical one. <br>

can spend it
wherever he chooses. <br>
EZRI: How do you know that? <br>
NOG: I told him. And if you try to force me to leave, I'll resign my
commission. <br>
EZRI: Wait a minute. Let's slow down here. No one's talking about
forcing anyone to do anything. <br>
NOG: Good. Because Vic and I have big plans. <br>
VIC: We do? <br>
NOG: I've been going over your books, and this place is a latinum mine
and you don't even know it. In my opinion, it's time to expand the
business. <br>
EZRI: Nog, this is a holosuite. <br>
NOG: Of course it's a holosuite. That doesn't mean we can't build a new
casino. <br>
VIC: A new casino? How much money do I have? <br>
NOG: If you'll excuse us, Counsellor, we have business to conduct. <br>
(With the title song 'It's Only A Paper Moon' in the background, we
move into a series of montages. - Blueprints are drawn up, accounts are
worked on, films are watched on TV while eating popcorn, Nog lights a
lady's cigarette with his replica cane, the business section of the Las
Vegas Register is read, Ezri notices Nog greeting the customers whilst
holding and not leaning on his cane.) <br>
NOG: Go easy on the garnishes. People order a drink, they don't want a
fruit bowl in their glass. We'll talk about this later. <br>
(Moon River instrumental in the background.) <br>
WAITRESS: Good evening. <br>
NOG: I'll take care of them. Hey, long time, no see. <br>
ROM: Hi. <br>
LEETA: Oh, Nog! <br>
NOG: Right this way. <br>
LEETA: So, how are you? <br>
NOG: Couldn't be better. Business is booming. We're making money hand
over fist. I can hardly keep up with all the profits. <br>
ROM: Those are holographic profits, right? <br>
NOG: Yeah. So, what's new with you? <br>
LEETA: Well, Rom got a promotion. <br>
ROM: Maintenance Engineer, First Class. <br>
NOG: That's great! Congratulations, Dad! <br>
ROM: Thanks. <br>
NOG: We should celebrate. We'll close the lounge, have a private party.
<br>
LEETA: Actually, Chief O'Brien threw him a party last night. <br>
NOG: Oh. <br>
LEETA: It was a spur of the moment thing. No invitations or anything. <br>
NOG: Don't worry about it. I probably couldn't have gotten away. Last
night was really busy. Oh. A big player just walked in. Excuse me a
minute. I need to go schmooze. <br>
ROM: Okay. See you later. <br>
LEETA: Bye. <br>
(At the bar.) <br>
VIC: Hey, I hope you're still talking to me. <br>
EZRI: Of course I am. I got to hand it to you, Vic, you've done a great
job with him. He seems like a new man. <br>
VIC: He just needed a little time, that's all. <br>
EZRI: Heals all wounds, right? Giving him that cane was a great idea. I
haven't seen him limp in days. <br>
VIC: It gets better. Yesterday we drove out to see the architect who's
designing the new casino. I saw him actually run up a flight of stairs.
<br>
EZRI: No kidding. <br>
VIC: Would I kid a kidder? <br>
EZRI: So, what's next for you two? <br>
VIC: We don't break ground on the casino for about a week, so I thought
we'd fly up to Tahoe for a couple of days. Sammy's going to be
performing at the Cal Neva and I thought I'd introduce the kid to him. <br>
EZRI: Sammy's a friend of yours? <br>
VIC: We're tight. <br>
EZRI: I see. You're going to get Sammy convince him that it's time to
leave the holosuite? <br>
VIC: Well, no. <br>
EZRI: Forget it. I should know better by now than to ask you to give
away your secrets. You probably have the whole thing all mapped out. I
mean, what am I thinking? That this new casino is anything more than a
ploy? That you'd actually let him live out the rest of his life in a
holosuite? <br>
VIC: No, of course not, I mean. The casino's just a ploy, like you
said, you know. <br>
EZRI: They'll be so glad to have him back. <br>
VIC: Yeah. He is better, isn't he. <br>
EZRI: It's like you said. He just needed a break from reality. Now all
that's left is to decide when he's ready to go back. But I'll leave
that up to you. See you around. <br>
VIC: See you.

enters.) <br>
NOG: Great set tonight, Vic. <br>
VIC: Thanks. Lot of familiar faces in the crowd. Did I see Rom and
Leeta out there? <br>
NOG: They came for a while. What do you think about moving the crap
tables over to the south wing and expanding the slot machines out into
here? <br>
VIC: Good idea. (Vic rolls up the blueprints.) I'll think it over. <br>
NOG: But we're supposed to meet with the architect tomorrow morning. <br>
VIC: Not anymore. It's time for you to go, kid. <br>
NOG: Go where? <br>
VIC: You know where. It's time to end the programme. <br>
NOG: But we've got work to do. We have a casino to build. <br>
VIC: No, we don't. This is just a fantasy. It's not real. <br>
NOG: It's real to me and it's real to you, and don't say it isn't. I
know better. <br>
VIC: You're right, it's very real to me. But I'm a hologram, Nog. I'm
not a person. Until you came along, I'd never been on for more than six
or seven hours straight. <br>
NOG: I know. And now you're running all the time. Isn't it great? <br>
VIC: It's incredible. Since you've been here, I've slept in a bed every
night, gone to work every day, had time to read the paper, play cards
with the boys. I've had a life. And I have to tell you, it's a precious
thing. I had no idea how much it means to just live. Now I'm going to
return the favour and give you your life back. <br>
NOG: But I don't want that life anymore, Vic. I'm perfectly happy here.
<br>
VIC: What here? There is no here. Don't you get it? This is nowhere.
It's an illusion and so am I. In fact, the only thing in this entire
programme that is not an illusion is you. <br>
NOG: Okay. You're right. But I'm not ready to go back yet. I need more
time. So let's just sleep on this and talk about it tomorrow. <br>
VIC: Kid, I hate to do this to you, but you're not giving me any
choice. Computer <br>
NOG: No, don't! <br>
VIC: End programme.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Nog is working in a control panel.) <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh. Hi, Nog. <br>
NOG: Chief. Something wrong? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, no. I was running a diagnostic in Ops and I noticed a
magnetic flux anomaly in the holosuite transilluminator circuits. I
didn't realise it was you. <br>
NOG: Sorry. I'm just having trouble getting the Las Vegas programme to
run. <br>
O'BRIEN: You know, Vic's matrix is a little different than your
standard photokinetic hologram. He can turn himself off. And if he
doesn't want to appear, he doesn't appear. <br>
NOG: You mean he has free will? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm an engineer, not a philosopher. All I know is that when
Vic turns himself off, he's off, and ripping out the guts of the
holosuite isn't going to change that. Anything else I can do for you? <br>
NOG: No. <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh, we, er, we all miss you in Ops. <br>
NOG: Yeah. <br>
(O'Brien leaves) <br>
VIC: So, now that the Chief's told you I'm smarter than the average
bear, will you stop messing around with my holosuite? <br>
NOG: If you'll turn the programme back on. <br>
VIC: What is it I'm not making clear to you, Charlie? You got to go. <br>
NOG: Don't you get it? I can't go out there. <br>
VIC: Why not? <br>
NOG: I'm scared, okay? I'm scared. When the war began, I wasn't happy
or anything, but I was eager. I wanted to test myself. I wanted to
prove I had what it took to be a soldier. And I saw a lot of combat. I
saw a lot of people get hurt. I saw a lot of people die, but I didn't
think anything was going to happen to me. And then suddenly Doctor
Bashir is telling me he has to cut my leg off. I couldn't believe it. I
still can't believe it. If I can get shot, if I can lose my leg,
anything could happen to me, Vic. I could die tomorrow. I don't know if
I'm ready to face that. If I stay here, at least I know what the future
is going to be like. <br>
VIC: You stay here, you're going to die. Not all at once, but little by
little. Eventually you'll become as hollow as I am. <br>
NOG: You don't seem hollow to me. <br>
VIC: Compared to you, I'm hollow as a snare drum. Look, kid, I don't
know what's going to happen to you out there. All I can tell you is
that you've got to play the cards life deals you. Sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose, but at least you're in the game. <br>
