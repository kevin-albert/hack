<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(We are back in the land of black and white Saturday afternoon serials at the cinema.)<br>NARRATOR:
The Adventures of Captain Proton! Chapter Eighteen: Bride of Chaotica! The
evil Doctor Chaotica kidnaps Constance Goodheart and plans to sacrifice
her to Arachnia, Queen of the Spider People. (Constance screams, Chaotica laughs.) Captain Proton travels
millions of miles to Planet X where he will invade the Fortress of
Doom. Chaotica fires his fiendish Death Ray. Certain death for Proton
as his rocket ship bursts into flames.<br>KIM: We
didn't burst into flames in the last chapter. Why are these recaps
always so inaccurate? <br>
PARIS: Well, they brought people back to the theatres. <br>
KIM: Cliff-hangers. <br>
PARIS: The lost art of hyperbole. You ready? <br>
KIM: Aye, Captain. <br>
PARIS: Let's get this show on the road. Computer, begin Chapter Eighteen. <br>
KIM: We're receiving a transmission. It's Chaotica. <br>
PARIS: Imagising. <br>
CHAOTICA [on imagiser]: Captain Proton. Surrender! <br>
PARIS: Not a chance. Release Miss Goodheart and we'll be on our way. <br>
CHAOTICA [on imagiser]: I'm afraid your secretary has already been
promised to Queen
Arachnia as a Supreme Sacrifice. <br>(Constance screams.) <br>
KIM: You'll never get away with this. <br>
CHAOTICA [on imagiser]: Oh, ho ho ho, but I shall. You escaped from my
Death Ray once, but you won't survive this! <br>
KIM: He's charging the weapon. <br>
PARIS: Brace for impact. <br>
KIM: Direct hit. We lost both engines.&nbsp;<br>

KIM: Opening hatch. <br>
PARIS: Welcome to Planet X. <br>
KIM: What's the plan? <br>
PARIS: This is the part where we defeat Chaotica's soldiers, steal
their uniforms, and make our way through the underground caverns. <br>
KIM: Hey, I thought you said there were slave girls in this chapter. <br>
PARIS: After we infiltrate the Fortress of Doom, we'll free Chaotica's
harem. Let's go. <br>

time. Ah, behold the Fortress of Doom. <br>

JANEWAY: Cause? <br>
TUVOK: Unknown. Engines are operational. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm reading gravimetric forces around the ship. They're
disrupting our power flow. <br>TUVOK: Control systems are going offline. I
no longer have access to communications, deflector, weapons. <br>

believe I have an explanation. Sensors show that we've entered a layer
of subspace. It's disrupting our warp field. <br>
JANEWAY: Do we have impulse? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes <br>
JANEWAY: Engage at full. <br>
TUVOK: No change in our position. <br>
JANEWAY: Route all available power to the engines. <br>
TUVOK: We're not moving. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The impulse reactor's running hot. We're heading for an
overload. <br>
JANEWAY: Give it all she's got. Full thrusters. <br>
CHAKOTAY: No effect. Reactors are critical. <br>
JANEWAY: Abort. Increase power to the structural integrity field. We
may be here awhile.

It's no use. I can't disengage the programme. <br>
KIM: Well, you better think of something fast, Proton. A second
distortion just appeared. Whatever they are, they're getting bigger. <br>
PARIS: Hold on. I've got access to the transporter. I'm going to try a
site to site. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
I've run a trans-spectral analysis. The area between space and subspace
is unstable throughout this region. <br>
TORRES: Basically, we've run aground on a subspace sandbar. I've tried
realigning the warp field, reversing hull polarity. <br>
PARIS: Maybe we should just get out and push. <br>
SEVEN: The gravimetric forces are disrupting our control systems. <br>
TORRES: As long as we're trapped here we won't have access to the
computer core, tactical, holodecks, and all but six replicators. <br>
JANEWAY: What about those distortions on the holodeck? What's the
connection? <br>
SEVEN: They appear to be random energy fluctuations. I don't believe
they post a threat. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's keep an eye on them anyway, and evacuate that deck just
to be safe. A few years back, when I was a science officer on the
Al-Batani, we tried to navigate a dense protonebula. It stopped us
dead in our tracks. For three days we attempted to force our way out,
until we realised we were trying too hard. <br>
TORRES: Captain? <br>
JANEWAY: Every time we engaged the engines, we were increasing the
resistance of the nebula's particle field. We may be facing a similar
situation. <br>
SEVEN: Our own warp field may be increasing the gravimetric forces. If
we power down the core and use minimal thrusters, we might be able to
break free. <br>
JANEWAY: You took the words right out of my mouth. <br>
SEVEN: Your plan could work. <br>
TORRES: Now that we have your blessing. <br>

ALIEN: To contact other photonic lifeforms. To learn from them. <br>
CHAOTICA: Are you alone or are you the vanguard of an invading army? <br>
ALIEN: We are explorers. <br>
CHAOTICA: I am growing weary of this charade. Your armies will be no
match for my space force. We'll crush you like insects. <br>
ALIEN: They are hostile. This contact should be terminated. <br>
CHAOTICA: Indeed. Lonzak, execute them. <br>(Lonzak obliterates one alien, the other has himself beamed away. Constance screams, of course.)<br>CHAOTICA: Coward. He'll learn there's no
escape from Chaotica. Gather my Space Force. Power the Death Ray. <br>

We've only got four functioning lavatories for a ship of a hundred and
fifty people. <br>
JANEWAY: I see. <br>
NEELIX: Needless to say, lines are beginning to form. If we don't get
unstuck soon we may have a serious problem on our hands. Especially
with the Bolians. All but three sonic showers are offline, too. In

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Let me get this straight. Transdimensional aliens have mistaken your
Captain Proton simulation for reality. <br>
PARIS: Yes, ma'am. <br>
JANEWAY: And now an armed conflict has broken out between these aliens
and Chaotica's holographic army. <br>
PARIS: Yes, ma'am. His Army of Evil. <br>
JANEWAY: And will someone please explain why we haven't simply shut
down the holodeck? <br>
SEVEN: We've tried. The controls are still offline. <br>
JANEWAY: We're going to have to get through to these aliens somehow and explain
that they're fighting shadows. <br>
PARIS: We've tried, but they don't believe us. They think that we're
not real. They can't detect Voyager, so every time they scan us we seem
as artificial to them as holographic characters do to us. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That explains why they haven't answered our hails. <br>
SEVEN: The Doctor is photonic. He may be able to persuade them. <br>
JANEWAY: It's worth a try. Brief him. <br>
PARIS: In the meantime, I think we should let the programme play out. <br>
JANEWAY: You're not suggesting we wait until this Chaotica defeats the
aliens? <br>
PARIS: No, no, I'm suggesting that we help the aliens to defeat
Chaotica. They think that he's leading some kind of hostile invasion
force. Once that threat is gone, it's a good bet that they will leave
and close up their portals. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How do you propose to defeat Chaotica? <br>
PARIS: Well, he's been attacking the aliens with his Death Ray. <br>
TUVOK: It's a shame we don't have one. <br>
PARIS: Forget about what it's called, Tuvok. In the world of Captain
Proton, it's the most powerful weapon that there is. And because it's
photonic, it's lethal to these aliens. Now, in Chapter eighteen, Captain
Proton disables this weapon just before Chaotica can use it to destroy
Earth. <br>
JANEWAY: And you think that Proton, namely you of course, could still
do that? <br>
PARIS: Well, we'd have to knock out the Lightning Shield first. <br>
SEVEN: A forcefield. <br>
PARIS: Yeah, now you're catching on. The Destructo Beam on my rocket
ship can disable the Death Ray, but only if someone gets inside the
Fortress of Doom and can shut down the Lightning Shield. <br>
CHAKOTAY: And who's supposed to do that? <br>
PARIS: Arachnia, Queen of the Spider People. <br>
JANEWAY: Charming. <br>
PARIS: Chaotica thinks so. In the story, he's in love with her. He's
been trying to form an alliance since Chapter Three. She's the only one
that he trusts, the only one that can get close enough to disable the
Lightning Shield. Somebody is going to have to take on her character. <br>
JANEWAY: Who'd you have in mind? Oh, no! <br>
PARIS: It's the role of a lifetime. <br>
TUVOK: Captain, need I remind you that we have exhausted all other
possibilities of escaping this layer of subspace. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Until we can eliminate those distortions, we're trapped. <br>

rocket ship and give me the signal to fire. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
You'll have to use Chaotica's broadcast microphone. <br>
JANEWAY: This is how you've been spending your free time? <br>
PARIS: Well, I've been studying how past generations viewed the future.
<br>
JANEWAY: And? <br>
PARIS: Well, it didn't work out quite as black and white as they
imagined. Now, specifications for Arachnia's costume. One more thing.
if you have trouble with Chaotica, or you can't get to the Death Ray,
you can always uncork the pheromones. <br>
JANEWAY: I beg your pardon. <br>
PARIS: Chapter sixteen, Spell of the Spider. Arachnia sends Chaotica a
vial of her irresistible potion. Now, whenever he gets a whiff, he's
under her spell. <br>
JANEWAY: I get the picture. <br>
PARIS: Yeah, well, my point is that these pheromones seem to throw
Chaotica for a loop. Well, it works in Chapter sixteen, anyway. Now,
the vial is sitting on a small pedestal next to the throne. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll keep an eye out. <br>
PARIS: Okay. <br>
JANEWAY: Thanks for the briefing. <br>
PARIS: I'll see you at the Fortress of Doom. And remember, you're the
Queen.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">LONZAK:
Sire. Three more of our space ships have been destroyed. <br>
CHAOTICA: Argh! Full power to the Death Ray. <br>(He uses his broadcast microphone.)<br>CHAOTICA: Citizens of the Fifth
Dimension. Your feeble attacks are nothing but pinpricks to me.
Surrender now and I will be merciful. <br>
LONZAK: We're receiving a transmission. <br>
CHAOTICA: They are surrendering. <br>
LONZAK: No. It's Queen Arachnia. She wishes to cross the drawbridge. <br>
CHAOTICA: What are you waiting for? Show her in. <br>
LONZAK: I present her Royal Highness, Arachnia! <br>(Enter Janeway is a long, slim-fitting dress, hips thrust forward.)<br>
CHAOTICA: Ahh. At last, at last. My Queen. <br>(He kisses her hand.)<br>CHAOTICA:&nbsp; This is an historic
occasion. Kindred souls meet at last. <br>
JANEWAY: It's an honour to be in your presence, Majesty. I've always
admired your clever fiendishness. <br>
CHAOTICA: Ah, your taste is exceeded only by your beauty. <br>
JANEWAY: This must be your Death Ray. <br>
CHAOTICA: That, my dear, is the Cradle of Persuasion. It's fully
equipped. Brain probe, pain modulator. <br>
JANEWAY: Impressive. It's good you have the Lightning Shield to protect
your equipment. <br>
CHAOTICA: Yes. As long as it's electrified, I am invincible. But my
greatest achievement is there. Behold, the Death Ray. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, it looks like a formidable weapon. <br>
CHAOTICA: The most powerful in the cosmos. There is so much more I want
to show you. My throne, for example. The seat of my Empire. <br>
JANEWAY: Ah. I see you've kept my pheromones. I didn't realise you were the
sentimental type. <br>
CHAOTICA: Your perfume inspires me. <br>(She tucks the vial into her sleeve.)<br>
JANEWAY: Would you mind? <br>
CHAOTICA: Oh, please. <br>(Janeway sits on the throne.)<br>
JANEWAY: Somehow I feel comfortable here. <br>
CHAOTICA: Join me and you will have your own chair. One adorned with
the most precious jewels and the softest silk. <br>
JANEWAY: Your Majesty seems overly concerned with romantic matters when
there's a battle to be won. That is why you asked me here. <br>
CHAOTICA: Of course, my dear. Forgive me. It's just that the air itself
seems to vibrate in your presence. <br>
JANEWAY: We can't be slaves to our passion. Not when your Empire is
threatened. I have assembled my fleet of Spider ships. However, the
Lightning Shield prevents them from approaching your fortress. <br>
CHAOTICA: We'll send them directly into battle, alongside my space
force. <br>
JANEWAY: My soldiers wish to pay homage to you. <br>
CHAOTICA: Gratifying. Of course, if I lower the shield my fortress will
be defenceless. Even an ally might choose such a moment to seize my
throne. <br>
JANEWAY: You don't trust me. <br>
CHAOTICA: There is a way you could convince me of your loyalty. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh? <br>
CHAOTICA: I'll lower my Lightning Shield but first, you must become my
Queen! Gather my courtiers! Prepare for the ceremony! <br>
JANEWAY: And don't forget to deactivate the Lightning Shield, so my
subjects may witness the blessed event. <br>
CHAOTICA: Very well. Do as she says, once her guests have arrived. <br>
LONZAK: Yes, Sire. <br>
CHAOTICA: And so, my dear, the day you have always dreamed of has arrived.
The day you become Bride of Chaotica!

ALIEN: Earth? <br>
EMH: A planet some distance from here. I've come on a mission of peace.
<br>
ALIEN: Elaborate. <br>
EMH: Your people and the people of Earth have a common enemy. <br>
ALIEN: Chaotica. <br>
EMH: The one and only. <br>
ALIEN: He threatens to invade our realm, destroy our people. <br>
EMH: Join the club. Chaotica has designs on Earth too. But we've
withstood countless attacks, all thanks to one man. Captain Proton. <br>
ALIEN: Captain Proton? <br>
EMH: Defender of the universe, scourge of intergalactic evil, And a
competent medic to boot, but don't say I said so. Even as we speak,
he's preparing to destroy Chaotica's Death Ray, but he needs your help.
<br>
ALIEN: Explain. <br>
EMH: Your weapons pose a threat to Proton's rocket ship. You must cease
firing while he mounts his attack. Once Chaotica's Death Ray is
destroyed, you can return to your realm confident that you'll never
hear from him again. <br>
ALIEN: Captain Proton may proceed. <br>

CHAOTICA: Why this preoccupation with the Shield? <br>
