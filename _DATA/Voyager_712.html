TUVOK: That disruptor blast had a Klingon signature. <br>
JANEWAY: Evasive manoeuvres. Hail them. <br>
TUVOK: No response. Port shields are down to fifty percent. <br>(We get a glimpse of a vessel usually seen in the Original Series.)<br>
KIM: They've re-cloaked again. Tetryon readings indicate it's a D-Seven
Class cruiser. <br>
PARIS: D-Seven? They were retired decades ago. <br>

Captain Kohlar. Lieutenant Torres, our Chief Engineer. <br>
KOHLAR: You're with child. <br>
TORRES: That's what the Doctor tells me. <br>
KOHLAR: Did you conceive during the holy month of Nay'Poq?<br>
TORRES: I have no idea. <br>
KOHLAR: It would have been fourteen or fifteen weeks ago. <br>
TORRES: That sounds about right, not that it's any of your business. <br>
KOHLAR: I must return to my ship. <br>
TUVOK: Aren't you interested in learning about the Treaty?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Here's a copy of the Khitomer Accords. <br>
KOHLAR: I must return to my vessel. <br>
JANEWAY: Not without your assurance that you won't fire on my ship
again. <br>
KOHLAR: You have my word. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KOHLAR:
It's the truth. <br>
T'GRETH?: How can you be certain? <br>
KOHLAR: The scrolls say, you will find me after two warring houses make
peace. Our people and the Federation, our greatest enem,y are at peace. <br>
T'GRETH: So the humans claim. These Accords may be a deception.<br>
KOHLAR: The other signs are present. You will know me before I know the
world. <br>
MORAK : The child is unborn. It does not know the world. <br>
KOHLAR: You interpret the scrolls well. <br>
T'GRETH: We must verify the evidence. <br>
KOHLAR: Your scepticism darkens my heart, T'Greth. What evidence did
our ancestors have when they began this journey? Nothing but their
faith. Tell the others to prepare. The Day of Separation has arrived. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM:
Captain, the Klingon ship. Its core is breaching. <br>
JANEWAY: Red alert. Hail them. <br>
KOHLAR [on viewscreen]: I salute you, Captain. You did more damage to
our vessel than my engineer thought. <br>
JANEWAY: We can send over a team to help you establish a containment
field. <br>
KOHLAR [on viewscreen]: There isn't time. <br>
KIM: He's right. Their core is going to breach in less than thirty
seconds. <br>
KOHLAR [on viewscreen]: I'm requesting emergency transport. <br>
TUVOK: Captain. Their crew complement is two hundred and four. <br>
JANEWAY: Erect forcefields around the shuttlebay. Transport them
there. Tell your crew to stand by for evacuation. <br>
KIM: Ten seconds. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If we're still too close when their core breaches<br>
JANEWAY: Go to warp as soon as their crew is aboard. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KOHLAR:
You spared us a dishonourable death. <br>
TUVOK: Sensor logs indicate that the containment failure was not caused
by our weapons. <br>
JANEWAY: You activated a self-destruct sequence. <br>
KOHLAR: It was the only way to get us aboard Voyager. <br>
JANEWAY: Why was that so important? <br>
KOHLAR: It's our sacred duty to be here. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't understand. <br>
KOHLAR: More than a hundred years ago, my great-grandfather was part of
a sect which believed the Empire had lost its way. They discovered a
sacred text. It told them to embark on a journey to a distant region of
the galaxy.<br>
JANEWAY: You've been travelling for four generations? <br>
KOHLAR: My people have always known the voyage would be long and
difficult, but the scrolls said we would be rewarded.<br>
JANEWAY: How? <br>
KOHLAR: We would find the Kuvah'Magh, the saviour of our people. The
one who will lead us to a new empire. The scrolls instruct us to follow
her wherever she goes. <br>
JANEWAY: What does any of this have to do with Voyager? <br>
KOHLAR: I believe the Kuvah'Magh is the unborn child of B'Elanna
Torres. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Briefing

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TORRES:
You're joking. <br>
JANEWAY: They take their beliefs very seriously. <br>
PARIS: Seriously enough to destroy their own ship? <br>
KIM: Couldn't they have just followed us? <br>
JANEWAY: Apparently, their sacred text told them to cast off the old
ways as soon as they found this Kuvah'Magh. <br>
TUVOK: They saw their vessel as the last vestige of the corrupt Empire.
<br>
PARIS: I was hoping our daughter would be special, but I never dreamed
she'd turn out to be the Klingon messiah. <br>
TORRES: This isn't funny. They might be dangerous. I mean, what if they
want to hurt the baby? <br>
CHAKOTAY: To them, your baby's sacred. It's unlikely they would do
anything to harm her. <br>
TUVOK: Two hundred Klingons pose a significant security threat. I
suggest we keep them confined to the shuttlebay until we can find a
suitable home for them. <br>
NEELIX: There are women and children down there. We can't just lock
them up.<br>
JANEWAY: I agree. <br>
TUVOK: Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Assign extra security to every deck and make sure the Klingons
know and abide by the rules. <br>
TUVOK: The bridge will have to be off limits. Engineering as well. <br>
JANEWAY: Keep them out of all restricted areas. <br>
TUVOK: Despite their reverence for Lieutenant Torres, she should be
assigned a twenty four hour security detail. <br>
TORRES: Just what I need. <br>
KIM: Where are they going to sleep? <br>
NEELIX: We'll double up in quarters. I'll ask for volunteers. <br>
JANEWAY: I know this isn't going to be easy, but until we can find
another place for them, we should do our best to make them feel
comfortable. Dismissed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">NEELIX:
Captain, you must try the gagh. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll pass, thank you. But I'm glad to see you're getting into
the spirit of things. <br>
NEELIX: Well, I've been studying the Klingon database. They're a
fascinating people, very
robust. And they certainly seem to appreciate my culinary skills. <br>
JANEWAY: Looks like everything's running smoothly. <br>
NEELIX: Ah, not quite everything. some of the Starfleet people have
been complaining about the smell. Personally, I find it appealing. A
kind of a musky aroma. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe we can adjust the environmental controls to filter out
the musk. <br>(A Klingon woman is starting an argument.)<br>
CH'REGA: Thief! Touch my food again and I'll kill you. <br>
KIM: Okay, everybody relax. <br>
CH'REGA: He took gagh from my plate. <br>
NEELIX: If you don't mind, Ensign, I've been studying Klingon
etiquette. You shouldn't quarrel over
food. Save your strength for battle, to fight those who would challenge
you. <br>(Neelix gets thrown to the deck.)<br>
KIM: Take it easy. <br>(Kim manhandles Ch'Rega.) <br>KIM: That's enough! <br>
CH'REGA: You have a fiery spirit. You will make a worthy mate.

What a day. I never met a more ravenous group in my life. I must have
served over three hundred meals. <br>
TUVOK: Mister Neelix, may I ask what you're doing here? <br>
NEELIX: We're bunkmates. <br>
TUVOK: There must be some mistake. <br>
NEELIX: No, there's no mistake. I gave up my quarters to a Klingon
family. By the time I checked with Commander Chakotay, you were the only
one who hadn't been paired up.<br>
TUVOK: You should have consulted me. <br>
NEELIX: We're such close friends, I knew you wouldn't mind. <br>
TUVOK: Mister Neelix, as much as I enjoy your company, I prefer
solitude in my own quarters. <br>
NEELIX: You don't really want me to go back there and tell that family
to get out, do you?
Good. Because I promise you we're going to have fun, Mister Vulcan. I
learned some Klingon drinking songs. I'll teach them to you. (sings)

TORRES: How long do you think they're going to be on board? <br>

you agree to meet with their Council of Elders. <br>

KOHLAR: Yes, but <br>
T'GRETH: Why didn't you tell us? <br>
KOHLAR: It wasn't important. <br>
T'GRETH: Not important? We destroyed our ship because you said she was
the mother of the Kuvah'Magh. <br>
KOHLAR: Show me where it's written that the Kuvah'Magh must have pure
Klingon blood. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Briefing

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TORRES:
My baby's just a baby. She's not a saviour. <br>
KOHLAR: Perhaps you're right. But we must convince my people that she
is. <br>
JANEWAY: Why? <br>
KOHLAR: We've travelled more than thirty thousand light years in search
of this saviour, and in more than one hundred years we've found nothing
except hardship and isolation. When I saw Lieutenant Torres, that she
was with child, I didn't know if I was looking at the mother of the
Kuvah'Magh or not. But I did know I was looking at an opportunity to
end
this wasteful journey. <br>
PARIS: Then you don't believe in the Prophecy? <br>
KOHLAR: What I believe is that my people have suffered enough. If they
accept your child as the Kuvah'Magh you'll hold great influence over
them. We can find a suitable planet. You can tell them it's their new
home and they'll follow you there. <br>
TORRES: I'm not going to lie to them. <br>
KOHLAR: What's the alternative? My people staying aboard your ship
draining your resources? <br>
JANEWAY: I agree with Lieutenant Torres. I'm not comfortable deceiving
your people. <br>
KOHLAR: Perhaps you won't have to lie to them to convince them. <br>
TORRES: What are you suggesting? <br>
KOHLAR: If you study the scrolls with me, we may be able to interpret
them in way that appears consistent with the events of your life. Then
we'll bring those consistencies to the attention of the Council. <br>
PARIS: So you just want to stretch the truth a little. <br>
KOHLAR: It is possible that the sacred scrolls were scrawled by a
madman in a cave. Or perhaps they really were divinely inspired. Either
way, they've guided us for over a century. If my people start to
believe that the sacred scrolls have led them astray, there may be
violence. <br>
JANEWAY: Is that a threat? <br>
KOHLAR: Merely a fact. You're doing everything you can to get your
people home, Captain. That's all I'm doing for mine. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TORRES:
It says the Kuvah'Magh will be descended from a noble house. I don't
come from one and I'm pretty sure my husband doesn't, either. <br>
KOHLAR: We all have nobility in our blood if we go back far enough. <br>
TORRES: So these scrolls can mean anything you want them to. <br>
KOHLAR: It is written that the mother of the Kuvah'Magh would be an
off-worlder. Weren't you born on a Federation colony? <br>
TORRES: A lot of Klingons are born off-world. <br>
KOHLAR: It also says that you would have lived a life of solitude, and
endured many hardships. That's accurate, isn't it? <br>
TORRES: According to this, I'm supposed to have won a glorious victory
against an army of ten thousand warriors. <br>
KOHLAR: Haven't you? <br>
TORRES: We haven't even encountered ten thousand warriors. Unless you
include the Borg.<br>
KOHLAR: Did you help destroy one of their vessels? <br>
TORRES: I suppose. <br>
KOHLAR: Couldn't that have been your glorious victory? <br>
TORRES: I guess so. <br>
KOHLAR: Where are the images of Kahless? Where is your family crest? <br>
TORRES: They clashed with the carpet. <br>
KOHLAR: Don't you honour any of your people's traditions? <br>
TORRES: Not really. <br>
KOHLAR: There is one tradition we can honour together. <br>
TORRES: What are you doing? <br>
KOHLAR: It's midday. Time to remember the sacrifice of our ancestors.
Haven't you made a plea for the dead before? <br>
TORRES: Not since I was a child. <br>
KOHLAR: The dead can't rest in Sto-Vo-Kor if the living don't honour
their memory. Perhaps there's someone I can honour on your behalf. Who
did you plead for as a child? <br>
TORRES: My grandmother. <br>

fallen in your name. Lift them out of the Cavern of Despair and reveal
yourself to them in all your glory. <br>

That's when they beamed aboard the Flyer, weapons firing. Tuvok and

ten of their fiercest Hunters alone. <br>

TORRES: (underneath conversation) took them down two at a time, but
they kept coming. <br>
NEELIX: Exaggeration is part of Klingon custom. She's doing great. <br>

last Hunter in hand-to-hand combat. It was a glorious fight! <br>

say you are the mother of the Kuvah'Magh, the one who will guide us to
a new homeworld. Has your unborn child told you where it is? <br>
TORRES: The scrolls say, you will follow in my footsteps before I have
made them. Yesterday we changed course toward a planet very much like
Kronos. So in a manner of speaking, you are now following my child to a
new home. <br>
T'GRETH: You deliver the words we want to hear, but it's Kohlar who
gives them to you. Are you his puppet in the bedchamber as well? <br>

that the father of the Kuvah'Magh will be an honourable warrior. Would
an honourable warrior ever refuse a challenge? <br>

JANEWAY: I intend to.&nbsp;Mister Tuvok. <br>(Tuvok escorts Kohlar and
T'Greth.) <br>JANEWAY: Gentlemen, I'm afraid Lieutenant Paris had no authority
to accept this challenge. There will be no death matches aboard my
ship. <br>
T'GRETH: I told you this petaQ was not the true father. <br>
JANEWAY: Lieutenant Paris is perfectly willing to fight you, Mister
T'Greth. I'm the one preventing him from doing so. <br>
T'GRETH: The father of the Kuvah'Magh wouldn't let a woman speak for
him. <br>
KOHLAR: T'Greth, there is precedent for an honourable compromise. A
non-lethal bout, fought with blunted bat'leths. The victory goes to the
first warrior to knock his opponent to the ground three times. <br>
T'GRETH: A coward's rules. <br>
KOHLAR: Was the Emperor Mur'Eq a coward? He was the one who instituted
these rules to insure that his warriors would kill their enemies and
not each other.<br>
JANEWAY: If you agree to these terms I'll allow the match. <br>
T'GRETH: I'll see you on the field of battle. <br>(T'Greth leaves.) <br>
TUVOK: I assume you have a suitable holodeck training programme for
this, Lieutenant? <br>
KOHLAR: He'll be ready. I'll train him myself.

NEELIX: Officer Ch'Rega. <br>

NEELIX: I haven't seen her today. <br>
KIM: She's been following me everywhere. <br>
NEELIX: Why? <br>
KIM: She wants to mate. <br>
NEELIX: Oh! You're a lucky man. She's a fine specimen of Klingon
womanhood. <br>
KIM: I guess it's a matter of taste. <br>(Ch'Rega appears. Kim heads for the Jefferies tube.) <br>KIM: You never saw
me. <br>
NEELIX: Wait, I have a better idea. <br>(Neelix pushes Kim against the wall.) <br>
KIM: Neelix, what the hell are you doing?<br>
NEELIX: Play along. I'm taking her off your hands. When I say you're
limited to two servings of brak't, that's all you get. Do you
understand me, Ensign? <br>
KIM: Yes, sir. Whatever you say. <br>
NEELIX: I don't think you do. If I catch you eating more than your
share again, I'll cut it out of your belly. (sotto) Run. <br>(Kim runs, bumping into crewmen.)<br>

EMH: I don't. I'm here in an official capacity. <br>
NEELIX: Well, you do know they're fighting with non-lethal weapons? <br>
EMH: You'd be surprised how much damage a blunt bat'leth can do. <br>
KOHLAR: Warriors, assemble! <br>(Paris is in Klingon armour. Torres hands him his bat'leth.)<br>
TORRES: Today would be a very bad day to die. <br>
PARIS: I'll try to remember that. <br>
KOHLAR: Let honour guide you. Tagh. <br>(Paris and T'Greth circle each other.)<br>
T'GRETH: I see fear in your eyes, human. <br>
PARIS: The only Klingon I'm afraid of is my wife after she's worked a
double shift. <br>
(They fight. T'Greth disarms Paris at one point, but he scrambles to
retrieve &nbsp;his weapon. They clash blades and Paris dodges the
slashes until T'Greth collapses, breathless. The EMH goes to treat the
fallen warrior.)<br>
KOHLAR: It's begun. <br>
EMH: What are you talking about? <br>
KOHLAR: He's dying. <br>
EMH: Typically, I'm the one to make that kind of prognosis. <br>
KOHLAR: It's the nehret. It kills all of us who aren't fortunate enough
to die in battle. </font></p>

It's a retrovirus that destroys the cells by attacking the cytoplasmic
membranes. <br>
JANEWAY: Shouldn't our bio-filters have detected it when we transported
the Klingons aboard?<br>
EMH: This is an insidious virus. It lies dormant, disguising itself as
inert genetic material until it inexplicably activates. <br>
KOHLAR: The nehret always comes without warning. <br>
EMH: I've reviewed my scans of the other Klingons. They're all
carriers. <br>
JANEWAY: Why didn't you tell us your people had a disease? <br>
KOHLAR: We've never thought of it as a disease. It's more like old age.<br>
JANEWAY: Is it contagious? <br>
EMH: Only to Klingons. If you'd give us some privacy, I'd like to
examine Lieutenant Torres. <br>
JANEWAY: Of course. <br>(Janeway and Kohlar leave. The EMH does the scan.) <br>
TORRES: The baby too? <br>
EMH: I'm afraid so. <br>

will fall victim to it as well. <br>
MORAK: Impossible. <br>
T'GRETH: They both carry it. She told me herself. <br>
MORAK: But the scrolls say the Kuvah'Magh is younger than old age. <br>
T'GRETH: And stronger than sickness. She cannot be our saviour. We
should resume our search. <br>
MORAK: Kohlar and many of the others won't agree. <br>

all that different. <br>

time. <br>
