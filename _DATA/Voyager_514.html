the aliens. <br>

EMH: Yes, Commander. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm tired. I want to sleep. <br>
EMH: If you lose consciousness, it could sever your link with the
aliens. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Aliens? <br>
EMH: The ones who live in this place. We're trapped here. They may know
a way out. It's urgent that you speak with them. <br>
CHAKOTAY: But I don't understand what they're saying. <br>
EMH: I can try to help you understand. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm going to end up like my grandfather. A crazy old man. <br>
EMH: No, you're not crazy. I believe the aliens are reconfiguring your
neural pathways so they can communicate with you. Do you remember the
day you were injured on the holodeck? <br>
CHAKOTAY: In the boxing simulation? <br>
EMH: Yes. You were knocked down, remember? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I was injured. I came to see you. We had an argument. <br>
EMH: That's right. Try to remember more about the holodeck. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I was sparring with a Terrellian, and Boothby was there. He
used to train me when I was a cadet. <br>
EMH: Keep going. What round was it? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Three. Round three. The fight was going badly. I was avoiding
my opponent.

Stay away from the ropes, son. That's it, that's it. <br>

CHAKOTAY: That wasn't so bad. <br>
BOOTHBY: It was terrible. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Am I missing something? He barely landed a glove on me. <br>
BOOTHBY: Give him time. You're not reading him. You think he's slow and
stupid. I know better. In fact, I know his kind in my bones. Literally.
I can count the fractures, if you'd like. <br>
CHAKOTAY: He's not landing any punches. <br>
BOOTHBY: That's the problem. You're not letting him. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Have I got this sport all wrong? <br>
BOOTHBY: Boxing is more about taking the shots than dishing them out.
You shouldn't be dancing away from this fellow. Let him punch himself
out a little. It all comes down to the heart. Do you have the heart for
this? That's the contest. It's not against him. It's against your own
natural human desire not to get hurt. That's the real fight. <br>
COMPUTER: Begin round four. <br>
BOOTHBY: Go. Go, go, go. <br>(Chakotay and the Terrellian trade punches properly.)<br>BOOTHBY: Stay with him. Too close. Come on, come on,
break it up. Atta boy. Keep him busy. <br>(Chakotay sees the holodeck coming apart behind his opponent.)<br>BOOTHBY: Gloves up!<br>(The Terrellian knocks Chakotay out.)

many? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Three. <br>
EMH: Good guess. I've got a good mind to use a needle and thread. Add a
little authenticity to your fun. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Be my guest <br>
EMH: You'd like that. A manly scar above your eye. Chakotay, the Maquis
Mauler. Pointless violence. That programme shouldn't even be in our
database. <br>
CHAKOTAY: There's nothing like a good fight, Doctor. I was there when
Pryce-Jones went twenty three rounds with Gul Tulet. The Knockout in
the Neutral Zone. Best match I ever saw. <br>
EMH: Really? Most blood spilled, or did Pryce-Jones drive Gul Tulet's
nasal bone up into his brain? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You've got the wrong idea. <br>
EMH: The idea is simple enough. Do enough damage to your opponent to
render him unconscious. How's the headache? <br>
CHAKOTAY: It hurts. <br>
EMH: Oedema beneath the anterior fossa of the cranium. Hairline
fracture of the septum. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I saw something strange. <br>
EMH: I'll bet you did. <br>
CHAKOTAY: No, before I got hit. <br>
EMH: What do you mean? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I looked over at Boothby. He yelled at me. I turned back,
then the ring got distorted. <br>
EMH: An hallucination. You probably had some pressure building up along
the optic nerves from a previous blow. <br>
CHAKOTAY: No, I was keeping away from him the whole fight. He never
touched me. <br>
EMH: Hmm. A number of the ganglia in your visual cortex are
hyperactive. Your opponent wasn't firing on you with an energy weapon,
was he? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Just his gloves. <br>(Whumph!)<br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Chakotay to the bridge. <br>
CHAKOTAY: On my way. <br>
EMH: I want you back in here for some tests, unless you want to be
seeing things on a regular basis.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">KIM:
It's changed course again. Twenty thousand kilometres off starboard. <br>(Chakotay has changed into his uniform before reporting for duty.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Ion storm? <br>
JANEWAY: Not exactly. It's two light years across, emits enough energy
for a dozen stars, it doesn't match any phenomenon in our database, and
it won't sit still. <br>
KIM: Okay, eleven thousand kilometres off the port bow. <br>
TUVOK: We are too close. <br>
PARIS: I'm backing us off. <br>
TUVOK: The phenomenon has been shifting positions every few minutes. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Nothing so massive could move that fast. <br>
JANEWAY: Full reverse. Maximum shields. <br>(Voyager is engulfed by wibbly space.)<br>JANEWAY: </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Full stop. </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Anybody want to tell
me where we are? <br>
TUVOK: We appear to be inside the disturbance. <br>
KIM: I'm picking up a lot of raw data. Subspace flux, graviton waves.
Sensors must be confused. The readings are shifting around so much I
can't make heads or tails of what's out there. <br>
SEVEN [OC]: Captain, this is Seven of Nine. Please report to
Astrometrics at once.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Astrometrics
lab]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">SEVEN:
The Borg have been aware of this phenomenon for many years. It is a
zone where the law of physics are in a state of flux. Chaotic
space.&nbsp;<br>
JANEWAY: Why didn't sensors warn us in time? <br>
SEVEN: Chaotic space appears randomly and unexpectedly. The Borg have
observed it throughout the galaxy. <br>
TUVOK: Then why hasn't a Federation starship encountered anything like
this? <br>
SEVEN: No doubt some have. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Think of all the Starfleet vessels that disappeared under
mysterious circumstances. <br>
SEVEN: Borg vessels are more advanced, but only one Cube has survived an
encounter with Chaotic space. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Those aren't good odds. <br>
TUVOK: If the physical constants are shifting, our sensors can't
function. <br>
SEVEN: The problem is here. Changes in the gravitational coefficient
will cause sudden shear forces against our hull. Shields will protect
us, but only for a time. <br>
JANEWAY: How much time? <br>
SEVEN: Unknown. <br>
JANEWAY: We've got to recalibrate the sensors, redesign them if
necessary, otherwise we're flying blind. Let's get to work.

Graviton wave displacement says we're moving at warp six. Subspace
sensors show we're standing still. <br>
PARIS: We can't be that far from where we entered. Maybe we should just
set a course, go to impulse and see what happens. <br>
TUVOK: What would most likely happen is a collision with an asteroid
field or a star. <br>
PARIS: That'd be better than just sitting here waiting for. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The EMH's singing voice is going up in octaves.) <br>EMH:
Laaaa. Laaaa. Lets go to eight hundred eighty hertz. Laaaa. <br>
JANEWAY: Music lessons? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Pretty soon we'll be singing duets. <br>
EMH: I'm checking to see if there's been any damage to the auditory
nerves. Nothing so far. His vision checks out as well. I'm afraid the source of the
trouble may be a little deeper. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The family curse. <br>
JANEWAY: What do you mean? <br>
EMH: Chakotay has the genetic marker for a cognitive disorder. Sensory
tremens. The primary symptoms are visual and auditory hallucinations. <br>
CHAKOTAY: My family doctor suppressed the gene before I was even born,
so I never had to go through what the others did, like my grandfather. <br>
EMH: For some reason, the gene's been switched on. I'm not saying for
certain that's why Chakotay thought he was getting ready for a
prize-fight, but it's a good bet. The holodeck boxing simulation was
fresh in his memory. A few misfiring neurons did the rest. <br>
JANEWAY: This Chaotic space we've entered, could it be stimulating the
gene? <br>
EMH: Possibly. The only way to make certain would be to get the ship
out of here. In the meantime, the Commander will have to stay in
Sickbay. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok tells me you've got a mean left jab. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Never spar with a Vulcan. <br>
JANEWAY: How are you doing? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm all right. When I was a boy, my grandfather started
seeing things nobody else could see, hearing what nobody else could
hear. He refused treatment. A couple of hyposprays a day, that's all he would have needed, but
he was stubborn. He said his spirit was in pain, but that the wound must
be honoured. Crazy old man.

JANEWAY: Janeway to Seven. Bring the grid back online. <br>
SEVEN [OC]: Stand by. <br>
KIM: We've got sensors. Scanning to one hundred thousand kilometres,
seven hundred thousand. <br>
TUVOK: Sensors are stable to one million kilometres. We won't be able
to scan any further. <br>
JANEWAY: Are you picking up anything at that range? <br>
KIM: No planets, no asteroid fields, no sink holes. <br>
PARIS: Good enough for me. <br>
JANEWAY: Set a course dead ahead, one quarter impulse. Sensor status? <br>
TUVOK: Continuing to function. <br>
KIM: Still nothing ahead. <br>
JANEWAY: Good. Let's increase our speed. Mister Paris, go to half
impulse. <br>
KIM: Wait! It's a ship. <br>
TUVOK: Warp capable. It's adrift and the outer hull is damaged. <br>
KIM: No lifesigns. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The other ship is visible through the windows.)<br>JANEWAY:
Computer, let's hear that again. <br>
ALIEN [OC]: Why won't you answer? Did you give up on me for being so
late? It's not my fault. We got lost in here. Why do the stars make such a
noise? Let me sleep! I don't understand them, I don't want to talk to
them. I just want to go home. <br>
TUVOK: That was the final distress call. <br>
EMH: According to the vessel's medical records, the Captain and one of
his engineers started hallucinating after they entered this space. The
physician on board never found a way to treat them. <br>
JANEWAY: How long were they stranded here? <br>
KIM: Almost a year. Eventually their systems were compromised. <br>
EMH: They died of exposure. <br>
KIM: The sensors in that ship are more advanced than ours, and they
couldn't find a way out. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's hold our position until we get a better idea of what
we're up against. <br>
TORRES: It looks like that's what they did. <br>
PARIS: Along the way, a couple of them started sounding just like
Chakotay. <br>
EMH: I can't believe that's a coincidence. <br>
TUVOK: Then why hasn't anyone else been affected? <br>
EMH: That's a question I can't answer. Not yet. Request permission to
beam their captain's body on board. I'd like to perform an autopsy. <br>
JANEWAY: Granted. Pull the sensor technology off that ship. Use it to
enhance ours. We're going to need all the help we can get. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH: I
made a deep scan of the alien's brain tissue and sensory organs. The
optic and auditory neurons have been partially stripped of their normal
protein insulation. The result, auditory and visual hallucinations. <br>
JANEWAY: The same symptoms as Chakotay, but a different cause. <br>
EMH: Exactly. In this case the gene responsible for producing protein
insulation was shut down. <br>
CHAKOTAY: By what? <br>
EMH: There might be something in Chaotic space that reacts with DNA,
alters it. But why it targeted him specifically and now you I can't
say. <br>
JANEWAY: Is there a treatment? <br>
EMH: I can control the hallucinations using a neural suppressant, but
unless I can find a way to deactivate that gene of yours<br>
CHAKOTAY: I need to go on a vision quest. Captain? <br>
EMH: That's not the best idea right now. A vision quest taps directly
into your frontal cortex. It could agitate your mind. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Or help me control it. <br>
JANEWAY: Permission granted. <br>
EMH: Very well. I will ask you to wear a cortical monitor. It'll help
me keep track of your vital signs. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Could be some sort of alien geometry, but we'll need much
more. Is it safe for him to try to make contact again? <br>

of that. <br>(Janeway goes to Chakotay's biobed.)<br>
JANEWAY: I realise you're frightened, but you're our only hope out of
this place. You think this could risk your sanity, but your sanity
won't do you any good if we remain in Chaotic space. I need you to keep
trying, Chakotay. Will you keep trying? (he nods.) Keep me posted. <br>

me what they're saying. <br>

receptive frame of mind. Think back to when you first heard them in the

hard shot to the head and neck collapses the carotid artery and cuts
the flow of blood to the brain. The hook. The head and neck twist
laterally, traumatising the cerebral tissue. And who can forget the
upper cut? The head snaps back, rupturing tissue in the cerebellum and
upper spinal cord. Yes! And the result of all this poetry in motion?
Neurologic dysfunction, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, loss of
balance and coordination, loss of memory. Starting to sound familiar? <br>
NEELIX: Chakotay's fine. He just needs a little conditioning, that's
all. <br>
EMH: He needs to listen to his doctor and not to his fantasies. Step

JANEWAY: Tell me about him. What does he look like? <br>
CHAKOTAY: He's got a couple of kilos on me, a few centimetres in height,
but I can take him, Captain. I just have to stay off the ropes. <br>
EMH: The Holodeck boxing simulation is still strong in his memory.
Obviously, it's the primary source of imagery for his hallucinations. <br>
JANEWAY: What if those hallucinations are being induced for a purpose?
Aliens who exist on some perceptual wavelength that our senses can't
detect, and the only way for them to communicate with us is to alter
our senses. Chakotay's bad gene gave them the opportunity. <br>
EMH: What are you proposing? <br>
JANEWAY: Remember the derelict ship? Two of their crewmembers claimed
they were seeing things. Was somebody trying to communicate with them?
Was somebody trying to warn them, help them? <br>
