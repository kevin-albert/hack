QUARK: The usual, Odo? <br>
ODO: Nothing. <br>
QUARK: The usual. If all my customers were like you, my family would be
begging on the Promenade. <br>
ODO: Oh, I seriously doubt that. Not as long as there's a Miradorn
raider for you to do business with. <br>
QUARK: Raider? You mean the Miradorn ship that just docked? <br>
ODO: The raider. <br>
QUARK: It's reputation, like mine, has probably been exaggerated.
Anyway, I don't know the ship or its crew. <br>
ODO: You didn't make your usual welcome call inviting them in for a
free drink? <br>
QUARK: The Miradorns are a quarrelsome people. I chose to forego the
usual amenities. <br>
ODO: He looks away whenever we make eye contact. <br>
QUARK: Who? <br>
ODO: The new arrival. The one the Klingons brought back from the Gamma
Quadrant. <br>
QUARK: Croden? He's harmless. <br>
ODO: Really. How is it you've come to know him so well? <br>
QUARK: A man comes in for a drink, he wants to talk <br>
ODO: He didn't seem to want to talk much to Sisko when he arrived. <br>
QUARK: Who would? All those Starfleet officers greeting him at the
airlock. It would scare me too. The Federation could learn a few things
from the Ferengi about hospitality. <br>
ODO: They scared him, huh? <br>
QUARK: Of course. <br>
ODO: I wonder what he has to be scared about. <br>
(two big Miradorns enter and go up to the holosuites) <br>
ODO: Well, now. I believe a pair of twinned Miradorn just nodded your
way. <br>
QUARK: I'm the man behind the bar. Obviously, they want to use a
holosuite. You think the whole galaxy is plotting around you, don't
you. Paranoia must run in your species, Odo. Maybe that's why no one
has ever seen another shape-shifter. They're all hiding. I won't have
you come in here harassing my customers. Order a drink, play the
tables, or vacate the premises. (sotto) Rom, bring a flask of my
special langour. <br>

then goes to get a bottle. When he returns, the tray has five glasses
on it.)

QUARK: Very nice. Unfortunately, there's a problem. <br>
RO-KEL: Problem? <br>
ROM: Langour, anyone? <br>
AH-KEL: What problem? <br>
QUARK: The buyer has backed out. <br>
RO-KEL: You guaranteed us a buyer. <br>
QUARK: A question has been raised about the origin of this bauble. A
similar one was taken during a raid on a Vanoben transport just two
light years from here. If you had a bill of sale <br>
RO-KEL: You didn't ask for any bill of sale when we contacted you. You
will find another buyer. <br>
QUARK: A buyer who asks no questions? That could take a long time. <br>
AH-KEL: We don't have a long time. <br>
(Croden enters, with a weapon) <br>
CRODEN: Just stay, stay, stay where you are, please.&nbsp;<br>
RO-KEL: What's this? <br>
QUARK: Don't fire. What do you want? <br>
CRODEN: No one is going to get hurt. Just give me that. <br>
AH-KEL: Whoever you are, you're making a mistake. <br>
CRODEN: Well, it wouldn't be the first, and probably won't be the last.
Give that to me. <br>
(Ah-Kel grabs the table and smashes it into Croden's face. The broken
glass reforms into Odo as Ro-Kel fires but misses Croden. Croden shoots
Ro-Kel and Odo grabs him as he finishes morphing) <br>
ODO: Security and medical to holosuite one. <br>
QUARK: Five glasses for four people? <br>
AH-KEL: He's dead. My brother. <br>
(Odo knocks Ah-Kel down then security arrives) <br>
ODO: Take them all to Security. <br>
QUARK: Yes, take them both to his office. Thank goodness you were close
by, Odo <br>
ODO: All of them. Get out. Go on. <br>

SISKO: I haven't met any before now. <br>
AH-KEL: In my species, we are not just twin brothers. Together we are a

ODO: You should have considered the risks before trying to sell stolen
property. <br>
AH-KEL: You have no proof <br>
ODO: Two people were killed on the transport this object was taken
from. <br>
AH-KEL: My brother and I purchased it from a passing Altoran trader. <br>
ODO: His name? His ship's identification? <br>
AH-KEL: I am the one whose brother was killed, Commander. <br>
ODO: You have only yourself <br>
SISKO: I'd like you to return to your ship now. You have my sympathies,

SISKO: The law will deal with him. <br>
AH-KEL: My only purpose in life from here on is to see him dead. <br>

QUARK: Well, can't say I didn't warn you about Miradorns, Odo. I assume
we are free to go? <br>
SISKO: Do you have enough evidence to hold them, Constable? <br>
QUARK: As Odo will be happy to confirm, I was just as concerned as
everyone else that this was a stolen objet d'art. <br>
ODO: Yes. Curious, but it's true. <br>
QUARK: We'll be on our way then. <br>
ODO: You know what else is curious? It's curious that Croden had a
Ferengi phaser. <br>
QUARK: Available in many a port. <br>
ODO: And it's curious that he knew the Miradorn were trying to sell you
something of value. <br>
ROM: How dare you suggest that my brother set up this robbery! <br>
ODO: What an interesting theory, Rom. <br>
QUARK: If that theory should ever reach the Miradorn, I'd wake up dead
one morning. So, I'd appreciate your not spreading wild theories around
casually. <br>

ODO: The fact that you just killed a man doesn't affect your appetite? <br>
CRODEN: It was him or me. And if he'd have killed me, I wouldn't be
hungry now. <br>
SISKO: I want to be sure you understand exactly what's going to happen.
There will be a trial to determine your guilt or innocence. We can
assign an advocate or you can request one from your home world. <br>
CRODEN: I doubt that anyone on Rakhar would much care. <br>
SISKO: Really. Isn't murder considered a serious crime where you come
from? <br>
CRODEN: On Rakhar, all crimes are serious, only there are no trials. <br>
SISKO: It's a shame that our first encounter with your species had to
take place under these circumstances. <br>
CRODEN: I'm sorry if I made things awkward. I didn't have much choice. <br>
SISKO: Why not? <br>
CRODEN: My needs exceed my skills. Now, if I had his talents, I would
have no problems at all. I've never heard of a changeling with such
versatility. <br>
ODO: A what? <br>
CRODEN: A changeling, like you. <br>
ODO: You've heard of other shape-shifters in the Gamma Quadrant? <br>
CRODEN: Haven't they come through the wormhole yet? I assumed when I
saw you <br>
ODO: It's a lie. He heard me talking in the bar to Quark. <br>
CRODEN: Well, maybe I dissemble a little. Lie is a hard word. But
shape-shifters are harsh in their judgements. Feed me, and maybe I'll
tell you where I met someone just like you. </font></p>

to contact his planet. <br>
O'BRIEN: Not the best way of introducing ourselves. <br>
BASHIR: Homicide as a means to open relations, it's not exactly how
they teach it at the academy, is it. <br>
KIRA: I think you're all wrong. <br>
SISKO: How's that? <br>
KIRA: They're going to thank us. <br>
SISKO: Thank us? <br>
KIRA: That's what I'd do. He's probably committed all sorts of crimes
in their system. They'll be glad to have the problem taken off their
hands. <br>
SISKO: There's only way to find out. Dax? <br>
DAX: It won't be hard to find Rakhar. According to the logs, Croden was
found in a damaged shuttlecraft about three light years from the
wormhole. There aren't many M class planets in that area. <br>
SISKO: You're with me. Major Kira, as long as the Miradorn ship is
here, there's a threat to Croden. I don't want to have to tell his
people that he was killed while in our custody. <br>

ODO: I couldn't get that lucky. That Croden is an interesting
character. <br>
QUARK: I wouldn't know. <br>
ODO: Really? I thought you said you got to know him rather well. <br>
QUARK: I never told you that. I merely said we chatted when he bought a
drink or two. <br>
ODO: I've talked to several people who saw the two of you engaged in
heavy conversations. Why, Morn here says you even bought the fellow a
meal. <br>
QUARK: Morn should keep his big mouth shut! <br>
ODO: So what were you talking to him about? <br>
QUARK: Just being friendly. He was so out of place here, alone. I felt
sorry for him. You should sympathise with my kindness. <br>
ODO: There's no profit in kindness. <br>
QUARK: You attribute odious motives to my every charitable act. <br>
ODO: That's because your favorite charity is your own pocket. Speaking
of odious motives, I hear you've been making inquiries about finding a
small ship to go through the wormhole. <br>
QUARK: That had nothing to do with any of this. <br>
ODO: I think it does. I think you were trying to secure passage back to
the Gamma Quadrant for Croden in exchange for staging this tragic
little robbery of yours. <br>
QUARK: This could turn into a much bigger tragedy for me if you don't
keep your voice down. <br>
ODO: What did Croden tell you about himself? <br>
QUARK: Nothing. We didn't talk about anything except business.
Inconsequential things. <br>
ODO: What's inconsequential to you may be important to me. Did he say
anything about his home world? <br>

deal in common, changeling. <br>
ODO: We have nothing in common. <br>
CRODEN: We are both aliens here, the only ones of our kind. Each of us
is alone, isolated, shut out. Others like us only exist in the Gamma
Quadrant. I have always wondered why changelings are so distrustful of
other species. <br>
ODO: I doubt the changelings on your world would trust you. <br>
CRODEN: Of course not. There are no shape-shifters on Rakhar. <br>
ODO: You just said. You implied there were. <br>
CRODEN: I'm sorry if I misled you. There were shape-shifters on Rakhar
at one time, but that was centuries ago. <br>
ODO: What happened to them? <br>
CRODEN: They were persecuted. Driven out. But I know a place where
there are still some left. Of course, that was a few years ago. <br>
ODO: And if you had the chance, you'd take me there. <br>
CRODEN: Sure I would. Why not? <br>

you. <br>

I don't know. They broke into my home just before dawn, and before I
had time to stop them, they had murdered both my wives. You see, on my
world, the punishment for being an enemy of the people is the death of
your family. I had no sophisticated weapon. Only a short, slaughter
knife that I used for cutting the necks of fowl we would prepare for
supper. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that the necks of the

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRODEN: You'd save time going through the Vortex.
It's a long way around it. Aren't you the least bit curious about your
own people? <br>
ODO: Of course I am. Unfortunately, I don't have the liberty of
pursuing that curiosity right now. <br>
CRODEN: They don't maintain a humanoid shape, you know. They refused to
assimilate on my world. They're a proud species. That's why they were
so persecuted. But I will say this for them, they treated me well
enough when I landed at their colony. I was badly wounded. They could
have allowed me to die. They didn't. You're one of them, that's for
sure. You have the sense of decency, of justice. <br>
ODO: You don't give up, do you. <br>
(Boom, shake) <br>
ODO: Computer, what was that? <br>
COMPUTER: A temporary loss of stability resulting from the impact of a
concentrated plasma charge. <br>
ODO: We're being attacked? <br>
COMPUTER: Affirmative. Pursuing vessel approaching from one eight one
mark one two. <br>
ODO: Put it on the monitor and identify. <br>
COMPUTER: Miradorn vessel, Theta class. <br>
ODO: He's hailing us. <br>
AH-KEL [on monitor]: The first shot was a warning. You will surrender
the Rakhari prisoner to me. <br>
ODO: I don't give up my prisoners, Ah-Kel. <br>
AH-KEL [on monitor]: Very well. Then you can die with him. <br>
(BOOM) <br>
COMPUTER: Warning. Damage to shields <br>
ODO: Computer, evasive manoeuvres! <br>
COMPUTER: Warning. Shields at forty one percent. <br>
CRODEN: Your computer's not going to outsmart him. <br>
ODO: I'm a security chief, not a combat pilot. <br>
CRODEN: Then give me the controls! <br>
ODO: You? <br>
CRODEN: I can get us through the vortex. The ionised gasses would
screen us from his sensors. Drop your suspicious nature for a minute,
changeling. Can't you see it's our only chance. <br>
(Odo unfastens Croden's handcuffs and they head into the purple gases) <br>
ODO: Why are we slowing down? <br>
CRODEN: The vortex is riddled with volatile pockets of a gas we call
toh-maire. If we destabilise them, they could ignite and blow this ship
apart. <br>
ODO: You really have been through here before. <br>
CRODEN: Sometimes I do tell the truth. <br>
ODO: How do you remember what's true and what isn't? (BOOM) I thought
you said they couldn't detect us in here. <br>
CRODEN: He must be following our impulse wake. Computer, disengage
impulse engines. Go to thrusters. <br>
COMPUTER: Acknowledged. Thrusters engaged. <br>
ODO: What are you doing? <br>
CRODEN: Once our impulse wake drops off, he might try to pick up the
discharge of our thrusters. We'll be better off if we land. So,
changeling, I guess I'm going to take you home after all. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Cave tunnel]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(They've landed on the only flat bit of a craggy
asteroid, right next to a cave entrance.) <br>
CRODEN: Hurry. This way. <br>
ODO: Croden! Slow down, Croden. Stay where I can see you. Croden!
What's your hurry? What's in here? <br>
CRODEN: I told you. The colony. <br>
ODO: Anxious to see them again, are you? <br>
CRODEN: Yes. Of course. <br>
ODO: Whatever it is you came here for, you can forget it. We're
leaving. <br>
CRODEN: No! <br>
ODO: Now! How much of it was true? Any of it? Any of it? <br>
CRODEN: No. No. On Rakhar, we tell stories about changelings. I thought
they were myths until I met you. <br>
ODO: The stone. <br>
CRODEN: I have no idea where it came from. Rakhari merchants buy stones
just like it from off-world traders. It's used as a key. <br>
ODO: A key to what? <br>
CRODEN: To my only reason for living. And it's ahead, in that cavern
there.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Cavern]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(There is a large box with rocks fallen onto it) <br>
CRODEN: Please, help me. There's been a cave-in. <br>
ODO: What is it? <br>
CRODEN: A stasis chamber. <br>
(He brushes off the dust to reveal that little girl is inside) <br>
CRODEN: It's my daughter, the only member of my family I could save.
Help me. <br>
(They push a big rock off the top then Croden opens his locket) <br>
CRODEN: It shapes itself to fit the lock. <br>
(They open up the box and the girl wakes up.) <br>
YARETH: Father? I was dreaming about you. <br>
CRODEN: I'm here now, Yareth. You don't have to dream anymore. <br>
YARETH: Hello. <br>
CRODEN: This is Odo. He's a security officer. No, no, he's not going to
hurt you. He's going to take you to a place where you'll be safe. Won't
you? <br>
(Odo nods) <br>
YARETH: Where are you going? <br>
CRODEN: I'm going home. <br>
YARETH: But you can't. They'll kill you. <br>
CRODEN: Yareth, I must answer for my crimes. <br>
YARETH: But all you did was try to protect us. <br>
(Boom) <br>
ODO: Their sensors must have picked up our life signs. We've got to get
back to the runabout. <br>
(A rock falls from the roof onto Odo, knocking him out) <br>
CRODEN: Odo! <br>
YARETH: Is he badly hurt? <br>
CRODEN: There's no way to tell. I don't know anything about his
species. I'll carry him back to the ship. <br>
(But Croden hesitates and starts to leave instead) <br>
YARETH: What's the matter, father? <br>
CRODEN: Nothing, Yareth. Nothing. <br>
(Croden picks up Odo) <br>
CRODEN: Nothing. Go! Go!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Runabout Ganges]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Odo wakes up when they're in flight) <br>
CRODEN: You're heavier than you look. <br>
ODO: You could have left me behind. <br>
CRODEN: Don't thank me. I already regret it. <br>
(Bang) <br>
CRODEN: I haven't been able to lose them. Sooner or later, one of his
photons is going to trigger a toh-maire explosion and kill us all. <br>
ODO: Let me have the controls. Find us one of those toh-maire fields. <br>
CRODEN: I just told you, you don't want to go anywhere near one,
changeling. <br>
ODO: Find the closest toh-maire field. <br>
CRODEN: Six degrees to starboard. <br>
ODO: Changing course. He's chased us everywhere else, maybe he'll
follow us in there too. <br>
CRODEN: His sensors may not be able to detect how volatile the field
is. If he fires on us in there, the whole thing will ignite. <br>
ODO: That's what I'm counting on. <br>
ODO: Set a course along the interior perimeter. <br>
CRODEN: Done. <br>
ODO: Computer, shut down all engines. <br>
COMPUTER: Engines disengaged. <br>
ODO: Maintain emergency readiness to re-engage impulse on my command. <br>
CRODEN: We're an awfully easy target. <br>
(The Miradorn ship overshadows them) <br>
CRODEN: He's hailing us. <br>
ODO: On screen. <br>
AH-KEL [on monitor]: Are you prepared to surrender your prisoner? <br>
ODO: I have a full array of Starfleet weapons trained on you, Ah-Kel.
Frankly, I don't know much about them but I understand they equip this
little vessel with some pretty powerful stuff. So I suggest you
withdraw while you still can <br>
AH-KEL [on monitor]: There will barely be a trace of your little vessel
when we are finished with you. <br>
CRODEN: He's coming about. Powering his shields. His starboard photon
bank is armed. <br>
ODO: Computer, engage. <br>
CRODEN: He's firing photons! <br>
(KaBOOM!) <br>
ODO: Is everybody back there in one piece? <br>
YARETH: Yes. <br>
ODO: Good. Take us out of your precious vortex. <br>
CRODEN: I only have one last favour to ask. Yareth is going to be alone
on your world, just as you've always been. She's going to need someone
to look after her. <br>
ODO: If you're asking me what I think you're asking. <br>
CRODEN: You know you could use some company, changeling. You deny it,
but we both know it's true, or the stone would have meant nothing to
you. <br>
COMPUTER: Incoming subspace signal. Vulcan band frequency. <br>
ODO: On screen. <br>
VULCAN [on monitor]: (a woman) Starfleet runabout, this is the Vulcan
Science Vessel T'Vran. Are you in any difficulty? <br>
ODO: Chief of Security Odo from DS Nine. We're fine, Captain. <br>
VULCAN [on monitor]: We detected a major eruption in the Chamra vortex.
I was afraid a small ship like yours might have suffered damage. <br>
ODO: I appreciate your concern. What's your course? <br>
VULCAN [on monitor]: To the wormhole, then home to Vulcan. <br>
ODO: I've beamed over two survivors from a ship that wasn't so lucky. I
have to complete a mission. Could you give them transportation to
Vulcan? <br>
VULCAN [on monitor]: Easily done. We will rendezvous with you shortly.
Prepare for transport. <br>
(transmission ends) <br>
ODO: Don't thank me. I already regret it. <br>
CRODEN: How? How will you explain not delivering me? <br>
ODO: I'll tell them you were killed when Ah-Kel torpedoed the asteroid.
This dissembling must be catching. You're going to have to get used to
living in an alien society. <br>
CRODEN: Like you. But I know where my home is. And perhaps someday I'll
be able to go back there. I hope this helps you to find where you came
from. <br>
(Croden puts the locket around Odo's neck.) <br>
VULCAN [OC]: T'Vran to Ganges. Ready for transport. <br>
YARETH: Are you really a changeling? <br>
ODO: Yes, I suppose I am. Go on, we don't want to keep the Vulcans
waiting. Energising. <br>
(He beams them out) <br>
ODO: Computer, set a course for the wormhole. <br>
COMPUTER: Course laid in. <br>
ODO: Ready engines. Home. Where is it? Someday we'll know, cousin.
Engage. <br>
