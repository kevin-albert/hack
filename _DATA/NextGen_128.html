PICARD: With reason. <br>
TROI: About Worf or Commander Riker? <br>
PICARD: Both. I think it is perhaps best to be ignorant of certain
elements of Klingon psyche.

out with a metal tube. Meanwhile a second 'monster' with an axe is

RIKER: Exit Holodeck. You do this every day? <br>
WORF: No, Commander. Usually my calisthenics are more intense, but
those sessions are too personal to be shared. <br>

WORF: Computer. Programme complete. Save. Coming Commander? <br>

RIKER: It appears, then disappears, then reappears. No predictable
pattern, no sequence. <br>
PICARD: On screen. <br>
RIKER: There it is. <br>
PICARD: I can't see anything. Magnify section two eight five. <br>
WESLEY: There it is, sir. It's like a hole in space. <br>
PICARD: We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this? This
appears quite different. What do your sensors indicate? <br>
DATA: Nothing, sir. <br>
RIKER: Nothing? <br>
PICARD: Mister Data, you must mean it's empty of matter. There's always
some energy form at work. <br>
DATA: Sir, our sensors are showing that to be an absence of everything.
It is a void without matter or energy of any kind. <br>
RIKER: Yet this hole has a form, Data. It has height, width. <br>
DATA: Perhaps. Perhaps not, sir. <br>
PICARD: That is hardly a scientific observation, Commander. <br>
DATA: Captain, the most elementary and valuable statement in science,
the beginning of wisdom, is I do not know.
I do not know what that is, sir. <br>
WESLEY: Captain, if this were any ordinary kind of hole in space
wouldn't we be able to see what's behind it? <br>
PICARD: Counsellor? <br>
TROI: I know what you're asking, but I feel nothing from it. <br>
RIKER: Data, is there any record anywhere of any occurrence even
vaguely similar to this? <br>
DATA: Accessing. Negative, sir. There is no record of any Federation
vessel encountering anything remotely like this. <br>
PICARD: Indeed. I believe we have time to take a closer look, Number
One. <br>
RIKER: Concur. Ensign, slow down to half impulse power. Adjust
coordinates to intercept this, this whatever it is. <br>
PICARD: Scanning and recording as we go. <br>
WESLEY: Aye, sir. Adjusting course to intercept in twelve minutes, sir.
<br>
(Twelve minutes later, at the black whatever) <br>
PICARD: Let's launch a probe into it. <br>
RIKER: Worf, prepare a scanner probe. Let's see what's in there. <br>
PICARD: This is close enough, Ensign. Hold this position. <br>
WESLEY: Aye, sir. Holding this position. <br>
RIKER: You may fire the probe when ready, Mister Worf. <br>
(The probe is launched) <br>
DATA: All the probe's systems are functioning perfectly. <br>
WORF: It's gone. <br>
PICARD: Data, what happened? <br>
DATA: Unknown, sir. <br>
WORF: Recommend we go to a Yellow Alert, sir. <br>
PICARD: Why? Explain. <br>
WORF: Sorry, sir. It's <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, this starship operates best when my officers share
with me what is their minds. <br>
WORF: My thoughts were of an old Klingon legend of a gigantic black
space creature which was said to devour entire vessels. <br>
RIKER: Devour vessels? <br>
WORF: Sorry, Commander. I agree these are thoughts hardly worthy of a
trained and practical Security Officer. <br>
PICARD: Mister Worf, will you launch another probe. This time a Class
One with full sensor array. <br>
WORF: Launching, sir. <br>
(Off it goes, then - blink) <br>
RIKER: Happened even more quickly. <br>
WORF: Recommend we fire a photon torpedo, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Negative. <br>
WESLEY: Captain, based on where the probes disappeared I have been able
to plot the outer boundaries. I could move in closer. <br>
PICARD: Make it so, Mister Crusher. Thrusters only. Mister Data? <br>
DATA: Still no readings of any kind, sir. <br>
PICARD: Number One? <br>
RIKER: I'm going with Worf on this one. Let's be careful. <br>
PICARD: All right, that's enough, Ensign. Come to full stop and hold
these coordinates.&nbsp;<br>
WESLEY: Aye, sir. <br>
(The blackness leaps forward at them) <br>
RIKER: What's happened? <br>
PICARD: Data? <br>
DATA: Whatever it is, sir, we seem to be inside it. <br>
PICARD: It enveloped us. It moved. All stations, report. <br>
DATA: No response, Captain. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, supplemental. While exploring a
strange void in space without any form of matter or energy, we have
apparently moved past its outer boundary and entered it. After a brief
disruption, our ship's communications have returned to normal. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: All stations have reported, Captain. There
appears to be no immediate threat to our ship or the crew. <br>
PICARD: Let's hold this position for a while, Number One. This is worth
studying. <br>
RIKER: Incredible. It's like looking into infinity, sir. Remember the
course in ancient history at Starfleet Academy? About the time men
still believed the Earth was flat? <br>
PICARD: And that the sun revolved around it. <br>
RIKER: And that if a ship sailed too far out into the ocean, it would
fall off the edge of the world? <br>
PICARD: Beyond this place there be dragons. It's even said that crews
threatened to hang their captain from the yard arm if he refused to
turn back. <br>
RIKER: I'm sure no one here has that in mind, sir. <br>
PICARD: How comforting, Number One. <br>
WESLEY: Captain, we have no communications outside of the void. <br>
RIKER: Complete your scans, Data. Let's not stay any longer than we
have to. <br>
(Pulaski enters) <br>
PICARD: Hello, Doctor. Have you been briefed on what's happened? <br>
PULASKI: I heard, but I don't understand it, Captain. <br>
PICARD: I wish I could say I did. Increase magnification by ten. By one
hundred. <br>
PULASKI: Isn't this impossible, sir? I'm not a Bridge officer, but.
Increase by one thousand, Mister Data. By ten thousand. It does know
how to do these things, doesn't it? <br>
PICARD: Commander Data knows precisely what he is doing. <br>
PULASKI: Forgive me, Mister Data. I'm not accustomed to working with
non-living devices that. Forgive me again. Your service record says
that you are alive. I must accept that. <br>
PICARD: Engineering! <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: Engineering. <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant, are all your systems functioning? <br>
LAFORGE: Yes, Captain. Wherever we are, it seems to have no effect on
Engineering. <br>
PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. Data? <br>
DATA: Difficult to make a judgment, sir, based on the absence of
information. <br>
PICARD: Speculate. <br>
DATA: This void has a total lack of dimension. Therefore, by any
accepted standard, it does not exist, yet being within it denies that
conclusion. <br>
RIKER: Might we have moved into another dimension? <br>
DATA: Could a lack of dimension be another dimension in itself? <br>
PULASKI: That's an interesting question. <br>
PICARD: For a later discussion. Number One, I think we should get on
with our mission. Starfleet can send a science vessel back to
investigate further. Move us back out of here. <br>
RIKER: Aye, sir. Wesley, reverse our direction, set a course for the
Cornelian star system. Impulse power. <br>
WESLEY: Aye, sir. Reversing direction. Course laid in. <br>
RIKER: Engage. <br>
(We see the Enterprise whizz off, but nothing changes on the
viewscreen) <br>
RIKER: Your engines have engaged, haven't they, Ensign? <br>
WESLEY: Aye, sir.

monitor our velocity closely. <br>LAFORGE: Is everything all right up
there, Captain? <br>

(Geordi enters) <br>
LAFORGE: Engineering, transfer to Bridge. What's happening, sir? we
should be clear. <br>
RIKER: We should be. We're on a reverse course. <br>
PICARD: Full stop, helm. <br>
WESLEY: Full stop, sir. <br>
PICARD: According to this we're already well past the point at which we
entered the void. <br>
DATA: Except that we are still in it, sir. Captain, if we dropped a
stationary beacon and travelled straight away from it, we would have a
fixed point of reference to confirm speed and distance. <br>
PICARD: Make it so, Data. Lock onto the beacon. Keep it dead astern. <br>
DATA: The beacon is in place, Captain. <br>
(a regular sound like the bell of a buoy is heard) <br>
PICARD: Dead ahead. Impulse power. <br>
DATA: The beacon is falling astern, Captain. <br>

LAFORGE: All systems functioning normally, sir. <br>
PICARD: Prepare to increase to warp two. <br>

WESLEY: Aye, sir. <br>
DATA: Captain, we are receiving a signal from dead ahead. <br>
(and the bell returns, getting louder) <br>
PULASKI: Maybe you've found the door out of this. <br>
DATA: Closing on the new signal, sir. <br>
PICARD: Identify. <br>
DATA: Captain, it is the stationary beacon we just released. <br>
RIKER: We must have come full circle, sir. <br>
WESLEY: We couldn't have, sir. I've shown us steadily moving away from
that beacon. <br>
PICARD: Full stop. Hold this position again. <br>
WORF: Captain, sensors indicate a disturbance in sector one zero eight.
Possibly a vessel. <br>
PICARD: Perhaps some answers at last. On screen. <br>
WORF: The ship is equipped with a cloaking device. <br>
RIKER: Romulan! <br>
WORF: It's closing. <br>
RIKER: Shields up. Go to Red Alert! <br>
PULASKI: I'll be at my duty station. <br>
WORF: Main viewer locked onto coordinates. <br>

PICARD: Hold for my orders. <br>
WESLEY: There! <br>
WORF: It's uncloaking. <br>

shudders) <br>
WORF: Direct hit, sir. Our shields are weakening. <br>
PICARD: Warn them we'll return fire. <br>
WORF: Transmitting. They've armed another full spread, sir. <br>
PICARD: Fire torpedoes. <br>
(A single torpedo blows the warbird to atoms) <br>
PICARD: Oh, that was too easy. <br>
DATA: Captain, sensors can locate no debris from the Romulan ship. <br>
RIKER: Impossible. <br>
WORF: Captain, there's another vessel approaching in sector zero nine
one, mark two six. <br>
PICARD: On screen. Magnify. <br>
RIKER: It's a Federation ship. NCC one three zero five dash E. It's the
Yamato, our sister ship. <br>
WESLEY: The Yamato's nowhere near this quadrant. <br>
PICARD: Open a hailing frequency, Data. <br>
DATA: USS Enterprise to USS Yamato. Respond, please. USS Enterprise
calling USS Yamato. Respond, please, on this frequency. No response,
Captain. <br>
PICARD: Make a full scan. <br>
DATA: Life support system, engineering and propulsion all appear
functional. But there are no life signs, sir. <br>
PICARD: Data, can we be getting a false reading? <br>
DATA: Since we know nothing of these circumstances, it is at least
conceivable, sir. <br>
RIKER: You look doubtful, sir. <br>
PICARD: I'm not anything now, Number One. I'm just a man who's looking
for answers. <br>
LAFORGE: Like the rat said, 'Keep the cheese, I just want out of the
trap.' <br>
RIKER: Captain, request permission to board on the Yamato with an away
team. Perhaps something we can find on board in the logs will help us
figure out what happened. <br>
PICARD: Granted. Minimum complement. <br>
RIKER: Worf, you're with me.

in amber, trapped in the void. We have encountered a vessel which

DATA: Captain, sensors show nothing out there. Absolutely nothing. <br>
LAFORGE: Sure is a damned ugly nothing. <br>
PICARD: I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise.
representing a Federation of planets in this part of the galaxy. Can
you identify whoever or whatever you are? <br>
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: Nagilum. <br>
LAFORGE: Speaks right up for something your sensors say isn't there,
Data. <br>
PICARD: We still have no idea what you represent. <br>
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: Data. <br>
DATA: Nagilum? <br>
NAGILUM: You are of different construction than the others.
Interesting. Picard, Riker, Geordi, Haskell. What are you? Your
construction also differs. <br>
(Pulaski is suddenly whipped around like a puppet on a string) <br>
PULASKI: My construction? <br>
DATA: Perhaps referring to your gender, Doctor? <br>
PULASKI: Yes, well, there are minor differences. I'm what we call a
female. <br>
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: I understand. The masculine and the feminine. <br>
PICARD: It is the way in which we propagate our species. <br>
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: Please, demonstrate how this is accomplished. <br>
PULASKI: Not likely. <br>
PICARD: Whatever you are, your actions are not welcome. <br>
WORF: Let me put up the shields, sir. <br>
DATA: Sensors still show nothing out there. <br>
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: Your life form surprises me more and more. Is
it true you also have only a limited existence? Answer! <br>
PICARD: What information do you want? I don't understand the question. <br>
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: You exist and then you cease to exist. Your
minds call it death. <br>
(Haskell starts to shake, holds his head and screams before suffering
the fate usually reserved for red shirts) <br>
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: How interesting. <br>
PULASKI: He's gone. <br>
PICARD: We cannot allow you to do that! We will fight you. <br>
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: To understand death, I must amass information
on every aspect of it. Every kind of dying. The experiments shouldn't
take more than a third of your crew, maybe half.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, Stardate 42194.7. It is obvious that
whatever we have met sees no value in our kind of life form. How do we
fight something that both is and is not there?

WORF: In a battle for survival, Captain, thirty to fifty percent
casualties <br>
PULASKI: Would be appalling. <br>
WORF: But within acceptable limits. <br>
RIKER: This is not a battle, Worf. <br>
TROI: No. A laboratory experiment would be the closest comparison. <br>
PICARD: Is there any reason for not believing this Nagilum? <br>
TROI: No. <br>
DATA: All evidence indicates it is willing and able to do what it
proposes. <br>
PICARD: Agreed. Under the circumstances, I think there is only one
decision. I will not stand by while half of my crew is slaughtered. <br>
DATA: Sir. I do not believe there is anything you can do to prevent it.
<br>
PICARD: Yes, there is <br>
PULASKI: What? <br>
PICARD: Destroy the Enterprise. <br>
PULASKI: Isn't that a little like curing the disease by killing the
patient? <br>
RIKER: It's better than standing around helplessly. <br>
PULASKI: Why do get the feeling this was not the time to join this
ship?

COMPUTER: Desired time interval? <br>
PICARD: Stand by. Interesting question. How long to prepare to die? <br>
RIKER: What would be the least painful to our crew? Move to it quickly,
or allow them time to prepare for it thoroughly? Well, twenty minutes?
Nice round figure. <br>

PICARD: Come. <br>
(Troi enters) <br>
TROI: Our destroying ourselves won't change its mind, Captain. I would
feel that. <br>
PICARD: You didn't mention you were that certain. <br>
TROI: I was wrong not to tell you, Captain. And your decision may also
be wrong. <br>
(Door bell) <br>
PICARD: Yes. Come in, please. <br>
(Data enters) <br>
DATA: I have a question, sir. <br>
PICARD: Yes, Data. What is it? <br>
DATA: What is death? <br>
PICARD: Oh, is that all? Well, Data, you're asking probably the most
difficult of all questions. Some see it as a changing into an
indestructible form, forever unchanging. They believe that the purpose
of the entire universe is to then maintain that form in an Earth-like
garden which will give delight and pleasure through all eternity. On
the other hand, there are those who hold to the idea of our blinking
into nothingness, with all our experiences, hopes and dreams merely a
delusion. <br>
DATA: Which do you believe, sir? <br>
PICARD: Considering the marvellous complexity of our universe, its
clockwork perfection, its balances of this against that, matter,
energy, gravitation, time, dimension, I believe that our existence must
be more than either of these philosophies. That what we are goes beyond
Euclidian and other practical measuring systems and that our existence
is part of a reality beyond what we understand now as reality. <br>
TROI: We should not let ourselves die, Jean-Luc. <br>
DATA: I agree with her, Jean-Luc. <br>
TROI: If only half of us live, then I'd rather take my chances on being
one that does. <br>
DATA: Yes. It is wrong of you to force us. <br>
TROI: It is wrong. <br>
PICARD: Yes. This is very wrong. Neither of you should be reacting in
this way. Computer, locate Commander Data for me. <br>
COMPUTER: Commander Data is on the Bridge. <br>
PICARD: It's not going to work, Nagilum. <br>

RIKER: Captain? <br>
PICARD: It could all be part of the illusion. Commander Data, report. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PICARD: Well, Nagilum, I hope you got what you
needed. <br>
NAGILUM [on monitor]: You have provided me with much more than I
needed. <br>
PICARD: Why did you release us? You could have seen the way we face
death. <br>
NAGILUM [on monitor]: It wasn't necessary. I have learned all I needed
to know. Would you like me to share some of my conclusions? <br>
PICARD: I'm not interested. <br>
NAGILUM [on monitor]: Of course you are. You are too inquisitive not to
want to know. You seem to find no tranquillity in anything. You
struggle against the inevitable. You thrive on conflict. You are
selfish, yet you value loyalty. You are rash, quick to judge, slow to
change. It's amazing you've survived. Be that as it may, as species, we
have no common ground. You are too aggressive. Too hostile. Too
militant. <br>
PICARD: During this period, you too have been evaluated. It would seem
that we have at least one thing in common. <br>
NAGILUM [on monitor]: Oh? <br>
PICARD: Curiosity. <br>
NAGILUM [on monitor]: The point is well taken, Captain. Perhaps that is
a trait we share. <br>
PICARD: Then perhaps we'll meet again. But next time, it will be out
here, among the stars.
