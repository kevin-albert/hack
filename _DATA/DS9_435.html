<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: If it's an imposition <br>
O'BRIEN: No, sir, it's fine. <br>
SISKO: You're sure? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm sure, Commander. Jake's a good fellow. I'll enjoy working
with him. <br>
SISKO: I don't want you to make it easy for him, Chief. He has to know
what it takes to make it in Starfleet. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'll have him up to his elbows in thorium grease, sir. <br>
SISKO: It's not going to be easy for him. He placed in the lower third
of his age group in mechanical aptitude. <br>
O'BRIEN: Good for him. So did I. <br>
SISKO: You? Come on. <br>
O'BRIEN: No, it's true. It wasn't till I got to the Cardassian front I
found I had talents I never knew I had. <br>
SISKO: At the front? <br>
O'BRIEN: It was a matter of figuring out how to get a field transporter
operational in ten minutes or wind up a Cardassian prisoner of war.
Now, I didn't know a transporter from a turbolift in those days but
somehow, in nine minutes fifty three seconds, I got that thing to work.
I got thirteen men safely off the surface of Setlik Three. Next thing I
know I'm the tactical officer on the Rutledge. That's how I got the
gold suit. <br>
SISKO: Well, Jake's ready for a new suit too. The boy seems to grow a
centimetre each week. You know, he struck me out with a curve ball the
other day. First time. <br>
O'BRIEN: They grow up in a hurry, don't they, sir. <br>
SISKO: That they do. <br>
O'BRIEN: I think I've got one. Computer, set a new heading, four one
mark three zero one. <br>
COMPUTER: Confirmed. <br>
SISKO: It's an M class all right. One hundred and sixty million
kilometres from Orellius Minor. Should be a perfect place to set up a
colony. <br>
O'BRIEN: Only it looks like someone's beat us to it. <br>
SISKO: You're reading life forms? <br>
O'BRIEN: Human life forms. <br>
SISKO: I don't see anything on the books about a colony in the Orellius
system. <br>
O'BRIEN: Trying all hailing frequencies. <br>
SISKO: Moving into synchronous orbit. <br>
O'BRIEN: No response. I'm picking up some kind of low level duonetic
field down there. It may be blocking communications. <br>
SISKO: Let's introduce ourselves to our neighbours. </font></p>

SISKO: Yours too? <br>
O'BRIEN: Even the self-diagnostics aren't working. It's plain dead. <br>
SISKO: Sisko to Rio Grande. Computer, respond. <br>
O'BRIEN: (trying his phaser) I'd say there's no EM activity at all
around here. <br>
SISKO: Any idea why? <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm not sure, but it might have something to do with that
duonetic field our sensors picked up. <br>
SISKO: Well, I hope you find a few more of those talents you never knew
you had, because if you don't we're going to have a hard time getting
off this <br>
VINOD: Don't move! <br>
(A man is aiming an arrow at their backs, using a longbow. That's
deadly.) <br>
VINOD: And put your hands up. <br>
(After the opening titles) <br>
VINOD: Turn around. Slowly. <br>
JOSEPH: (older, stouter) They're from Starfleet. <br>
SISKO: That's right. Mind if we put our hands down? <br>
(Joseph gets Vinod to rest the bow) <br>
JOSEPH: The uniforms have changed, or have I just forgotten what they
looked like? My name is Joseph. Vinod's the one playing with the sharp
object. <br>
SISKO: Benjamin Sisko, and this is Miles O'Brien. <br>
VINOD: How did you get here? <br>
O'BRIEN: We were going to ask you the same thing. <br>
SISKO: We were surveying for habitable planets when our sensors picked
up your lifesigns. There was no record of a human colony here. <br>
JOSEPH: Our group was on its way to settle on Gemulon Five over ten
years ago when our ship developed life support problems, and we had to
land here for repairs. <br>
VINOD: Once we got here, all our systems failed. Nothing worked
anymore. <br>
O'BRIEN: So we've seen. <br>
JOSEPH: We've been stuck here ever since, and I guess you are too now. <br>
SISKO: We have a ship in orbit. It won't take our people long to find
us. <br>
O'BRIEN: We'll be able to get all of you out of here. <br>
JOSEPH: After ten years, this is our home. <br>
O'BRIEN: But you just said it yourself. Nothing works. <br>
JOSEPH: Well, we still do. Come, we'll show you. Vinod, run ahead and
tell your mother we have guests. Come.

people are in simple home-made clothes for agrarian living.) <br>
SISKO: Erewon-class personnel transport. <br>
JOSEPH: Commissioned the Santa Maria. Now, we just call it the Cabin. <br>
ALIXUS: (a red-headed woman) After all this time, visitors! <br>
JOSEPH: Alixus, meet Ben and Miles. <br>
ALIXUS: Welcome to our community. Miles. Are there others? <br>
SISKO: Just an empty runabout in orbit. Hopefully, it'll attract some
attention. <br>
JOSEPH: A runabout. Is that some kind of new Starfleet vessel? <br>
O'BRIEN: Yeah, they commissioned the first ones two years ago. They're
a short-range interstellar craft about a quarter the size of your cabin
here. <br>
JOSEPH: I was the engineer aboard the Santa Maria. <br>
ALIXUS: You and Miles will have a lot to talk about, Joseph. I'm sure
all of us have questions for our guests. <br>
VINOD: Who won the soccer matches this year? Is Golanga still playing? <br>
SISKO: No, he hurt his knee four years ago. They replaced it with a
bio-implant but he wasn't the same after that. Who was it that won last
year anyway? I never can remember. <br>
CASSANDRA: What are women's fashions like back home now? <br>
SISKO: Chief, you're the married one. <br>
O'BRIEN: Keiko, my wife, she's been replicating longer dresses lately. <br>
CASSANDRA: (deadpan) Oh, no. That means I'll have to alter everything I
own. <br>
(Laughter) <br>
O'BRIEN: That might just be the Bajoran styles she sees on Deep Space
Nine. <br>
JOSEPH: On Deep Space Nine? <br>
ALIXUS: I'm sure Ben and Miles will be happy to tell us everything we
want to know. There'll be plenty of time for that later. <br>
O'BRIEN: Actually, the first thing I'd like to do is to try and get
some response from the EM systems. <br>
ALIXUS: We gave up any hope of that years ago. <br>
SISKO: Yes, we noticed a low-level duonetic field in the area before we
transported down. <br>
ALIXUS: Yes, the same thing appeared on our sensors when we were
landing. Our engines failed almost the instant we hit the surface. <br>
JOSEPH: Without a functional tricorder, it was virtually impossible to
track down the source. <br>
ALIXUS: We do know that the marshes all around us are filled with
astatine deposits. That's the only explanation we have. But we've done
pretty well without our tricorders and EM converters and comm. links
haven't we? After all, the human body is a powerful tool. We can plow
the crops, harvest the fields, construct the walls that we need for
protection against the wilderness, weave clothes that we need to stay
warm. In a way, we've rediscovered what man is capable of without
technology. It hasn't been easy. We've had some bitter winters and
we've lost some dear friends. But we're very proud of what we've
accomplished here. <br>
SISKO: You have every right to be. <br>
CASSANDRA: Are we all going to leave when the others come to rescue
them? <br>
ALIXUS: That's something each of us is going to have to think about,
isn't it. <br>
CASSANDRA: Are you going to leave, Alixus? <br>
ALIXUS: Speaking for myself, no. No, I'll never leave. And I'll never
want what we have in our community to change. It means too much to me.
But while you are here, you are welcome to everything our community has
to offer. The only thing we ask is that you contribute. We all work for
our supper. You'd be surprised how much sweeter it tastes when you do. <br>
SISKO: We'll be happy to do our part. <br>
ALIXUS: Joseph, would you find them some bunks, please? <br>
(Joseph leads Sisko and O'Brien away, and Alixus goes to Vinod) <br>
ALIXUS: Two more strong, healthy men, Vinod. That could mean an awful
lot to this community.

DAX: Best poker player in the fleet, next to me. <br>
KIRA: Well, he's diverting the Crockett to stop at DS Nine day after
tomorrow to talk about Cardassian foreign policy? <br>
DAX: That's just an excuse to get Benjamin in a game. Mitsuya cleaned
him out last year. We'd better hail the Rio Grande and get them back
this way. I've worked two lifetimes on Benjamin's poker. He just can't
learn how to bluff. <br>
KIRA: That's odd. <br>
DAX: I know. You'd think a man like Benjamin <br>

hand-written book) <br>
O'BRIEN: Commander. <br>
SISKO: Come in, Chief. I'm just reading one of the books our host has
written. Alixus is quite a prolific author. <br>
O'BRIEN: A bunch of these were left in my room too. I haven't had a
chance to look at them. What does she write about? <br>
SISKO: She seems to have something to say on just about everything. <br>
O'BRIEN: Yeah? <br>
SISKO: Economic analysis, political commentaries, literary critiques.
She says she's spent her life examining the human condition. <br>
O'BRIEN: What's her prognosis? <br>
SISKO: Not very good. She says we've become fat and lazy and dull. <br>
O'BRIEN: My wife told me something along those lines just last week. <br>
SISKO: (reading) The common conceit that the human species has evolved
over the last several centuries is ludicrous. What gains we have made
have come at the cost of our own core identities. Man has lost touch
with his true power. <br>
O'BRIEN: Sounds like it took a crash landing for her to find her
paradise.

SISKO: Have you found anything in their ship that can help us restore
contact with the runabout? <br>
O'BRIEN: There's nothing to find. Waveguides, conduits, baffle plates.
You name it, it's gone. The ship looks like it's been through a Ferengi
junkyard. <br>
SISKO: What happened to it all? <br>
JOSEPH: We threw it away. Well, since none of it worked, to us it was
merely useless junk taking up space. <br>
SISKO: Alixus felt its presence was a constant reminder of who you used
to be. <br>
JOSEPH: Well, we all had to abandon our dependence on technology.
Removing every trace of it, well, that made the transition easier. <br>
O'BRIEN: As an engineer, you must've had some problems with that. <br>
JOSEPH: I was the last convert. But as time passed, I realised Alixus
was right. She was helping us discover a new philosophy of life
together, because we needed one to survive. And I'll tell you, every
one of us is better for it. We're more committed to each other. We are
truly a part of each other's lives. We've renewed a sense of community
that man left behind centuries ago. <br>

JOSEPH: Please. <br>
ALIXUS: We have an insect here that transmits a disease we haven't
found a cure for. We've lost three to it already. <br>
SISKO: Have you found anything in the forest like the sleeger fungi? <br>
JOSEPH: We've searched everywhere for the right fungus or root that
would draw out the infection. <br>
SISKO: If it keeps spreading, she'll die before the rescue team finds
us. <br>
O'BRIEN: The medical kit in the runabout could probably take care of
this in a second. <br>
SISKO: We've got to find a way to restore the comm. link to the
transporter. <br>
ALIXUS: It would only be a waste of time. <br>
O'BRIEN: This duonetic field inhibits energy flow, but a duonetic field
is a form of energy too. Maybe we could modify our communicators to run
on the field itself. <br>
JOSEPH: Do you really think you could? <br>
ALIXUS: No. If you want to put your efforts to good use, search the
forest for something else we might use. <br>

ten years, we wouldn't have been doing what was necessary to survive
here. To find the plants, herbs, molds that cure disease. We've
conquered seventeen illnesses with the most powerful resource man has.

worked for, Ben. <br>

rescue party again. Until they come, if they come, you'll have to do
things our way. I'd strongly advise you get rid of that uniform. By mid
