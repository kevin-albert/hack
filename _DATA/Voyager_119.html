<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Kim
has detected strange compounds in space.) <br>
JANEWAY: Rust?<br>
KIM: That's right, Captain. High levels of ferric oxide. Corroded iron
particles.<br>
JANEWAY: Would you mind telling me how iron could rust in space without
oxygen?<br>
KIM: I wish I could.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Paris, alter our course to follow that trail of rust.
One quarter impulse.<br>
PARIS: Aye, Captain.<br>
(Later, on long range sensors.) <br>
KIM: Captain, look at this. I'm picking up traces of complex
hydrocarbons in the rust. Benzene, ethylene, acetylene.<br>
PARIS: That sounds like gasoline.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Gasoline?<br>
PARIS: It's a liquid fuel that was used centuries ago on Earth. They
burned it to drive internal combustion engines.<br>
JANEWAY: How did it get out here?<br>
TUVOK: I'm detecting a small object. It appears to be the source of the
rust and hydrocarbons.<br>
JANEWAY: Put it on screen. Magnify. <br>
(They all stare at one of Henry Ford's products, floating in space.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Cargo
bay]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (The
pick up has been brought on board.) <br>
TUVOK: Apparently it is a ground vehicle from mid-twentieth century
Earth.<br>
PARIS: It's a 1936 Ford, actually.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Paris?<br>
PARIS: That was the manufacturing date, 1936. Ford was the name of the
company that build it. Antique vehicles are a hobby of mine. <br>
(He opens the bonnet, sorry, pops the hood, and whistles.) <br>
PARIS: Internal combustion engine, a reciprocating piston cylinder
design, fuel source was a refined petroleum. Gasoline. <br>
KIM: So is this an early hover car?<br>
PARIS: No, you're about a century too early for that. This is about one
step ahead of the horse drawn carriage.<br>
TORRES: Traces of potassium nitrate, ammonium and methane back here.<br>
JANEWAY: I think you'll find that's manure. Horse manure, if I'm not
mistaken. Judging from the mud on the wheels, and the alfalfa seedlings
stuck in the metal frame, I'd say this vehicle belonged to a farmer, or
at least someone who lived in a rural area. But the question is, how
did it get here? I doubt there are many twentieth century farmers
driving around the Delta Quadrant. <br>
TUVOK: There are no signs of any wormholes or temporal anomalies in
this region of space.<br>
JANEWAY: Let's run a metallurgical analysis of the vehicle.<br>
PARIS: There's still oil in the crank case, water in the radiator. I
wonder if the battery's still charged. Now, let's see. This is before
voice command activation, so there should be something in here called a
key. Key.<br>
(Paris gets into the driver's seat.) <br>
KIM: What are you doing?<br>
PARIS: Trying to bring this beauty back to life. Now where are the
keys? Ah ha. Here they are. Okay, choke out, clutch in, give her a
little gas, turn the key and step on the starter. <br>
(The engine grinds into life with a series bang and cloud of smoke from
the exhaust. Everyone dives for cover except Tuvok, who draws his
phaser.)<br>
PARIS: Sorry. <br>
JANEWAY: Next time you might give us a little warning, Mister Paris.<br>
PARIS: Aye, Captain.<br>
TUVOK: I suggest we increase the ventilation in the cargo bay before we
are asphyxiated.<br>
KIM: What's that?<br>
PARIS: That is an amplitude modulation receiving device. AM radio. Not
sure we'll pick up much out here. <br>
(Beep, beep, beep.) <br>
PARIS: Whoa. What was that?<br>
(Di di di, dah dah dah, di di di.) <br>
TORRES: What is that?<br>
KIM: It's too regular to be random interference.<br>
TORRES: I'm running the signal through the ship's database. It's an
ancient Earth distress call known as an SOS. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
I've located the source of the SOS signal. It's coming from a planet in
a star system bearing three one zero mark two one five.<br>
JANEWAY: Mister Paris, lay in a course.<br>
PARIS: Aye, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Why didn't we pick up this signal earlier?<br>
KIM: This isn't one of the standard frequencies we monitor. Messages on
this channel only travel at the speed of light. Too slow for
interstellar communications.<br>
PARIS: Course laid in, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Warp six. engage. <br>
(Later - ) <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: I'll run a diagnostic check, sir.<br>
(The crewman leaves Paris.) <br>
JANEWAY: Bring us out of warp. Full scan, Mister Kim.<br>
KIM: The SOS signal is coming from the third planet. It's class L,
oxygen argon atmosphere. <br>
JANEWAY: Any life signs? <br>
KIM: There's a great deal of trinimbic interference in the upper
atmosphere. I can't get a clear reading of the surface. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Can you pin point the coordinates of the distress call? <br>
KIM: Yes, here it is. It's coming from a continent in the northern
hemisphere.<br>
CHAKOTAY: We won't be able to transport through this kind of
interference. I might be able to take an away team in a shuttlecraft.<br>
TUVOK: That would not be wise, Commander, as the atmosphere is charged
with trinimbic turbulence. A shuttlecraft could not safely navigate the
currents. <br>
JANEWAY: We could land the ship.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Are you sure that's necessary?<br>
JANEWAY: Someone on this planet is sending out a distress call.<br>
CHAKOTAY: If that someone is as old as the truck in the cargo bay,
they're long dead by now. This might be an automated distress call. <br>
JANEWAY: Possibly. But something brought that truck half way across the
galaxy, and that something might be down on that planet.<br>
CHAKOTAY: And if it brought the truck here, it might be able to take us
home too.<br>
JANEWAY: I'd say it's worth a look. Mister Paris, prepare the ship for
landing.<br>
PARIS: Captain, I think I should tell you I've never actually landed a
starship before.<br>
JANEWAY: That's all right, Lieutenant, neither have I. Bridge to
Engineering. We're going to land the ship, Miss Torres. Take the warp
core offline, vent all plasma from the nacelles and standby to engage
atmospheric thrusters.<br>
TORRES [OC] Aye, Captain.<br>
TUVOK: This is LieutenantTuvok to all decks. We are preparing to land
the ship. Go to blue alert and report to code blue stations. <br>
PARIS: I've plotted a descent course. How close do you want to land to
the distress coordinates? <br>
JANEWAY: No closer than two kilometres. <br>
PARIS: Okay. Atmospheric controls at standby. Landing mechanisms
online. Inertial dampers at maximum.<br>
TUVOK: All decks report condition blue, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Put her down, Mister Paris. <br>
(Voyager descends into the atmosphere.) <br>
JANEWAY: Status.<br>
PARIS: We're on the glide trajectory. Altitude one hundred kilometres,
speed ten thousand kph. Encountering some trinimbic turbulence.
Compensating.<br>
(A big judder and a console explodes.) <br>
KIM: We have an EM discharge in the lateral relays. I'm rerouting the
ODN conduit. <br>
PARIS: Come on. <br>
KIM: Another EM discharge. I think we're all right. though. <br>
PARIS: Twenty kilometres to the landing site. We should be able to see
it now.<br>
JANEWAY: Extend landing struts. Prepare to release inertial dampers and
adjust them to match the planet's gravity. <br>
PARIS: Landing struts down and locked.<br>
KIM: Standing by environmental controls.<br>
PARIS: Here we go. <br>
(Voyager touches down gently.) <br>
PARIS: Disengaging engines, securing thrusters exhaust. We're down. <br>
JANEWAY: Not bad, for a beginner. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Planet

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Nice day.<br>
KIM: I've locked onto the distress signal. It's one point five
kilometres on a bearing of two four six.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Wait a second, I've got something else. There's a high
concentration of trianium particles bearing two two five, a little over
a kilometre away. Looks like some kind of power source.<br>
JANEWAY: Two teams. Chakotay, yours investigates the power source.
Tuvok, Kim, you're with me. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Outside

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: My god.<br>
(Janeway's group go down the slope to the apparently intact twin
engined Lockheed Electra monoplane, and scan it.) <br>
TUVOK: The metal is an aluminium alloy. It appears to be an ancient
Earth aircraft. <br>
KIM: The SOS call is coming from inside. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Inside
the aircraft]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
I've found the AM transmitter. From what I can tell, it's sending out
an automated SOS.<br>
JANEWAY: What about the power source? Somehow I find it hard to believe
the battery on this aircraft has been running for four hundred years.<br>
KIM: I don't recognise the power signature. Hold on, Captain, I've
found what appears to be an alien fusion based generator. It's hooked
up to the AM transmitter.<br>
CHAKOTAY {OC]: Chakotay to Janeway. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Outside

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
CHAKOTAY: Of the trianium readings. It appears to be some sort of mine
shaft. I'd like to bring out another security detachment before we go
inside. <br>
JANEWAY [OC]: Good idea. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Outside

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Good idea. I'll join you. Janeway out. (to Tuvok) I want the
two of you to analyse the alien generator. Then see what you can find
out about this SOS call. <br>
(They are watched by a figure all clothed in black.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Tunnels]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TORRES:
I'm picking up something directly ahead. Some kind of power signature,
fusion based.<br>
(Janeway leads the team and extra security into -) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Cryochamber]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (A
high-tech area with walls lined with eight vertical cubicles. The doors
are transparent and the insides are lit.) <br>
TORRES: This looks like some kind of cryostasis chamber.<br>
JANEWAY: How many bodies are there?<br>
TORRES: Eight. And the equipment is still functioning.<br>
(Janeway wipes the dust from the first cubicle.) <br>
JANEWAY: He's human. And from the clothes I'd say he's from the same
era as the vehicle we found.<br>
(He is oriental. His cap has a single golden star on it.) <br>
TORRES: His life sign readings are minimal, but he's alive.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, according to these readings there are five other
cryostasis chambers nearby. No life signs in any of them. This appears
to be the only one with people inside.<br>
TORRES: There's another male over here.<br>
JANEWAY: This one's a female. She's wearing some sort of leather jacket
and a pair of gold wings. Wait, there's a name tag here. I think it's A
period E A R H A R T. Earhart. A Earhart. Amelia Earhart! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Briefing
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> KIM:
Who's Amelia Earhart?<br>
JANEWAY: She was one of the first female pilots in Earth History. In
the mid twentieth century she became quite famous for flying across the
Atlantic Ocean. In 1937 she attempted to fly around the world.
According to the records of the time, on July 2nd 1937 Earhart and her
navigator, Fred Noonan, took off from New Guinea and they were headed
east, around the Equator. But somewhere in the South Seas they vanished
and their disappearance became one of the most celebrated mysteries of
the twentieth century. <br>
PARIS: Why didn't they think she'd just crashed? <br>
JANEWAY: That was the most commonly held theory. However, numerous
searches of the area failed to produce the wreckage of an aircraft, so
people began to speculate. Some thought she'd been shot down and
captured by the Japanese Navy. Others thought that she and Noonan had
flown off together on some sort of romantic adventure. Of course, the
most ridiculed notion was that she had been abducted by aliens. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Well, it certainly looks like that's what happened. From what
we can tell, all eight of the people in that stasis chamber were taken
from Earth in the 1930's and brought here. <br>
KIM: The question is, why? And where are the aliens who did this? <br>
TUVOK: Scans of the region show no alien life signs. <br>
JANEWAY: Continue the scans. They may not be here now, but once they
detect our presence, they might return. In the meantime, we'll have to
get some answers on our own. Have you had any luck tapping into the
computer system in the cryochamber? <br>
TUVOK: Not as of yet. We are having difficulty decoding the operating
system. <br>
PARIS: There's one way we could find out what happened. We could wake
those people up and ask them. <br>
JANEWAY: I've had the same thought myself. <br>
TORRES: Is that wise? We don't know how these people are going to react
when they wake up in an alien world in the twenty fourth century. <br>
JANEWAY: True, but I'm not willing to just leave them in stasis for
another four hundred years. And if we can find out how they were
brought here, we might be able to use that method to get home. We'll
just have to be very careful how we handle this. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I suggest that only human crew members be present when we
revive them. <br>
JANEWAY: Agreed. Mister Kim, I want a complete analysis of those
cryostasis tubes. Find a way to deactivate them safely. <br>
KIM: Aye, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Commander, appraise the Doctor of our situation. Tell him to
instruct Kes in the proper procedure for reviving someone from
cryostasis. She can be made to look human easily enough. In the
meantime I suggest we all brush up on ancient Earth. We're about to
meet a bit of our history. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Cryochamber]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PARIS:
We're ready, Captain. <br>
KIM: All the cryo-tubes are linked by a common power source, so we've
decided to revive everyone simultaneously. <br>
JANEWAY: Proceed. <br>
KIM: The power's offline. Deactivate locking mechanisms. <br>
(The doors on the cubicles slide upwards, and dry ice pours out. Kes
hands hypos to Paris and Kim.) <br>
PARIS: Captain, this one's armed with some kind of weapon. <br>
JANEWAY: Disarm him, just to be on the safe side. <br>
(Paris takes the Japanese soldier's gun then give him the hypo, while
Kim revives Amelia. Kes does Noonan and the negro farmer. They start to
wake. Janeway walks up to Amelia and smiles. Shortly afterwards,
everyone is awake and Kes is scanning them.) <br>
JANEWAY: I know this must be very strange for you.<br>
NOONAN: Who are you? What is going on here? <br>
NOGAMI: I demand you release me immediately. <br>
JANEWAY: Please, if you'll just listen for a moment, I'll try to
explain. <br>
NOGAMI: You are all speaking Japanese. <br>
HAYES: (the farmer) Sounds to me like you are speaking English. <br>
JANEWAY: It's because of a device we have. A universal translator. It
allows us to talk to each other even though our languages aren't the
same. <br>
AMELIA: Who are you people? <br>
HAYES: Look, just let us go home. We won't tell anybody. <br>
NOONAN: The hell we won't! I'm going to let the world know what you
people have done. Do you know who you've kidnapped here? Amelia
Earhart. I'm her navigator. This is going to be headline news. You
people are in trouble. <br>
AMELIA: Fred, let her talk. <br>
JANEWAY: What I'm going to tell you is going to sound hard to believe.
Even preposterous. We think you were abducted from Earth in the 1930's
and brought millions of miles through space to a planet on the other
side of the galaxy. You were put into a kind of deep sleep for a very
long time. It's not the 1930's any more. The year is 2371, over four
hundred years from the time you were abducted. <br>
AMELIA: You must think we are awfully gullible. <br>
JANEWAY: Tell me, what's the last thing you remember before waking up
here? <br>
AMELIA: We were over the Pacific, running low on gas. We were looking
for an atoll to set down. We tried to send out an SOS and suddenly
there was this huge light in back of us. And the plane stopped, dead.
And then it started moving backward towards the light. I must have
blacked out. And I woke up here, just now. <br>
HAYES: That's just the way it was with me! I was in my truck heading
into town. I was just about to get onto the blacktop, when this big
light come down from the sky. Just about blinded me. Next thing I know
the whole truck is lifted up off the ground. <br>
JANEWAY: I believe what happened was that you were abducted by aliens,
and if we can find out how they got you here, we might all be able to
get back to Earth. <br>
(Noonan takes out a revolver he had under his jacket.) <br>
NOONAN: I want some real answers, now. <br>
JANEWAY: I assure you, I am telling the truth. <br>
NOONAN: You! Come on down here and get those funny looking guns of
theirs. <br>
(Hayes obeys.)<br>
NOONAN: (to Kes) You, get over there with the others. <br>
(Amelia takes the tricorder from Kes.) <br>
AMELIA: What is this? <br>
KES: It's a medical device. I'm just trying to make sure that everyone
is all right. <br>
NOONAN: Now, how do we get out of here? <br>
(Amelia opens the tricorder, starting it beeping.) <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Chakotay to away team. <br>

was a time when no one believed that a woman could fly across the
Atlantic. Now, people are able to travel between the stars. The galaxy
is full of many different species. For instance, this young woman isn't
human, she's an Ocampa. <br>
(Janeway pushes back Kes's hair to reveal her pointed ears.) <br>
AMELIA: I've been on expeditions all over the world, and I've seen
people do all kinds of strange things to their bodies. That doesn't
mean that Martians have invaded Earth. <br>
KIM: Actually it was the other way around. Mars was colonised by people
from Earth in 2103. <br>

Maybe I can get through to her. Miss Earhart? <br>
(Amelia walks over.) <br>
JANEWAY: I want you to know you've always been an inspiration to me.
Because of you, generations of women have become pilots. <br>
AMELIA: Generations. What's your name? <br>
JANEWAY: Kathryn Janeway. <br>
AMELIA: I heard the Commander call you Captain. What exactly do you
captain? <br>
JANEWAY: The Federation Starship Voyager. <br>
AMELIA: Starship. That supposed to mean it flies through space? <br>
JANEWAY: That's right. <br>
AMELIA: That isn't possible. Only in books. H G Wells, Jules Verne. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe if you saw it you'd think otherwise. <br>
AMELIA: Saw it? Where is it? <br>
JANEWAY: On the surface. We're actually about a hundred metres
underground now. If you'd come with me to see Voyager, you'd realise
that what we're telling you is true. <br>
AMELIA: And risk a trap? No, you could have hundreds of reinforcements
up there. <br>
JANEWAY: I assure you, we have no interest in harming you. We took you
out of stasis to help you. <br>
AMELIA: Put yourself in my shoes, Captain. If you were me, would you
believe your story? <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe not. Let me tell you some of what happened after you
disappeared over the Pacific. No trace of you or your plane was ever
found, in spite of a massive search. Over the years there was a lot of
speculation about your flight, including the rumour that it was
financed by the Government and may have been part of an operation to
gather information about the Japanese. <br>
AMELIA: Where did you hear that? <br>
JANEWAY: It's somewhat common knowledge. You see, Japan attacked Pearl
Harbour in 1941, drawing the United States into a massive world war. In
retrospect, your journey was seen in a different light, perhaps as part
of an intelligence mission devised by a Government deeply concerned
about Japanese war plans. <br>
AMELIA: No one was supposed to know about that. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe not in 1937, but now it's part of history. <br>
NOONAN: Hey, I've got an idea. Why don't we stick them in these things?
Put them to sleep like we were. No fuss, no trouble. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Noonan, that will accomplish nothing. Please, let us
take you to our ship. You'll see that everything we've told you is
true. <br>
NOONAN: Show me how to operate this thing. <br>
AMELIA: Hey! Last time I looked, you were working for me. And I think
we should listen to these people. They just may be telling the truth.
What's the harm in seeing if maybe they do have this starship? Beats
being cooped up in here trying to figure out what happened. How about
it? Anyone want to come along? <br>
HAYES: I wouldn't mind taking a look. <br>
JANEWAY: Anyone else? <br>
NOONAN: You're not leaving me behind. <br>

EVANSVILLE: Human? <br>
(He turns to his companion, who nods. They remove their hoods to reveal
that they are a man and a woman.)<br>
EVANSVILLE: We're human. You're working for the Briori. They have ships
like yours. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll answer any questions you have, but first we must take
care of our wounded. Can we agree to end this? <br>
EVANSVILLE: Yes. <br>

AMELIA: He's not going to make it. <br>
EMH: I wouldn't be so sure of that. Vascular regenerator. Hmm. He's not
responding to the treatment. The alcohol level in his blood is so high
it's inhibiting the repair to his circulatory system. Attempting to
compensate. <br>
AMELIA: Told you your drinking'd kill you one day. <br>
NOONAN: She's right, Doc. Just let me die in peace. There's just one
thing I want to say to you first, even though it's four hundred years
late. Amelia, I love you. <br>
AMELIA: Fred. You never said anything. <br>

EVANSVILLE: You've taken the 37s. Why? <br>
JANEWAY: I'm afraid I don't understand. <br>
EVANSVILLE: You went into the shrine. You stole the 37s from the sacred
altars, and you disturbed the radio signal that we have been so careful
to preserve. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, I think he's talking about Earhart and the others. <br>
JANEWAY: Tell me more about the 37s? Are you one of them? <br>
EVANSVILLE: I'm one of their descendants. The 37s were brought here
over fifteen generations ago by the Briori. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Who are the Briori? <br>
EVANSVILLE: They're an alien race. They abducted over three hundred
people from Earth in the year 1937, brought them over here, turned them
into slaves. But those slaves revolted, killed the Briori, took their
weapons and their technology and survived. And now there are over one
hundred thousand of us. The Briori never came back. Now, you answer me.
Why did you steal the remaining 37s from the shrine? <br>
JANEWAY: We didn't steal them. We simply revived them. <br>
EVANSVILLE: Revived them? They're dead. <br>
JANEWAY: No, they were simply in a state of what we call cryostasis.
That's a form of sleep that appears very much like death. <br>
EVANSVILLE: Do you mean they're alive? <br>
JANEWAY: Yes. <br>
EVANSVILLE: My people have come to regard the 37s as monuments to our
ancestors. Nobody has even entered their shrine for generations. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Evansville, we were hoping to find the ship that
brought your ancestors here. Possibly use it to get back to Earth a
little faster. <br>
EVANSVILLE: I'm sorry, the Briori ship was destroyed in the slave
revolt. There's nothing left. Captain, I'm sorry to hear about your
long journey home, but you should know that life on this planet is
good. We live in three beautiful cities only fifty miles from here. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, I'd like to see your cities. <br>
EVANSVILLE: And I'd like to show them to you. </font></p>

AMELIA: How fast? <br>
PARIS: Warp nine point nine. In your terms, that's about four billion
miles a second. <br>
AMELIA: Think I could take her out for a spin? <br>
PARIS: Well, er <br>
(Janeway enters with Evansville.) <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Evansville has offered to take us on a tour of the
settlement. He's extended the invitation to the entire crew, and the
37s, of course. <br>
EVANSVILLE: You, you're a 37? <br>
(Janeway nods.) <br>
AMELIA: I guess you could call me that. <br>
EVANSVILLE: It would be an honour to show you our cities. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Come in. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Here's the damage report you asked for. <br>
JANEWAY: Thank you. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Is something wrong, Captain? You've seemed a little
distracted ever since we came back from the cities. Weren't you
impressed? <br>
JANEWAY: A little too impressed. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What do you mean? <br>
JANEWAY: There's a thriving, sophisticated culture on this planet. Of
human beings. In someways walking around those cities was almost like
being back on Earth. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It was a little eerie. It reminded me of home, too. <br>
JANEWAY: Evansville has offered to let any of our crew stay. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What will you do about that? <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe this is one of those decisions that the captain has to
make for the entire ship. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You may have a problem if a lot of people want to stay. <br>
JANEWAY: I know that, but at the same time I can't take a vote every
time there's a major decision to be made. And yet, we're a long way
from Starfleet, and a lot of the rules and regulations I've learnt to
uphold seem distant as well. Am I the only one who's so intent on
getting home? Is it just me? Am I leading the crew on a forlorn mission
with no real hope of success? <br>
CHAKOTAY: You're not alone. I want to get home, too. And there's not a
day that goes by when I don't hear someone mention Earth. <br>
JANEWAY: The people here have built a new Earth. We could stay, help
them build a human civilisation in the Delta Quadrant. Isn't that an
exciting prospect? Shouldn't we be grateful for the opportunity they're
giving us? <br>
CHAKOTAY: It is a tempting prospect, but when I hold it up against the
prospect of seeing the sun rise over the Arizona desert, or swimming in
the Gulf of Mexico on a summers day, there's just no comparison. I want
to go home. <br>
JANEWAY: We have one hundred and fifty two men and women on this ship.
What happens if half of them decide to stay on the planet? Could we
operate Voyager with seventy five crew members? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I doubt it. In fact I don't think we could operate the ship
with fewer than one hundred. If too many of the crew choose to stay
behind, we could all be stranded here. <br>
JANEWAY: Tell all hands to prepare for an announcement from the Captain
at fourteen hundred hours. They deserve to make the choice for
themselves. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. </font></p>

NEELIX: Here we are! My research on twentieth century Earth is a little
thin, but I've done what I can. Pot roast, green beans and something
called Jell-O. <br>
NOONAN: You know how to make Jell-O? <br>
NEELIX: I even put in fruit cocktail. <br>
NOONAN: You don't say. <br>
HAYES: I don't know about the rest of you, but I've made up my mind.
There is land here that goes begging, and I could have a big farm, just
like I always dreamed. <br>
NEELIX: And for you, rice with a little fish. I even replicated some
ginger for seasoning. <br>
NOGAMI: Very nice, thank you. <br>
NOONAN: I have to admit, life here looks a lot better than what we left
on Earth. <br>
NOGAMI: It's paradise by comparison. And there are many Japanese here.
I could be very happy. <br>
NOONAN: We all could. Right? <br>
AMELIA: I'm just not sure. What about you, Mister Neelix? Have you made
your decision? <br>
NEELIX: Oh yes, indeed. I'm staying right here with Captain Janeway.
She'd be lost without me. She's come to depend on me a great deal. <br>
NOONAN: What about the rest of the crew? Do you think many of them will
stay here? <br>
NEELIX: Oh, I don't think so. At least, not many. Well, that is,
there's a good chance. Well, now that you ask, I honestly don't know. <br>
(At another table.) <br>
TORRES: You? You'd stay here on the planet? <br>
KIM: I didn't say I was going to, I just said I could understand why
people would want to. The people here remind me of home. I haven't felt
like that since I left Earth. <br>
TORRES: But you're Starfleet. You've always wanted a life in space. <br>
KIM: I know, but, my whole life on a starship, day after day, with no
end in sight? That's not exactly what I had in mind. <br>
TORRES: You're not the first person I've heard talk like this. A lot of
people are thinking about staying. <br>
KIM: What about you? Don't you have some of those feelings? <br>
TORRES: I'd be lying if I said I didn't. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Outside

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> AMELIA:
Captain. I was told I'd find you here. Am I intruding? <br>
JANEWAY: Not at all. Please join me. <br>
AMELIA: I wanted you to know that the group you brought out of stasis,
we've all decided to stay here on the planet. <br>
JANEWAY: I understand. <br>
AMELIA: I must admit the thought of travelling through space, maybe
even learning to fly this ship, was very appealing to me. <br>
JANEWAY: And I'd looked forward to getting to know you better. I
suspect we have a lot in common. <br>
AMELIA: At first I didn't know what to do. We talked about it for quite
some time. Finally I realised the people here on this planet are part
of us. We're their ancestors in a way. It made us feel close to them. <br>
JANEWAY: The remarkable thing about the humans on this planet is that
they evolved very much like the people on Earth. Tens of thousands of
light years apart, both civilisations managed to create a world they
could be proud of. One where war and poverty simply don't exist. I
certainly can't blame you for wanting to be part of it, any more than I
can blame members of my crew if they make the same decision. <br>
AMELIA: When will you find out? <br>
JANEWAY: In half an hour. Any one who wants to stay behind is to report
to the cargo bay at fifteen hundred hours. </font></p>

CHAKOTAY: I expect Jarvin will stay on the planet. In fact, I'd bet on
it. <br>
JANEWAY: Why Jarvin? <br>
CHAKOTAY: He's been more uncomfortable about being on a Starfleet ship
than most of the Maquis, and he's gotten involved with a young woman in
Quantum Mechanics. I think they'd like to settle down, raise a family. <br>
JANEWAY: The person I expect to see is Baxter. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Baxter? Walter Baxter? <br>
JANEWAY: He's adventurous, a risk taker. I can see him wanting to take
on the challenge of building a new life on this planet. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'd hate to loose Baxter. He's a good man. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd hate to loose Jarvin. I don't want to loose anyone. We've
all been through so much together, it just wouldn't seem right. But I
couldn't blame anyone, anyone for staying behind. I'm not sure I want
to go in. <br>
