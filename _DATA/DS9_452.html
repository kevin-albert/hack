OKALAR: Well. <br>
MARDAH: Come on. Aren't you feeling lucky? <br>
OKALAR: All right then. One more time. Let it ride. <br>
(Uh-oh.) <br>
MARDAH: Karjinko. Sorry. <br>
(Mardah leaves the wheel.) <br>
OKALAR: Wait a minute there. My name is Okalar. What's yours? <br>
MARDAH: Busy. <br>
(Mardah takes a glass from a tray and goes to sit with Jake.) <br>
JAKE: You are evil. <br>
MARDAH: Who, me? <br>
JAKE: He was going to walk away a winner. <br>
MARDAH: The first rule of dabo is watch the wheel <br>
BOTH: Not the girl. <br>
MARDAH: So, what's on the menu tomorrow night? Tomorrow night? Dinner
with your father? <br>
JAKE: What? <br>
MARDAH: He didn't tell you? He came by this afternoon and invited me to
dinner tomorrow night. In fact, he said it was your idea. <br>
JAKE: My idea? Oh, I guess I might have mentioned something about
having you over. I thought he forgot. <br>
MARDAH: It is all right, isn't it? I mean, you don't mind, do you? <br>
JAKE: Oh, no. No, of course not. It'll be great. You're going to love
my dad's cooking. <br>
(As the young people gaze into each other's eyes, Quark is tallying his
takings when a purple-haired female comes and strokes his lobes.) <br>
QUARK: This is a surprise. <br>
BOSLIC: A pleasant one, I hope. <br>
QUARK: So do I. <br>
BOSLIC: I have some salvage for you, Quark. <br>
QUARK: This isn't a good time to be selling your kind of salvage. <br>
BOSLIC: Oh, it's perfectly legal and it's really salvage this time. <br>
QUARK: I'm not looking for junk right now, but I'm more in the market
for entertainment. <br>
BOSLIC: I think you'll like this junk, Quark. It's wreckage from a ship
that crashed in the Gamma Quadrant. <br>
QUARK: You're still going to the Gamma Quadrant? I love bold women. How
much? <br>
BOSLIC: Three bars of latinum and you can have it all. <br>
QUARK: What kind of ship is it? <br>
BOSLIC: I don't know. <br>
QUARK: Can I see it first? <br>
BOSLIC: There's no time. Quark, you and I have been doing business for
years. Don't you trust me?

SISKO: You bought a child? <br>
QUARK: I just thought that I was buying some wreckage. How was I
supposed to know there was a baby in there? <br>
SISKO: Maybe you should inspect the merchandise before you make the
deal. Or isn't there a Rule of Acquisition for that? <br>
QUARK: There is and I do, usually. <br>
(Dax enters) <br>
DAX: We haven't been able to trace the Boslic Captain since she left
the station. Her flight plan said she was headed for Risa, but I don't
think we should put much faith in that. <br>
BASHIR: Well, I haven't been able to identify his species, but he seems
to be healthy. <br>
SISKO: Seems? <br>
BASHIR: For a humanoid, he has an incredibly fast metabolic rate. The
cells in his body are dividing at a pace I haven't seen outside of a
laboratory, but since there are no thyroid or hypothalamic problems, I
assume this is only natural for someone of this species but I would
like to do further tests. <br>
SISKO: Very well. What do we know about the ship the boy was on? <br>
DAX: Chief O'Brien just started to analyse the wreckage. We should have
a preliminary report in a couple of hours. <br>
QUARK: Now wait a minute. I paid good money for that wreckage and <br>
(Sisko gives him a Look.) <br>
QUARK: And now it's yours. Enjoy. <br>
(Quark leaves and Sisko picks up the baby.) <br>
SISKO: Hi there. <br>
DAX: We should contact one of the orphanages on Bajor and let them know
we might have someone for them. <br>
SISKO: Hmmm? <br>
DAX: I was talking about an orphanage. <br>
SISKO: Oh, right. Have Major Kira make the appropriate arrangements.
And keep me informed about him. <br>
BASHIR: Yes, sir.

DAX: I haven't seen that look on your face since <br>
SISKO: Since Jake stopped wearing diapers. I never thought I'd hear
myself saying this but, I miss taking care of Jake when he was a baby.
I miss holding him, singing to him at night, feeding him. <br>
DAX: Listening to him cry, changing his diapers, worrying when he was
sick. <br>
SISKO: I haven't forgotten. But there are times when I would give
almost anything for the days when I could make Jake happy just by
lifting him over my head. Good night.

SISKO: Hey, how about a hug for the old man? <br>
(Jake turns away from him.) <br>
JAKE: Why didn't you tell me you were going to invite Mardah to dinner?
<br>
SISKO: Well I did, weeks ago. I told you if you didn't invite her soon,
I'd invite her myself. <br>
JAKE: I still wish you'd given me a little more warning. <br>
SISKO: I didn't realise that a dinner invitation required so much
warning. <br>
JAKE: It doesn't, and it's not a problem or anything. It just caught me
by surprise. <br>
SISKO: Well, dinner isn't till tomorrow night. That'll gives you a full
day to prepare her for the traumatic experience of having dinner with
the old man. <br>
JAKE: Yeah. I mean, there's nothing to prepare for. It's just dinner. <br>
SISKO: Exactly. <br>
JAKE: Right. <br>
SISKO: Right. <br>
JAKE: All right. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: You wanted to see me, Doctor? <br>
BASHIR: Yes, it's about our new visitor <br>
SISKO: Is something wrong with the baby? <br>
BASHIR: No, but he's not a baby any more. <br>
(A young boy is sitting on a bed, with a hint of scales on his
forehead.) <br>
BASHIR: There are a great many species with what we would consider
accelerated growth rates. But they're usually small, physiologically
simple creatures. I've never seen such a rapid maturation process in
anything as complex as a humanoid. <br>
SISKO: He looks about eight or nine years old. How old is he in
reality? <br>
BASHIR: Well, judging by his cellular kinetics profile, I'd say he's no
more than two weeks of age. <br>
BOY: Who are you? <br>
SISKO: I'm Benjamin, and that's Julian. Do you have a name? <br>
BOY: I need food. <br>
BASHIR: With your kind of metabolism, I'm not surprised. I'll get you
something in a few minutes. <br>
BOY: Where am I? <br>
SISKO: On a space station. Do you know what that is? <br>
BOY: No, but I want to learn. <br>
SISKO: I'd say we have a lot to learn from each other. <br>
BASHIR: I'll be right back. <br>
(They move away.) <br>
SISKO: Advanced language skills. <br>
BASHIR: And cognitive reasoning. He didn't just pick those up by
sitting there listening to us. This is either a natural ability of his
species or there's been some kind of basic intelligence implanted into
his genetic structure. <br>
SISKO: Implanted? You mean artificially? <br>
BASHIR: Yes. And I tend to discount the possibility that it is a
natural ability. His biomolecular diffusion gradient already suggests
that his cellular mitosis has been artificially enhanced. <br>
SISKO: So, you're saying he may have been part of some experiment? <br>
BASHIR: Possibly. If so, he's an example of some very advanced genetic
engineering. His cognitive abilities are developing without any
external stimuli. <br>
SISKO: I want you to test his mental abilities. See if they increase.
Maybe he'll get to the point where he can tell us who he is and where
he's comes from.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'BRIEN: This is where Quark said he found the boy.
It seems to be some kind of stasis chamber that was damaged in the
crash. <br>
SISKO: That could imply that they didn't want him to begin maturing
while he was on board. What about the rest of the wreckage? <br>
O'BRIEN: It seems to indicate this was some kind of freighter or
transport vessel. <br>
SISKO: Did you find any computers or other information systems? <br>
O'BRIEN: No, not yet. Most of it's just junk. Twisted bulkheads, burnt
deck plating, that sort of thing. We should have a full inventory done
by tomorrow morning. <br>
SISKO: Good. By the way, the replicators in my quarters' on the blink
again. Could you spare someone this afternoon to fix them? <br>
O'BRIEN: That's right. Tonight's the big dinner with Mardah. <br>
SISKO: You know about that? <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, Jake mentioned it this morning. In fact, I'd say it's
the only thing on his mind. <br>
SISKO: You would think I was going to court martial her by the way he's
acting. <br>
O'BRIEN: Well, I guess it's only natural. Bringing a girl home for the
first time's a pretty traumatic experience. <br>
SISKO: Quark may call her a dabo girl but she's twenty years old. She's
a woman and Jake's a sixteen year old boy. It has to stop. <br>
O'BRIEN: Why did you invite her over, if you don't mind my asking. <br>
SISKO: Curiosity, mostly. I wanted to see what I was up against. <br>
O'BRIEN: What if it turns out you like her? <br>
SISKO: She's a dabo girl and she's dating my son. I don't want to like
her. <br>

O'BRIEN: Sixteen years old and dating a dabo girl. Godspeed, Jake.

ODO: I want to make this room into a place where I can explore what it
truly means to be a shape-shifter. <br>
KIRA: I thought it had to be something like that. I mean, you don't
exactly need an entire set of quarters just to sit in your bucket. <br>
ODO: I don't use the bucket anymore. I've kept it to reminder of how I
used to be. But now, when I need to regenerate, I simply revert to my
gelatinous state anywhere in these rooms. Here, I can experiment with
different shapes, textures. I can bring in various forms to emulate,
and I can do it in private. <br>
KIRA: I'm sorry if I intruded. Maybe I should leave. <br>
ODO: No, please. You're always welcome here, Major. <br>

altered. The nucleotide analysis proves that conclusively. <br>
DAX: So he's a product of genetic engineering. But why? Was he a unique
experiment or is this sort of thing common to his species? <br>
BASHIR: There's more. His blood chemistry shows he's missing a key
isogenic enzyme. Without large quantities of it his circulatory system
would simply shut down. <br>
DAX: Can you replicate this enzyme? <br>
BASHIR: I've been trying and I think I've come up with a temporary
substitute, but what I don't understand is why anybody would want to
genetically engineer someone with such an obvious flaw. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: I've just spoken with Starfleet Command.
They want to make sure he's healthy enough to travel and then send him
to Starbase two oh one where he'll be handed over to a team of
specialists. <br>
KIRA: Sounds good to me. The sooner, the better. <br>
ODO: What sort of specialists are we talking about, Commander? <br>
SISKO: There will be a complete team xenobiologists and
exopsychologists waiting for him. <br>
ODO: So they're going to study him like a laboratory specimen. <br>
SISKO: He'll be very well treated. <br>
ODO: So he'll be a well treated specimen. <br>
BASHIR: I have to agree with Odo, Commander. We can't just ship him off
like some biological sample that we've found. He's a sentient life
form. <br>
DAX: True, but the Founders could have removed his sense of free will.
He may be nothing more than a genetically programmed killing machine. <br>
KIRA: I agree. We don't want one of them walking around this station. <br>
ODO: Fine. If you want answers about the Jem'Hadar, I'm the one who can
get them for you. Let me get to know him. I'll be responsible for his
conduct while he's here. <br>
SISKO: Odo, do you really think you can control him? <br>
ODO: He's already shown a certain deference to me. That's probably
another genetic alteration implanted by the Founders to insure the
Jem'Hadar's loyalty. I can keep him from harming anyone. <br>
SISKO: I'd like to speak with the Constable in private for a moment,
please. <br>
(Bashir, Dax and Kira leave.) <br>
SISKO: Talk to me, Odo. Tell me what's really going on here. What the
Founders did to the boy, to all the Jem'Hadar, is not your fault. <br>
ODO: Maybe not, but I feel an obligation to undo some of the damage
that my race has done to this boy. And I also know what it's like to be
a specimen in a laboratory. Oh, I'm sure they'll treat him very well.
No one will risk harming their new prize. They'll be courteous, caring,
treat him like he's among friends, but in the end he'll be just another
specimen to them, something to be analysed and cataloged. Give me a
chance to find out if he really is just a programmed killing machine or
if we can help him become something else. <br>
SISKO: I'll tell Starfleet we have some preliminary tests to run before
we send him to Starbase two oh one. <br>

ODO: Addicted? <br>

ODO: Can you replicate this enzyme? <br>
BASHIR: I've had some success with triglycerides, but they're just a
stopgap measure. I can't get an exact chemical formula without doing
further tests, but he's shown a certain resistance to that idea. <br>

ODO: You should rest now. We'll talk later. I'll be in my quarters. <br>
JEM'HADAR: Wait. I want to go with you. <br>
ODO: The doctor will take care of you. <br>
JEM'HADAR: I want to stay with you. <br>
BASHIR: He doesn't have to stay here as long as I can monitor his
condition regularly. <br>
ODO: Well, it seems I have my first houseguest.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JEM'HADAR: So you can change into any of these
objects? <br>
ODO: With varying degrees of success. Some forms are more difficult to
emulate than others. <br>
JEM'HADAR: Like what? <br>
ODO: Like this one. As you can see, I haven't mastered the humanoid
face. I've found it to be quite challenging. <br>
JEM'HADAR: Why do you want to look like a humanoid? You're better than
they are. You're a changeling. <br>
ODO: That doesn't make me better, just different. <br>
JEM'HADAR: But I know in here that I am inferior to you. But that
everyone else here is inferior to me. <br>
ODO: No. That may be what your instincts tell you, but it's not true.
No one on this station is better than anyone else. We're all equal. <br>
JEM'HADAR: Then I must be at fault, because I know that you cannot be
wrong. <br>
ODO: The first thing we have to establish is that I'm not infallible.
I'm no different than you are in that respect. You have to begin to
think for yourself, to make decisions based on what you want, not what
I want. Do you understand? Now tell me, what do you want right now?
Don't think about it. Just tell me the first thing that comes to mind. <br>
JEM'HADAR: I, I want, I want to know more about my people. Who I am and
where I come from. <br>
ODO: I can understand that. I was also found by aliens. I didn't know
who I was or what my people were like. <br>
JEM'HADAR: Did you ever find them? <br>
ODO: Yes, but sometimes the truth is not very pleasant. Computer,
display Bridge Security log USS Defiant, stardate 48214.5, time index
three one zero. <br>
(The boarding of the Defiant is on the monitor.) <br>
JEM'HADAR: These are my people? <br>
ODO: Yes. They're a race of brutal warriors, but that doesn't mean you
have to be like that. You can channel your feelings of aggression in
other ways. <br>
JEM'HADAR: How?

(A figure appears.) <br>
JEM'HADAR: So this is not a real person? <br>
ODO: That's right. He can't be injured or killed. He's just a computer
simulation. <br>
JEM'HADAR: How strong is he? <br>
ODO: As strong as you want to make him. The computer will adjust his
strength, agility, speed, anything you want. In here, you can indulge
yourself. You can let your instincts take over, fight until you're
ready to stop. But at a price. Out there you have to control yourself.
You have to learn restraint. Learn how to live peacefully among other
races regardless of how you may feel, learn to contain your feelings of
aggression and violence. <br>
(Weapons appear.) <br>
JEM'HADAR: Can I? <br>
(Odo nods, and he attacks the figure. He easily wins bout one) <br>
JEM'HADAR: Can I do it again? Can I have a stronger opponent? <br>
ODO: Computer, increase difficulty to level two. <br>
(Bout two begins.) <br>
JEM'HADAR: It's too easy. Make it more difficult. <br>
ODO: Computer, increase to level three. <br>

KIRA: Can I speak to you for a moment? <br>
(Kira and Odo leave) <br>

ODO: It was his idea. He feels safer around me. <br>
KIRA: Of course he does, Odo. He was programmed to feel that way. <br>
ODO: It's more than that. I think I've begun to form a real connection
with him. He trusts me. <br>
KIRA: But can you trust him? How long do you think you're going to be
able to control him? <br>
ODO: I'm not trying to control anybody. I'm just trying to give him
some choices other than becoming a laboratory specimen or a Jem'Hadar
soldier. <br>
KIRA: I never thought I would say this to you, Odo, but you are
listening to your heart not your head. That boy was created in a
laboratory. His body, his mind, his instincts, are all designed to do
one thing. To kill. <br>
ODO: My body, mind and instincts were designed to be a Founder. You
were trained to be a terrorist. But each of us chose to be something
different. I just want to give him the same chance we've had. <br>
KIRA: All right. Give him a chance. Just don't forget he is a
Jem'Hadar. He's dangerous. <br>
ODO: I'm well aware of the risk, Major. <br>
KIRA: I hope so.

ODO: Is that all you can think about? Killing? Isn't there anything

JEM'HADAR: I don't think so. <br>

SISKO: Starfleet is sending the USS Constellation to pick up the boy
and then take him to Starbase two oh one. They'll be here in five
hours. <br>
ODO: I thought we had an agreement. <br>
SISKO: I'm sorry, Odo. Starfleet considers the boy a top priority. I
did everything I could, but orders are orders. I put <br>

JEM'HADAR: A runabout. <br>
SISKO: To go where? <br>
JEM'HADAR: That's not your concern. <br>
ODO: Listen to me. This is not the way. <br>
JEM'HADAR: I know what I'm doing. I'm leaving this place and you're
going with me. You don't belong here any more than I do. <br>
ODO: All right. It won't be necessary to hurt anyone. Commander Sisko
will see to it that no one interferes with us. <br>

JEM'HADAR: To the Gamma Quadrant. It's where my people are. It's where
your people are. It's where we both belong. <br>
ODO: I don't belong there. I don't believe you do either. <br>
JEM'HADAR: I won't allow them to put me in a laboratory. I won't go
with them to Starfleet. <br>
ODO: All right, but there are another options besides going to the
Gamma Quadrant. We can find a place where neither Starfleet nor the
Jem'Hadar will bother you. A place where you can grow and learn about
yourself without worrying about being sent to some laboratory. It's a
big galaxy. All we have to do is head out for unexplored space and keep
on going. I am willing to do this with you, to help start you on this
new life, if that's what you want. <br>
JEM'HADAR: You just don't understand, do you? I want to be with my
people. I don't want to be anywhere else. I'm not like these other
humanoids. I'm a Jem'Hadar and that's what I want to be. You're not
like these humanoids either, but they've done something to you. They've
filled your mind with ideas, with these beliefs. I don't know what the
other Changelings are like, but I know they're not like you. <br>
ODO: No, they're not.

SISKO: This is as far as you go. <br>
ODO: Let us go, Commander. I'm leaving of my own accord. I'll take the
boy back to his people then return in the runabout. If he boards the
Constellation when it arrives, he'll either kill a lot of innocent
people or be killed himself. <br>
SISKO: What makes you think he'll let you come back? <br>
ODO: I don't believe he could injure a Changeling. <br>
SISKO: When the Constellation arrives I'll tell them that I couldn't
stop you from leaving, that I would've had to kill the boy to keep him
here. Admiral Necheyev won't like that answer but it has the virtue of
being the truth. Sisko to O'Brien. Release the security fields around
the airlock, Chief. <br>
O'BRIEN [OC]: Aye, sir. <br>
SISKO: I'll see you when you get back. <br>

JEM'HADAR: He was afraid of me. I could see the fear in his eyes. <br>
ODO: Commander Sisko was trying to do what's best for you. He was
trying to help you. <br>

anyone who is not a Jem'Hadar is my enemy. <br>
