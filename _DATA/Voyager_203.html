KES: I can't get any response from the field coils. <br>
PARIS: Did you verify the control inputs? <br>

CHAKOTAY: Good news and bad. We have located an M class planet, and it
shows high amino acid and protein readings. <br>
JANEWAY: That should indicate a healthy plant life. What's bad about
it? <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's a full day out of our way. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't think we have any choice. It's the first chance we've
had to replenish our supplies in weeks. <br>
CHAKOTAY: And our long range sensors can't confirm any plant life on
the surface. <br>
JANEWAY: Why not? <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's one strange planet, Captain. It's shrouded. Vapours
cover it like a curtain. EM disturbances all over the atmosphere. <br>
JANEWAY: Some of these readings suggest a planet early in its
evolution, almost like a primeval Earth. <br>

Planet Hell. <br>

EMH [on monitor]: Of course, it wouldn't be necessary for me to
eavesdrop if I were included in these discussions as a matter of
operating protocol. <br>
JANEWAY: Doctor. <br>
EMH [on monitor]: You should be aware that trigemic vapours at the
recorded levels can cause severe humanoid skin irritations. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Could you provide some sort of skin protection that might
help? <br>
EMH [on monitor]: I am whipping up a batch of dermal osmotic sealant as
we speak. Nevertheless, skin exposure to the atmosphere should be
limited. <br>
JANEWAY: Noted, Doctor. Thank you. Tell me, just how often do you
eavesdrop? <br>
EMH [on monitor]: I am simply trying to monitor issues involving the
health of the crew, Captain. When activated, the Emergency Medical
Programme establishes comm. links with all key areas of the ship, and I
have, on occasion. I am a Doctor, not a voyeur. I am programmed to be
discreet. <br>

operations to discuss. <br>
NEELIX: Gentlemen. May I recommend the Alfarian hair pasta today? <br>
KIM: Hair pasta? That is just an expression, isn't it? <br>
NEELIX: Not at all. It's actually made from the follicles of the mature
Alfarian. We harvest the hair during shedding season in early fall.
It's very high in protein. <br>

to believe that there are food sources on this planet, but we can't
transport to the surface. You're going to take a shuttle down and do a
little scouting. <br>

We're modifying the transporter to try and penetrate the atmosphere. So
far, no luck. <br>
KIM: However, we have been running computer simulations to determine if
the EM disturbances follow any specific pattern. Our data analysis
suggests that there may be occasional atmospheric windows that would
allow us to get through. <br>
CHAKOTAY: How occasional, and how long would they last? <br>
KIM: We should see one every thirty hours or so, but they may only last
for a matter of minutes. I can't be sure yet. <br>
JANEWAY: At least long enough for us to beam up food supplies. Mister
Paris, you and Mister Neelix will collect as many vegetables and fruits
as you can while we wait for this atmospheric window to open. Mister

physical fight over me. <br>

EMH: You should consider it a high compliment. Throughout history, men
have fought over the love of a woman. Why, I can quote you autopsy
reports from duels as far back as 1538. <br>

Tom are completely unjustified. <br>
EMH: Are they? Lieutenant Paris's affection for you is obvious. <br>

pupils dilate and the colouration of his ears turns decidedly orange.

detail as I see it, yet <br>

EMH: You're only two years old. There may be a few things you don't
know to look for in a man. In time, you'll understand. <br>
KES: On my homeworld it's so much simpler. You choose a mate for life.
There's no distrust, no jealousy, no envy, no betrayal. <br>

EM disturbance patterns match the computer simulations. I'd say we'll
get a shot at an atmospheric window in about fifty three minutes. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Where does that leave us with the transporter? <br>
TORRES: Our range will still be limited, but the transporter should
work as long as we stay in an area with reduced electromagnetic
activity. <br>
JANEWAY: The problem is we don't know where our shuttle went down. <br>
CHAKOTAY: So there's no way to know how close they'll be to the window
when it opens. <br>
JANEWAY: Recommendations? <br>
TORRES: Take the ship through the window into the atmosphere. The
closer you can get us to the surface, the better our chances for a
successful beam out. <br>
JANEWAY: Get on it. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Are you going to be able to warn us before the window closes
again? <br>
KIM: I think so. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Kim, that's not an answer I can live with. <br>
KIM: I'll try to get you a better one, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok, we need you to find a way to get us by that
ship. <br>
TUVOK: I have anticipated your request, Captain. Am I correct in the
assumption that you will want to use minimal force? <br>
JANEWAY: Assumption confirmed. <br>
TUVOK: I cannot guarantee success. My evaluation of their weapon
systems suggest a capacity equal to our own. However <br>
JANEWAY: You've come up with an ingenious plan to neutralise them. <br>
TUVOK: I have. In my analysis of our first encounter, I have detected
what I believe to be a vulnerability in their shield configuration.
There appears to be a slight phase retraction when auxiliary power is
transferred to their aft weapons systems. <br>
CHAKOTAY: A covariant phaser pulse into their aft control systems might
disable their entire weapons array. <br>
TUVOK: That was my ingenious plan, Commander. You are correct. <br>
JANEWAY: Very well. Red alert. Mister Kim, set coordinates. Torres,
speed at two thousand kph. <br>
TORRES: Aye, Captain. Chakotay, take the helm. <br>
KIM: Coordinates entered. <br>
JANEWAY: Engage. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
This creature's going to have the ability to stand upright. It has the
skeletal system of a humanoid. It's cold-blooded, has reptilian
epidermis. Its brain is significantly larger than most reptilian
species. I'd say we're dealing with a sentient life form here, Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: If this species is sentient, wouldn't that suggest that its
parents might return to care for it? <br>
PARIS: It's hard to say. Most common reptiles lay their eggs and never
return to protect them. <br>
NEELIX: I think we've established we're not dealing with a common
reptile. <br>
PARIS: True. And if this thing does have a mother, I'd say we don't
want to be around when she gets back. Come on. <br>
NEELIX: We can't just leave it here. <br>
PARIS: We're not leaving it here, its mother left it here. We just
happened to wander in. <br>
NEELIX: But we blocked off the cave. The mother might have been trapped
outside. <br>
PARIS: We'll leave the door open for her when we go, okay? <br>
NEELIX: Look. It's not that simple. What if she can sense we were here?
She, she might be able to smell that faux lime aftershave of yours. I'm
sure you realise many species won't return to a nest after it's been
tampered with. <br>
PARIS: There's not much we can do about that now, is there? We should
just leave all this the way we found it. <br>
NEELIX: No. <br>
PARIS: Neelix! <br>
NEELIX: This creature is our responsibility. <br>
PARIS: Ours? <br>
NEELIX: The moment we came in here, it became our responsibility. <br>
PARIS: And you expect to take care of this thing until what? It
graduates from high school, college? And what if Mom doesn't come back?
Are you planning to bring this with us back on the ship? <br>
NEELIX: Look, if she does return and accepts the hatchling, it'll solve
everything. We just have to wait and see what she does. I don't know
how it is in your quadrant, but in mine we don't abandon a new-born
thing. <br>
PARIS: Fine. Fine. You made your point. I officially designate you its
godfather. <br>
NEELIX: It's stopped crying. <br>
PARIS: It's shivering. That's normal, isn't it? I mean, new born life
forms do shiver, don't they? <br>
NEELIX: To be honest, I haven't been around many new borns. <br>
PARIS: Me neither. <br>
(Neelix swaddles the baby in his jacket.) <br>
NEELIX: Oh, look at this, Paris. It's stopped shivering. <br>
PARIS: It's asleep. Forget what I said, Neelix. You're not its
godfather. You're its godmother. </font></p>

atmospheric window is forming, Captain, thirty degrees off the
predicted co-ordinates. <br>
JANEWAY: How soon will we have maximum aperture, Mister Kim? <br>
KIM: Nine minutes. <br>
JANEWAY: All right, Commander, let's try to draw some fire from their
aft weapons systems. Bring us within ten kilometres. <br>
(The alien ship fires as Voyager flies past it.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Shields at eighty percent. <br>
TORRES: Minor damage to our port nacelle. Rerouting power to lateral
thrusters. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: So far I'm not detecting the same vulnerability in their shields
this time, Captain. We may have to resort to additional force. <br>
JANEWAY: Arm photons. <br>
KIM: Ready. <br>
JANEWAY: Prepare to <br>
TUVOK: Stand by, Captain. I'm detecting an opening. <br>
(The aliens fire again. Voyager replies with one shot.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PARIS:
Oh, come on. Come on. It doesn't seem to care for Starfleet rations. <br>
NEELIX: If I were in my kitchen, I could cook you up some delightful
leola root broth. <br>
PARIS: Are you serious? Ugh. I hope I never see another leola root. And
you're certainly not feeding any of that hideous broth to my niece. Or
nephew. Whatever it is. <br>
PARIS: Its heartbeat is getting weaker. I don't like it. Come on, kid.
You've got to eat something. <br>
NEELIX: It seems far more interested in my jacket than your food. <br>
PARIS: Neelix, it's not your jacket. It's the residue of the trigemic
vapours we walked through. Think about it. Voyager's sensors picked up
high levels of proteins and amino acids, which we assumed meant this
was a planet filled with vast supplies of edible plant life. <br>
NEELIX: We were certainly wrong about that. <br>
PARIS: The residue is a concentration of proteins and amino acids. <br>
NEELIX: The perfect source of nutrition for the hatchling. <br>
PARIS: The source we cut off when we blocked the cave. Come on. We've
got some rocks to move. </font></p>

least seventeen minutes before it starts to close. <br>
TUVOK: Captain, the alien vessel is in pursuit. <br>
JANEWAY: Are their weapons systems back online already? <br>
TUVOK: Negative. They are still disabled. <br>
CHAKOTAY: They couldn't be preparing to ram us, could they? <br>
JANEWAY: Hold your course. We need to get through that window but
prepare to take evasive action if necessary. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Understood. <br>
TUVOK: Alien vessel closing to one thousand kilometres. Five hundred.
Three hundred. It has passed us and is proceeding toward the surface. <br>

It's not breathing! I don't think it's breathing! Come on. Suck in some
of those hearty vapours. <br>
PARIS: It's just too weak. <br>
NEELIX: There must be something in here we can use to resuscitate it. <br>
PARIS: Neelix, we did the best we could. <br>
NEELIX: No! It's our fault. It's our fault. If we hadn't come. Here.
Cordrazine. This is a stimulant. <br>
PARIS: You can't pump it full of drugs without knowing its body
chemistry. <br>
NEELIX: So we should just let it die? <br>
PARIS: Give me that. <br>
(Paris takes a empty hypo from the emergency kit.) <br>
PARIS: When I was a kid, a baby bird fell out of a nest and landed on
the windowsill next to my bed. We had to feed it water with an
eyedropper to keep it alive. <br>
NEELIX: What are you doing? <br>
PARIS: Filling the eyedropper. Can you hold its mouth open? <br>
(Paris blasts the contents of the hypo into baby's mouth.) <br>
NEELIX: Do it again. Again. <br>
NEELIX: It's working. It's working! <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TORRES:
Sensors are operating as well as can be expected under these
conditions. Either we're just not close enough to where they landed to
pick up their comm. signals, or they never landed. The shuttle might
have burned up in the atmosphere. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm not willing to concede that yet. Any sign of the alien
ship? <br>
TORRES: No, Captain. We've lost them. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Kim, how much longer before that window starts to

NEELIX: I feel I owe you an apology. <br>
PARIS: No, you don't. <br>
NEELIX: I had no right to push that pasta in your lap. <br>
PARIS: Well, think of it this way. You saved me from having to eat it.
Nothing personal, but I just don't have an affinity for hair in my
food. <br>
NEELIX: I haven't been fair to you. You know, I hear people talking
about you in the mess hall. <br>
PARIS: No kidding. What do they say? <br>
NEELIX: Oh, that you used to be a coward and couldn't be trusted. It's
typical of Kes that she would befriend someone like you. Someone who
really needs a friend. And I guess I just got a little jealous. I got
more than a little jealous. I realise now I was wrong. <br>
PARIS: Neelix, I told you the truth when I said that nothing happened
between me and Kes. <br>
NEELIX: I know. <br>
PARIS: And I promise you nothing ever will. But you weren't wrong about
me. <br>
NEELIX: What do you mean? <br>
PARIS: I, well, I guess the only way to say it is to say it. I am
attracted to Kes. <br>
NEELIX: Oh? <br>
PARIS: To be honest, if you weren't around, I'd be knocking at her
door. But I respect you, Neelix. And that's that. Everything you heard
those guys saying about me, well, it was true. But it's not who I am
anymore. At least not who I want to be. This upside down mission to the
wrong side of the galaxy has given me a second chance, and I don't
intend to blow it. <br>
NEELIX: I see. Well, in a way I can't say I blame you. She is very
attractive. <br>
PARIS: She's devoted to you, you know. <br>
NEELIX: Well, I did save her life. I'm sure she's grateful. <br>
PARIS: Oh, she's a lot more than grateful. She loves you, Neelix. I
wouldn't stand a chance. Nobody would. <br>
NEELIX: There are others? <br>
PARIS: If you ever doubt yourself, just look into her eyes. See the way
she looks at you. You'll never doubt yourself again. And as far as I'm
concerned, I'll just be her friend. I mean, if you don't mind. <br>
NEELIX: I don't pick Kes's friends for her. Just my own. <br>
