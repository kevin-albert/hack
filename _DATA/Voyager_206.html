Voyager was pulled into the Delta Quadrant by an entity known as the
Caretaker.<br>
CARETAKER: Not enough time!<br>
When he died, Voyager's best chance of getting home died with him, but
he revealed one hopeful possibility.<br>
CARETAKER: There is another like me. She left hundreds of years ago,
but she's out there, somewhere. </font>

Kes.) <br>
TUVOK: Open yourself to the impressions around you. The thoughts, the
minds that are on this ship. What do you hear? <br>
KES: Voices. So many voices.<br>
TUVOK: I believe you are sensing the thoughts of various crewmembers on
board. <br>
KES: What should I do?<br>
TUVOK: See if you can isolate one of the voices. Imagine you are
listening to a symphony and focusing on a single instrument. <br>
KES: It's working.<br>
TUVOK: Try to maintain your emotional equanimity. You should not be
concerned with success or failure.<br>
NEELIX [OC]: way too much now. Don't touch the sideburns. <br>
KES: It's Neelix! I can hear Neelix's thoughts.<br>
TUVOK: That is not unexpected. You have an emotional attachment to him
which may have drawn your focus.<br>
NEELIX [OC]: My scalp itches. Maybe I should tell him about that
shampoo of his.<br>
KES: I think he's getting a haircut.<br>
NEELIX [OC]: Oh no! He's trimmed the ear hairs. I told him the ear
hairs were the perfect length! Not the ear hairs!<br>
(Kes laughs, and Tuvok breaks the link.) <br>
TUVOK: If you are to succeed in honing your telepathic abilities, you
must learn to control these emotional outbursts. <br>
KES: Outburst? It was a giggle. <br>
TUVOK: Tomorrow I will teach you a Vulcan mind control technique that
will help you inhibit your giggles. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
You're late. <br>
KES: Sorry. My lesson with Lieutenant Tuvok went on a little long
today. <br>
EMH: Today, yesterday and the day before. You'd think a Vulcan would be
more attuned to punctuality. <br>
KES: I'll try to keep a closer eye on the time from now on. <br>
EMH: So, how was school today? <br>
KES: Wonderful. Tuvok helped me with a sensory focus exercise. We
worked on my pre-cognitive skills and I learned how to self-induce a
hypergogic mental state. <br>
EMH: Sounds stimulating. <br>
KES: He says I'm making excellent progress.<br>
EMH: I had no doubt that you would. But I'd appreciate it if you
wouldn't let these mind studies interfere with your <br>

KES: What's that? <br>
EMH: I don't know. <br>
(They walk through to another area, the Medical lab?, where the EMH
opens a cupboard to reveal the Caretaker's desiccated remains are
rattling in their clear container. Then it stops. A little later,
Janeway has arrived with Torres and Tuvok.) <br>
JANEWAY: Life signs. <br>
EMH: Apparently so. But before I could analyse them, the life signs
simply ceased. <br>
TORRES: I'm scanning the remains on all biospectral frequencies. It's
completely inert. Dead. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, somehow I find it hard to believe this rock suddenly
came to life for several seconds. <br>
TUVOK: I concur. However, dead or alive, these are the remains of an
alien entity we never fully understood. It may be prudent to place it
in a level three biohazard containment field. <br>
JANEWAY: Agreed. But first I want to take a look at <br>
(The remains start vibrating again.) <br>
TORRES: I'm picking up life signs. They're sporocystian. <br>
JANEWAY: The Caretaker was a sporocystian life form. <br>
TORRES: But according to my readings, the life signs aren't coming from
the remains. The remains are simply resonating in response to an
external energy source. Some other lifeform. <br>
EMH: Where? <br>
JANEWAY: Let's find out. Janeway to Bridge. Mister Kim, begin scans for
a sporocystian life form. </font></p>

TORRES: The lifesigns are gone. <br>
JANEWAY: These remains could be responding to the Caretaker's mate. <br>
TORRES: If that's true, maybe we could use them to track her down. <br>
TUVOK: And if we can find her she might have the ability to send us
home. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Keep us appraised. Janeway out. <br>
TUVOK: Captain, the Caretaker was a being of considerable power, and
although his intent was not hostile, we were essentially at his mercy.
I do not care to repeat that experience.<br>
JANEWAY: And if we are about to meet his mate, you'd like it to be on
more even ground.<br>
TUVOK: Precisely. I have studied the Doctor's biochemical analysis of
the Caretaker remains and I believe it is possible to create a
sporocystian toxin, something which might debilitate the life form. <br>
JANEWAY: Sounds like a sensible precaution. Get on it. <br>
PARIS: I'm picking up sporocystian energy. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Chakotay to Engineering. We're picking up life signs. Is your
compass working? <br>

PARIS: Aye, Captain. <br>
(Zoom.) <br>
PARIS: Captain, we're picking up an artificial structure on long range
sensors. It appears to be a space station of some kind.<br>
JANEWAY: Slow to impulse and put it on screen. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That looks a lot like the Caretaker's array. <br>
KIM: The configuration is similar. So is the surface composition, but
it's only about one tenth the size. <br>
JANEWAY: Are there any sporocystian life forms on board? <br>
KIM: No, but I am picking up over two thousand carbon based life forms.
They appear to be. Wait a second. Confirming. Captain, they're Ocampa.<br>
PARIS: We're approaching the station, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: All stop. Hail them, Mister Tuvok.<br>
TUVOK: No response. I am reading an energy surge from the station,
possible weapons. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Shields! <br>
(Energy pulses, like the ones the Caretaker used to power the Ocampa's
underground habitat, fire at Voyager. Boom!) <br>
CHAKOTAY: Definitely weapons.<br>
KIM: Shields are holding.<br>
TUVOK: Incoming message from the array. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's hear it. <br>
(An Ocampa man appears on the viewscreen.) <br>
TANIS [on viewscreen]: You're not wanted here.<br>
JANEWAY: We pose no threat to you. I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway <br>
TANIS [on viewscreen]: You have been warned. <br>
(Later, Voyager is parked a little way off from the array.) <br>
KES: They are Ocampa? <br>
JANEWAY: That's right. There appears to be an entire colony. And
according to our sensors, the station is at least three hundred years
old. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Kes, is there any Ocampa history about people who left your
planet, or were captured by aliens and taken away? <br>
KES: No. The idea that there could be Ocampa anywhere but on the
homeworld is something no one ever considered. I thought I was the only
one. <br>
JANEWAY: Since you're definitely the only one on Voyager, I want you to
act as an intermediary. <br>
KES: Gladly. What should I do? <br>
JANEWAY: The first step is to arrange a meeting. Let's see if we can
get that far. Hail the array. <br>
(Tuvok obliges.) <br>
TANIS [on viewscreen]: This is becoming tiresome, Captain. If you force
us to take further aggressive action <br>
JANEWAY: I have someone here who wishes to speak with you. <br>
(Janeway steps aside to reveal Kes.) <br>
KES: My name is Kes. I'm an Ocampa.<br>
TANIS [on viewscreen]: This is some kind of trick. <br>
KES: I assure you, it's not a trick. <br>
TANIS [on viewscreen]: What would an Ocampa be doing on an alien
starship? <br>
KES: It's a long story. But I'd like to know what an Ocampa is doing on
an alien space station. <br>
TANIS [on viewscreen]: That is also a long story. <br>
KES: Then I suggest we meet and tell each other our stories. May we
come aboard your station? <br>
TANIS [on viewscreen]: No. But I'm willing to come to your ship. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Our readings indicated a sporocystian life form in this area.
We've been looking for that life form for months. <br>
OCAMPA: Why? To destroy it? <br>
JANEWAY: No, on the contrary. We believe it has the technology that
could send us home. <br>
TANIS: Captain, are you aware of how your ship is regarded? That when
Voyager appears people fear destruction. <br>
OCAMPA: Your ship is known as a ship of death. <br>
JANEWAY: What? <br>
TANIS: You've established quite a reputation. You killed the Caretaker,
declared war on the Kazon, raided planets for their resources <br>
CHAKOTAY: None of that is true. We never attacked anyone except in self
defence. <br>
TUVOK: And we did not kill the Caretaker. He died of natural causes. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Tanis, please try to understand. We only want to find
the entity we've been looking for. <br>
TANIS [telepathically]: I want to talk to you alone. <br>
JANEWAY: Our sensors tell us she is somewhere in this region. Can you
help us help us find her? <br>
KES: Captain, I'd like to speak to Tanis alone, if I may. <br>
JANEWAY: Very well. <br>
(Janeway, Tuvok and the other Ocampa leave.) <br>
TANIS: Why should I believe any of this? <br>
KES: These are kind people, Tanis. They saved my life at great risk to
themselves when they didn't have to. They wouldn't lie to you. <br>
TANIS: I will admit these people are hardly what I expected. But more
unexpected was finding you here, Kes. I had no idea any Ocampa had left
the homeworld so recently. <br>
KES: I have about a thousand questions to ask you. <br>
TANIS: I know. And I'm going to try to answer them. Is this where you
spend your time? <br>
KES: You mean in this room? No. This is where the Bridge officers
usually meet. <br>
TANIS: I want to see where you live. I want to see the place that is
special to you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Airponics]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TANIS:
You did all this?<br>
KES: I had a little help, but yes, most of it is my work.<br>
TANIS: You've done well. Bringing something so beautiful into a place
so sterile.<br>
KES: Sterile? Voyager? <br>
TANIS: Look around you, Kes. This is a cold and barren place.<br>
KES: There are over one hundred and fifty people on board. I'd hardly
call that barren. <br>
TANIS: There are people, but there's so little life here. Part of me
weeps to see you in this place. You're so isolated. Corridors,
bulkheads, all cutting you off from the world around you. <br>
KES: You live on a space station. How is it any different? <br>
TANIS: Oh, I assure you, it's very different. You're very young, aren't
you. <br>
KES: Two years. <br>
TANIS: Would it surprise you to know I am fourteen years old? <br>
KES: That's not possible! The oldest Ocampa only live to be nine. <br>
TANIS: You know so little about your own people. There's so much for
you to learn about yourself, about the galaxy. Being here on this ship
is holding you back. <br>
KES: These people are helping me. I'm a member of the crew. <br>
TANIS: I suppose we were like you once. Innocent, naïve. But when
Suspiria brought us here three hundred years ago, she began to teach us
how we could become stronger than we ever could have on the homeworld. <br>
KES: Suspiria. Is that your Caretaker? <br>
TANIS: We don't think of her as a Caretaker. Her species is actually
called the Nacene. <br>
KES: Then you do know her. Where is she? <br>
TANIS: Nearby. But she's so different from the entity you knew. He was
only interested in maintaining the status quo. He kept our people
servile and weak. Suspiria taught us to develop our psychokinetic
skills that had lain dormant for so long. We have abilities far beyond
anything you can imagine. <br>
KES: Like what? <br>
(The plants grow rapidly. Buds become blooms, seedlings fully grown
vegetables.) <br>
TANIS [telepathically]: We can enhance life. And that's only the
beginning, Kes. I have to return to the station. We'll talk again. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Ready
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Sounds like you've established a dialogue with Tanis. It's an
excellent beginning. Good work.<br>
KES: Thank you, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Kes, is there something wrong?<br>
KES: Not exactly. I'm just a little overwhelmed. I always believed that
my people had the potential to be more than what they were, that our
mental abilities could be somehow heightened. And now I've met someone
who's realised that potential, and I don't know whether to be excited
or frightened. <br>
TUVOK: A non-emotional response would be more useful. <br>
JANEWAY: But since you're not a Vulcan, I'd say a mixture of the two
emotions would be appropriate. It's an exciting moment, Kes, and I'm
very happy for you. But just remember, we know very little about these
Ocampa. Be cautious in your dealings with Tanis.<br>
KES: I will, but I just have a good feeling about him. </font></p>

potential. <br>

NEELIX: This is delicious. Mister Tanis, is it true you're fourteen
years old? <br>
TANIS: Yes, that's quite common with my people here. Suspiria helped us
develop a technology to extend the Ocampa life span three generations
ago. My father lived to be twenty years. <br>
NEELIX: Would that technology work for Kes? <br>
TANIS: Possibly. <br>
JANEWAY: Where does Suspiria live? On another array? <br>
TANIS: Oh, nothing so corporeal as that. She exists as pure
sporocystian energy. She only assumes physical form when we need to
communicate with her. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Does she occupy our space-time continuum? <br>
TANIS: I don't know. All I know is, when we need her, she comes. I'll
take you to the meeting place. I'm sure all your questions will be
answered then. You'll enjoy meeting her, Kes, as well as the other
Ocampa here. <br>
KES: I'd love to visit the station. <br>
TANIS: Visit? Why not stay with us? <br>
KES: Stay? <br>
TANIS: Yes. I think you could learn a lot from us, we from you. We
haven't been in contact with the Ocampa home world for hundreds of
years. we'd be fascinated to hear about our distant cousins. <br>
KES: That sounds wonderful, but <br>
JANEWAY: Kes, you certainly don't have to decide something this
important right now. Give it some thought. <br>
TANIS: She's absolutely right. There's no rush. <br>
KES: I appreciate that. I am curious about your mental abilities.
They're so much greater than mine. <br>
TUVOK: Do not underestimate your own potential, Kes. Your mental
abilities are rapidly maturing. <br>
TANIS: I might be able to help you. No offence to Mister Tuvok, but I
am more familiar with the Ocampa mind. <br>
KES: I would appreciate any insight you could give me. <br>

EMH [on monitor]: I ran a micro-cellular analysis of the Caretaker's
remains and discovered a critical enzyme in his cellular structure. <br>
TUVOK: The energy in this cylinder is formulated to break down that
enzyme. It would result in temporary paralysis. <br>

you have it? <br>

TANIS: No, you just tried to drink from it. And what would you do if
you wanted to take a drink? <br>
KES: I'd reach out and pick it up. <br>
TANIS: That's right. But you wouldn't be thinking about picking it up,
you'd simply do it, and that's what you just learned. Focus on the
goal, not the task. When you wanted the tea, it came to you. <br>
NEELIX: Ahem, excuse me. <br>
TANIS: We're not finished. I know you're tired, but I want you to try
one more thing. It's cold. Wouldn't it taste better if it were hot? See
past the liquid, not with your eyes, with your mind. What your eyes
show you is only the surface of reality. Look deeper. There is no
liquid, there is no cup. There is only a collection of molecules,
atoms, moving, vibrating. <br>
KES [telepathically]: I see them. They're barely moving. <br>

them up? <br>

TANIS [telepathically]: That's right. With the fire of your mind. <br>
KES [telepathically]: How do I do that? <br>

about creating a fire, just use it. <br>

you to the next level. Until then, goodnight. <br>

KES: If I can't control my abilities, there might be another accident. <br>
TANIS: I'm afraid it isn't going to get any easier, Kes. You're already
starting to manifest abilities far beyond anything you've ever
imagined. Soon you'll be so far beyond the other beings on this ship
that you'll look at them as they look at pets.<br>
KES: They're not pets. They're people, they're my friends. <br>
TANIS: And I'm sure you care for them very much. I'm sure they're
wonderful people. They certainly seem that way to me but, it's time
that you began to accept how different you are from them. The people on
this ship, they live their lives trapped inside their primitive skulls,
depending on flesh and bone to tell them what the universe is like.
They don't know what it is to see beyond the physical. Touch it. This
is how they know the universe. They touch the flower, their nerve
impulses travel up their arm to the brain, and in their mind they sense
the moisture of the petals, the texture of the leaves, the sharpness of
the thorns, and think they know what it feels like. But they don't. Now
touch it. Reach out with your thoughts. Feel it for the very first
time. Think of nothing but the flower. It's the only object in the
universe. Know it. Know it in a way only an Ocampa can. Can you see it?
<br>
KES: Yes. It's more than seeing. It's more than touching. I know this
flower. <br>
TANIS: You can do more. Reach out. Feel all the life in this room. <br>
KES: Yes, I can feel it. I know them all. They're so beautiful! <br>
TANIS: They can be more beautiful. Bring the fire! <br>
(Kes stands in a clear space, spreads her arms and moves the molecules
in the plants. She collapses in an image of flames.)<br>
TANIS: How did it feel? <br>
KES: They're dead. They're all dead. Amazing. <br>
TANIS: You felt life. You embraced its essence with your mind, and then
you transformed it. There's nothing else like it in the universe. <br>
KES: I killed those plants. Just like I almost killed Tuvok. But I
don't want to hurt anybody. <br>
TANIS: Of course you don't. That's not the point. Help people, hurt
them, give life, kill, it's all the same. Once you see beyond the
physical, you see the universe as it truly is. Now you know why you
can't stay with these people, why you have to come with me. Come back
to the station. We'll care for you. We'll train you. <br>
KES: Oh, I don't know. I still need some more time to think about it. <br>
TANIS: Take all the time you want. But when you meet Suspiria, I think
you'll decide to join us. <br>
KES: Why? <br>
TANIS: Because Suspiria is your future. She's part of us, and we're a
part of her. All the Ocampa here are connected in a way that can't be
put into words. And if you develop your abilities far enough, Suspiria
will invite you to go with her to Exotia. <br>
KES: Exotia? <br>
TANIS: A place the humanoids on this ship call a subspace layer. A
place of pure thought, pure energy. A place of the mind. Think about
it, Kes. When you're ready, Suspiria will embrace you. Goodnight. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Who are you? <br>
SUSPIRIA: Suspiria. <br>
JANEWAY: I've been looking forward to meeting you. <br>

galaxy. We're explorers too, but your friend brought us to this
quadrant against our will, and we haven't been able to find a way back.

JANEWAY: We didn't kill him. <br>
SUSPIRIA: You destroyed the Array and you took his remains. <br>
JANEWAY: I assure you <br>
SUSPIRIA: No! <br>

SUSPIRIA: You killed him, and now I will kill you. <br>

midair, bleeding. Then Janeway doubles over in pain.) <br>

Nothing! You have to trust. <br>

Suspiria. She collapses. Tuvok puts a forcefield around her.) <br>
SUSPIRIA: So, now you kill me as you did my mate. <br>
JANEWAY: No. I told you we didn't kill him. Please try to understand.
We don't want to hurt you. We don't want to hurt anyone. We just want

Captain's log, supplemental. We've resumed our course back to the Alpha

looked at the tea and I tried to make it boil, but nothing happened.
Without Tanis's help, I just can't do it.<br>
TUVOK: Nevertheless, your psychokinetic abilities are still a part of
you. They might resurface one day. <br>
KES: To be honest, I never want to see that part of myself again. <br>
TUVOK: To which part are you referring? <br>
KES: To the part of me which got pleasure from destroying those plants
in the Airponics bay. To the part of me that was tempted to go with
Tanis. I never realised I had such dark impulses. <br>
TUVOK: Without the darkness, how would we recognise the light? Do not
fear your negative thoughts. They are part of you. They are a part of
every living being, even Vulcans. <br>
KES: You?<br>
TUVOK: The Vulcan heart was forged out of barbarism and violence. We
learned to control it, but it is still part of us. To pretend it does
not exist is to create an opportunity for it to escape. Let us begin.
Open yourself to the impressions around you. The thoughts, the minds
that are on this ship. </font> </p>
