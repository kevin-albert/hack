and Cargo Bay two are still heavily Borgified. Seven of Nine has been
transferred from Sickbay to a regeneration unit. Janeway, the EMH and
Tuvok enter.) <br>
JANEWAY: So, how's the newest addition to our family? <br>
EMH: At the moment she's stable, but the prognosis isn't clear. Her
human physiology has begun to reassert itself. Respiratory system,
neurological functions, immune response. But those systems are swarming
with Borg implants. There's a battle being waged inside her body,
between the biological and the technological, and I'm not sure which is
going to win. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, it's time we brought her up to date. Wake her. <br>
SEVEN: Captain Janeway, What have you? The others. I can't hear the
others. The voices are gone. <br>
JANEWAY: We had to neutralise the neurotransceiver in your upper spinal
column. Your link to the Collective has been severed. <br>
SEVEN: You will return this drone to the Borg. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm afraid I can't do that <br>
SEVEN: You will return this drone to the Borg! <br>
JANEWAY: If I were to turn this ship around and head back into Borg
territory I'd be putting my crew at risk. I'm not prepared to do that.
Try to understand. You have to stay on board Voyager. But I'm offering
you freedom from the Collective, and I assure you we will do everything
we can to help the transition <br>
SEVEN: You will supply us with a subspace transmitter and leave us on
the nearest planet. The Borg will come for us. <br>
JANEWAY: It's too late for that. Your human cells are starting to
regenerate. You won't survive without medical care. <br>
SEVEN: We need nothing from you. We are Borg. We are - ah!<br>
EMH: This implant is being rejected by the tissue underneath. It's
going to have to be removed. <br>
SEVEN: You will suppress the human immune system. <br>
EMH: I'm sorry, but the process has gone too far. We've got to get you
to Sickbay. <br>
SEVEN: No! We are Borg! We are Borg! <br>
(Tuvok holds Seven while the EMH sedates her.)

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH:
This armour plating is anchored to the skull with over three million
microconnectors. There's no time to cut through them. I'm going to have
to remove the outer layer of the skull itself. Lieutenant, will you
please leave the surgical bay. <br>
TUVOK: This Borg is a security risk. <br>
EMH: She is heavily sedated. I assure you she's not going anywhere. <br>
(Tuvok steps back.) <br>
EMH: Thank you. Kes, I want you to anaesthetise her cranial nerves.
Twenty milligrams anetrazine. <br>
KES: Yes, Doctor. <br>
(The necessary hypo flies across from the trolley to her hand.) <br>
EMH: Kes? <br>
KES: I don't know what happened. I looked at the hypospray and it just
came to me. <br>
TUVOK: Have you been experimenting with your psychokinetic abilities? <br>
KES: No, not for months, but I have been feeling a little strange
lately. Lots of energy, sleeping less. <br>
EMH: I can see why. Your serotonin levels are sixty two percent above
normal. It's the telepathic centres of your brain. They're in a state
of hyperstimulation like they were a few days ago when you were in
contact with species 8472. <br>
TUVOK: Are they attempting to communicate with you again? <br>
KES: No. This time it's different. I don't feel their presence at all. <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps she's experiencing an after-effect of some kind. <br>
EMH: A reasonable diagnosis, for a security officer. I'll run a full
microsynaptic analysis, but it will have to wait. We should get back to
our Borg. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JANEWAY:
Come in. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Ship's status report. We've got two teams on the hull,
stripping off the Borg armour. They're working around the clock but
it's still slow going. <br>
JANEWAY: What about the warp drive? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Torres is having problems cleaning out the plasma relays.
It's disrupting the antimatter reaction. Until she's got it fixed we're
stuck at impulse. She's requesting all personnel with a level three
engineering rating or higher to lend a hand. <br>
JANEWAY: Granted. Tactical update? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Long range sensors are picking up residual transwarp
signatures, Borg vessels. They passed by probably three days ago. <br>
JANEWAY: So we're not out of the woods yet. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Having half our propulsion system overrun by Borg implants
doesn't make repairs any easier. <br>
JANEWAY: Seven of Nine could help with that. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That might be true if she were willing, but she's not in the
most cooperative mood. <br>
JANEWAY: That could change. I just have to reach her somehow. <br>
(She shows him what she has been reading - Registery Archive Personnel
Database.) <br>
JANEWAY: Annika Hansen. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Our Borg? <br>
JANEWAY: It took some digging through the Federation database, but I
managed to find a single entry in the records of Deep Space Four. Her
parents were unconventional. They fancied themselves explorers, but
wanted nothing to do with Starfleet or the Federation. Their names were
last recorded at a remote outpost in the Omega sector. They refused to
file a flight plan. Apparently, they aimed their small ship toward the
Delta Quadrant and were never heard from again. <br>
CHAKOTAY: For all we know, Annika and her parents were the first humans
the Borg ever assimilated. <br>
JANEWAY: From what she's told me, that was almost twenty years ago. <br>
CHAKOTAY: So she was raised by the Borg. It's the only life she ever
really knew. If you were thinking of bringing her into the fold, that
might not be possible. <br>
JANEWAY: What's the alternative? Toss her back to the wolves? <br>
EMH [OC]: Sickbay to Captain Janeway. <br>
JANEWAY: What is it, Doctor? <br>
EMH [OC]: Could you come down here, Captain. We're having some
problems. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll be right there. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">EMH:
It's like peeling an onion. <br>
(He removes a skull implant.) <br>
EMH: Store it in a bio-stasis chamber. It may still be active. If you
think there's a risk, Mister Tuvok, you can throw one of your little
forcefields around the chamber. <br>
TUVOK: A prudent security measure, for a doctor. <br>
(Janeway enters.) <br>
JANEWAY: Report. <br>
EMH: I'm afraid we have a decision to make. A difficult one. Her human
immune system has reasserted itself with a vengeance. Body armour, Borg
organelles, biosynthetic glands, they're all being rejected. Her life
is in danger. I have little recourse but to remove the Borg technology.
<br>
JANEWAY: Which is the last thing Seven of Nine would want. <br>
EMH: Hence the difficult decision. If a patient told me not to treat
them, even if the situation were life-threatening, I would be ethically
obligated to honour that request. <br>
JANEWAY: This is no ordinary patient. She may have been raised by Borg,
raised to think like a Borg, but she's with us now. And underneath all
that technology she is a human being, whether she's ready to accept
that or not. And until she is ready, someone has to make the decisions
for
her. Proceed with the surgery. <br>
EMH: Aye, Captain. <br>
(Janeway leaves.) <br>
EMH: Kes? Let's begin with the microtubular network embedded in the
oesophageal tract. <br>
(Seven starts fitting.) <br>
TUVOK: What's happening? <br>
EMH: I'm not sure. She's going into neural shock. I can't localise the
source. Kes, try to stabilise her motor cortex. Use a neurosequencer.
Kes, I said to stabilise her cortex or we're going to lose her. <br>
KES: Wait. I can see it. <br>
EMH: What? <br>
KES: I think the problem is in her colliculli. Yes, I can see it. A
Borg implant. It's pressing against her trochlear nerve. <br>
EMH: Can you tell me how we might remove it without severing the nerve?
<br>
KES: I think I can do more than tell you. <br>
(Kes' mind makes the tiny implant detach and dissolve. Seven stops
moving.) <br>
EMH: The implant is deteriorating. Her nervous system is stabilising.
Nice work, Kes. Unconventional but effective. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Medical
lab]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Later,
the EMH shows Janeway an artificial eye.) <br>
EMH: They say the eye is the window to the soul. In this case it's a
little bit more. I've fabricated this artificial organ to replace her
eyepiece, but I've had to retain some of the Borg circuitry along the
optic nerve. As a result, she'll have increased acuity in one eye. Note
how perfectly I've matched the pigment of the iris to her human eye. <br>
JANEWAY: Excellent work, Doctor. I admire your attention to detail.
When can I speak with her? <br>
EMH: She's out of immediate danger, and I don't plan to resume the
extraction process until tomorrow. I can wake her now, if you'd like. <br>
JANEWAY: I would. How are you, Kes? <br>
KES: I feel exhilarated, Captain. I've never been so focused in my
life, and my telepathic abilities are stronger than they've ever been. <br>
TUVOK: Your performance today was astonishing. However, your
psychokinetic powers are still undisciplined, and as a result,
unpredictable. <br>
KES: I feel like I'm in control. <br>
TUVOK: Nevertheless, you must proceed with caution. And with my
assistance. <br>
JANEWAY: What are you suggesting? <br>
TUVOK: A series of guided meditations to help her explore the depth of
these new abilities. <br>
JANEWAY: Kes? <br>
KES: I'm ready. <br>
TUVOK: Well then, if you'll excuse us, we should begin immediately. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Seven's
skin is now pink.) <br>
EMH: Ready when you are, Captain. <br>
(He wakes Seven.) <br>
EMH: Don't be alarmed. You're in Sickbay. You're going to be fine. <br>
SEVEN: What have you done to me! <br>
EMH: Your body was rejecting the Borg technology. You were dying. I'm
sorry, but we had no choice. Those are dermoplastic grafts. They'll
help the regeneration process. <br>
SEVEN: Unacceptable. <br>
(Seven gets off the biobed.) <br>
SEVEN: You should have let us die. <br>
JANEWAY: I couldn't do that. <br>
SEVEN: This drone cannot survive outside the Collective. <br>
EMH: I beg to differ. Now that the Borg implants are being excised,
your human systems are free to thrive. And thriving they are. As a
matter of
fact, I <br>
(Janeway silences him with a Look. He walks away.) <br>
JANEWAY: I want to help you, but I need to understand what you're going
through. <br>
SEVEN: Do not engage us in superficial attempts at sympathy. <br>
JANEWAY: It's obvious that you're in pain. That you're frightened. That
you feel isolated. Alone. <br>
SEVEN: You are an individual. You are small. You cannot understand what
it is to be Borg. <br>
JANEWAY: No, but I can imagine. You were part of a vast consciousness,
billions of minds working together. A harmony of purpose and thought.
No indecision, no doubts. The security and strength of a unified will.
And you've lost that. <br>
SEVEN: This drone is small now. Alone. One voice, one mind. The silence
is unacceptable. We need the others! <br>
JANEWAY: I can't give you back to the Borg, but you're not alone.
You're part of a human community now. A human collective. We may be
individuals but we live and work together. You can have some of the
unity you require right here on Voyager. <br>
SEVEN: Insufficient. <br>
JANEWAY: It'll have to do. And the fact is, this community needs you.
The Borg modifications you made to our vessel are disrupting our warp
drive. We need your help to remove them, your expertise, your
cooperation. You must comply. </font></p>

All right, I think I've got all the Borg garbage out of the plasma
intake manifold. Let's try reinitialising the antimatter reaction. <br>
KIM: Matter antimatter reaction at twenty two cochranes and rising. <br>
(Then it stops again.) <br>
TORRES: Damn! What happened? <br>
KIM: Intake manifolds eleven and thirteen are still blocked. <br>
TORRES: This is like pulling weeds. You think you've got them all out
and then <br>
(Janeway and Seven enter.) <br>
SEVEN: You have neglected to remove the autonomous regeneration
sequencers. <br>
JANEWAY: Lieutenant Torres, Ensign Kim, you remember Seven of Nine. <br>
KIM: How could we forget? <br>
JANEWAY: We can't afford to delay repairs any longer, so I've asked her
to help us remove the Borg modifications. She only has a few hours
before she returns to Sickbay. I suggest you put here to good use. <br>
TORRES: You can start with the plasma relays. They're in Jefferies tube
thirteen. <br>
SEVEN: Jefferies tube thirteen alpha section twelve. We fully recall
the engineering specifications of your vessel. <br>
TORRES: Good. Can you also recall the way it looked before you turned
it into a Borg circus? <br>
SEVEN: Yes. <br>
JANEWAY: Well, now that the pleasantries are over, why don't you get to
work? I want updates every hour. <br>

The flame of the lamp is fire disciplined, tamed and under control. It
is the appropriate focus for the task ahead of us. <br>
KES: How do we begin? <br>
TUVOK: I will attempt to guide you in manipulating the flame at the
subatomic level. Concentrate on the flame. Try to see past the surface,
past the light, to the patterns of energy and matter. <br>
KES: I can see the essence of the fire. <br>
TUVOK: Good. Now reach out with your mind and intensify the flame. <br>
KES: I'm making it hotter, brighter. <br>
TUVOK: Now, with your thoughts, reduce the flame. Excellent. You never
demonstrated this level of control before. <br>
KES: It's as though I knew what had to be done. <br>
TUVOK: What's wrong? <br>
KES: Something's happening. I can see further, beyond the subatomic. <br>
TUVOK: Kes, there is nothing beyond the subatomic. <br>
KES: But I can see it, Tuvok. It's a new level of reality. It's
beautiful. <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps we should stop for now. <br>

SEVEN: Autonomous regeneration sequencers. They function to counteract

KIM: Amazing. How did you come up with the pattern duplication design? <br>
SEVEN: We came up with nothing. The Borg assimilated this technology in
Galactic Cluster three from species two five nine. <br>
TORRES: I'm not interested in a history lesson. How do we disable it? <br>
SEVEN: You must disconnect each sequencer conduit at the insertion
juncture. <br>

Stupid question. So, what's it like out there in Galactic Cluster

of it. Your attempt to assimilated this drone will fail. You can alter

easy for them to accept their individuality, but in time they did.
You're no different. Granted, you were assimilated at a very young age,

hypocritical, manipulative. We do not want to be what you are. Return
us to the Collective! <br>

another telepathic incident. Try to get some rest. <br>

the past few days. I miss you. <br>

Designations are no longer relevant. I am one. <br>
JANEWAY: Yes, you are. <br>
SEVEN: But I cannot function this way. Alone. <br>
JANEWAY: You're not alone. I'm willing to help you. <br>
SEVEN: If that's true, you won't do this to me. Take me back to my own
kind. <br>
JANEWAY: You are with your own kind. Humans. <br>

human. <br>(Janeway picks up a PADD and lowers the forcefield.) &lt;br&gt;<br>SEVEN: What are you doing? <br>

JANEWAY: I don't think you will.<br>(Janeway enters the cell, staying out of arms reach. She shows Seven the picture from the Personnel File on the PADD.)<br>JANEWAY:&nbsp; Do you remember her? Her name was
Annika Hansen. She was born on stardate 25479 at the Tendara Colony.
There's still a lot we don't know about her. Did she have any siblings?
Who were her friends? Where did she go to school? What was her
favourite colour?&nbsp;<br>(Seven looks at the picture for a while, then slaps it out of Janeway's hand.)<br>SEVEN: Irrelevant! Take me back to the Borg. <br>
JANEWAY: I can't do that. <br>
SEVEN: So quiet. One voice. <br>JANEWAY: One voice can be stronger than a thousand voices. Your mind is
independent now, with it's own unique identity. <br>
SEVEN: You are forcing that identity upon me. It's not mine. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh yes, it is. I'm just giving you back what was stolen from
you. The existence you were denied, the child who never had a chance. That life is yours to live now. <br>
SEVEN: Don't want that life. <br>
JANEWAY: It's what you are. Don't resist it. <br>SEVEN: No! <br>(She collapses into Janeway's arms. Janeway helps her back to the bunk and holds her.) </font></font></p>

Captain's log, supplemental. Warp drive is still offline and we don't
know whether the Borg have detected us. Kes' psychokinetic abilities
continue to damage the ship's structural integrity, and as a result our

Come in, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: You wanted to see me. Ah, Tuvok's meditation lamp. I was with
him when he got it six years ago, from a Vulcan master. Who doubled the
price when he saw our Starfleet insignias. <br>
KES: I'm sure it was the logical thing to do. I've been thinking about
everything that's been going on, and I know what I have to do. It's time
for me to leave Voyager. <br>
JANEWAY: Oh, Kes. <br>
KES: Something important is happening to me, and I want to explore it.
But I can't stay here any longer. I'm a danger to all of you. <br>
JANEWAY: We're going to get to the bottom of this. The Doctor's already
working on a new approach. <br>
KES: Everybody thinks that what's happening is a medical condition.
That's not it at all. I'm going though a transformation. I don't know
how or why, but every cell in my body is telling me that I'm changing
into something more. <br>
JANEWAY: What if it's not true? What if you're simply being swept up in
the excitement of something you think is happening, but it's not real?
On the basis of a feeling, an intuition, you're asking me to let you
go, quite likely for ever? Kes, I just can't do that. <br>
KES: It's my decision. My fate. Would you really try to stop me? <br>
JANEWAY: No. But argue with you? Even plead with you to reconsider? Absolutely, for as long as it takes. <br>
KES: It won't work. Look at me, Captain. I'm the same Kes you've always
known. I haven't lost my judgment. I'm not under some alien influence.
I believe something crucial is happening to me and I want to see it
through. <br>
JANEWAY: You've lived most of your life here. Voyager has been your
home. And you've been a vital part of this family. Oh, I'm going to miss
you. &nbsp;<br>(They hug.)<br>KES: Now all I have to do is tell the Doctor. He's not going to be
happy.<br>&nbsp;(Kes briefly becomes semi-transparent.)<br>KES: It's starting. <br>
