the Promenade. <br>
ODO: I find it odd that a conduit running behind Garak's shop should
just happen to overload. <br>
SISKO: Why would the Romulans want to destroy the Flaxian's ship? <br>
ODO: One possibility is that the Romulans hired the Flaxian to kill
Garak and then killed the Flaxian when he failed in his mission. <br>
SISKO: Do you know why the Romulans might hire someone to kill you? <br>
GARAK: I have no idea. <br>
INFORMANT: You are investigating a very insignificant piece of a much
larger puzzle. <br>
ODO: What do you mean? <br>
INFORMANT: There's been a great deal of unusual Romulan activity these
past weeks. <br>
ODO: Now, you dragged me into this investigation and you are now going
to cooperate with me. <br>
GARAK: Dragged you in? I don't know what you're talking <br>
ODO: You blew up your own shop, Garak! <br>
ODO: It's a Romulan warbird. <br>
GARAK: In Cardassian space? <br>
ODO: You're going to attack the Dominion, aren't you. You're going to
stage a first strike against them before they can come into the Alpha
Quadrant. <br>
TAIN: I'm asking you to serve Cardassia again, by my side. <br>
ODO: Garak, this is the man who put you into exile. This is the man who
just two days ago tried to have you killed. <br>
GARAK: Yes, he is. But it doesn't matter. I'm back. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(O'Brien is eating his soup heartily whilst Bashir
holds forth on a topic of 'conversation'.) <br>
BASHIR I mean, if you ask me, modern theatre has been on the decline
since the late twenty third century. Just look at the plays to have
come out of Earth in the last fifty years and compare them to the works
of Willemheld, or Barton or Chow-yun. <br>
(O'Brien points at something on Bashir's untouched plate.) <br>
BASHIR: Yes, yes. <br>
(O'Brien takes the bread and keeps eating.) <br>
BASHIR: Modern playwrights have become obsessed with writing human
interpretations of alien theatrical works while ignoring completely our
own unique cultural heritage in hopes of. Chief, are you listening to
me? <br>
O'BRIEN: What? <br>
BASHIR: I thought so. <br>
O'BRIEN: I heard every word you said. <br>
BASHIR: And what do you think? <br>
O'BRIEN: About what? <br>
BASHIR: Any of it. <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't know. Look, what do you want me to say? <br>
BASHIR: Say you agree. Say you disagree. Say you hate theatre. Just say
something. <br>
O'BRIEN: Look, Julian, you said you wanted to have lunch. We're having
lunch. <br>
BASHIR: Yes, but I was hoping for a little more conversation with my
plomeek soup. <br>
O'BRIEN: Ah. My mother taught me if you combine eating and talking,
you'll end up doing neither very well. <br>
BASHIR: Well, I suppose Garak taught me to think of lunch as a sort of
arena for philosophical debate. I take it there's still no word about
Garak and Odo? <br>
O'BRIEN: The starship Portland and a Cardassian cruiser are still
searching the Algira Sector for the runabout. That's not entirely bad
news. If the runabout had been destroyed they would have found debris
by now, or something to <br>
KIRA [OC]: Kira to O'Brien. <br>
O'BRIEN: Go ahead, Major. <br>
KIRA [OC]: Report to Ops, Chief. There's something here we'd like you
to take a look at. <br>
O'BRIEN: I'm on my way. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SISKO: About ten minutes ago, our sensors picked up
high concentrations of tetryon particles moving toward the station. <br>
DAX: I've never seen readings like these. What do you think? <br>
O'BRIEN: Subspace energy fluctuations, quantum fractures in the
electrodynamic field, EM spikes across the spectrum? You've got me. <br>
KIRA: Whatever it is, it's getting closer. <br>
DAX: And larger. The tetryon concentrations have increased ten percent
in the last thirty seconds. There's an energy surge bearing two one
zero mark three one five. A ship is decloaking. It's a Romulan warbird.
<br>
SISKO: Romulans? Open a channel <br>
DAX: Another warbird decloaking at zero one zero. No. It's a Cardassian
ship. <br>
KIRA: A Cardassian ship with a cloaking device? <br>
DAX: Definitely Cardassian, Keldon class. Benjamin, there's an entire
fleet decloaking out there. <br>
SISKO: Red alert. All hands to battle stations. Shields up, stand by
weapons. Try to hail them, Lieutenant. <br>
O'BRIEN: Their weapons are charged but they haven't locked onto us yet.
<br>
KIRA: The lead ship's heading for the wormhole, Commander. <br>
DAX: No response to our hails. <br>
KIRA: The fleet's following the lead ship. They're headed for the Gamma
Quadrant. <br>
SISKO: Lieutenant, open a priority channel to Starfleet Command now.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TAIN: you should have seen the look on Legate
Porania's face when I told him I was going into retirement three years
ago. He was literally speechless. A rare event. <br>
GARAK: I remember wanting to invent charges of treason against him just
so I wouldn't have to hear his voice again. <br>
TAIN: And you would have, too, if I hadn't held you back. You had quite
a vicious streak in those days. <br>
GARAK: Oh, I learned from the best. <br>
TAIN: No, no. You had a gift. I never met anyone else who relished a
good interrogation as much as you did. Do you remember getting that
confession out of Doctor Parmak? <br>
GARAK: I never even touched him. <br>
TAIN: That was the beauty of it. You just sat there for what, three
hours? <br>
GARAK: Four. <br>
TAIN: And after four hours of watching you stare at him, he confessed. <br>
GARAK: I was good, wasn't I? <br>
TAIN: You were brilliant. Afterwards, he just kept saying, 'His eyes
his eyes.' I've missed you, Elim. Things just haven't been the same
since you left. <br>
GARAK: I've missed you too, Enabran. <br>
TAIN: We're both getting sentimental in our old age. Next thing you
know, we'll be crying over our lost youth. <br>
GARAK: So whatever happened to Doctor Parmak? <br>
TAIN: He spent three years in a labour camp, then returned to Cardassia
Prime. I think he's practicing medicine again. When we get back, you
should look him up. <br>
GARAK: Oh, there are a number of people I intend to look up when we get
back. For instance, do you remember a Gul named Dukat? <br>
TAIN: Dukat? Oh, yes. The business with the arms merchant. I take it
you'd like to have him eliminated? <br>
GARAK: The thought had crossed my mind. <br>
TAIN: When this mission is completed, you'll be in a position to
eliminate anyone you want. <br>
GARAK: I'll make up a list and give it to Mila. <br>
TAIN: Perhaps you'd better give it to me personally. Mila may not be
around much longer. She knows a great deal about me. Too much for her
own good. <br>
GARAK: Still, it would be a shame to have her killed. She's proven that
she can be trusted on numerous occasions, and you'd be hard put to find
a better housekeeper. <br>
TAIN: Is this a request I hear? <br>
GARAK: Not at all. Just an observation. <br>
TAIN: No reason to pretend, Garak. You're fond of Mila. You don't want
her hurt, right? <br>
GARAK: If you're looking for an excuse to spare the life of your own
housekeeper, you don't need me to provide you with one. You can do it
out of the kindness of your heart. <br>
TAIN: Mila always believed you were innocent of betraying Cardassia,
and me. <br>
GARAK: I was. <br>
TAIN: Of course. (they drink) No wonder the Romulans can't conquered
the galaxy. No one can stomach their cuisine. <br>
(A Tal Shiar officer enters.) <br>
TAIN: Ah. Colonel Lovok. Allow me to introduce my associate, Elim
Garak. <br>
LOVOK: And what is his role to be in this operation? <br>
TAIN: He will do whatever I require of him. Elim is a cherished
colleague of long standing. <br>
LOVOK: You will not enter the bridge or any other secured space aboard
this ship unescorted. If you do so, you will be killed. <br>
GARAK: Direct, isn't he? <br>
TAIN: I'm afraid the Colonel believes in wasting little time with
pleasantries or idle conversation. <br>
LOVOK: The fleet has recloaked and is about to set course for the
Founders' homeworld at warp six. <br>
GARAK: Warp six? That's a bit slow, isn't it? Something wrong with your
engines? <br>
LOVOK: If we travel any faster, our warp signatures may be detected by
the Jem'Hadar, even through the cloaking devices. <br>
GARAK: Very clever. <br>
LOVOK: The changeling is in quarters on C deck. There are forcefields
in place to prevent his escape. <br>
TAIN: Good. Which brings us to your first assignment, Garak. I want you
to explain to Odo that it would be in everyone's best interest,
especially his, if he were to provide us with all the information he
has on his people. <br>
GARAK: That may prove difficult. He can be quite stubborn. <br>
TAIN: Then you'll have to find a way of convincing him.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GARAK: Well, Odo. I trust the accommodations meet
with your approval? You have to admit, it's certainly better than a
prison cell. <br>
ODO: There are forcefields around the bulkheads and a guard outside the
door. Feels like a prison cell to me. <br>
GARAK: I see your point. And believe me, if it were my decision, things
would be <br>
ODO: I don't believe you, Garak, and I doubt I'll believe much of what
you have to say from now on, so save us both some trouble and leave me
alone. <br>
GARAK: Why, Constable, you seem positively disappointed in me. Well, I
suppose it's understandable. After all, I did pledge my undying
devotion and eternal allegiance to both you and the Federation. And you
and I have been through so much together, shared many experiences, and
I know you considered me a close friend. No wonder you feel betrayed. <br>
ODO: You're wasting your time, Garak. I don't care about the
rationalisations you come up with to justify your actions. <br>
GARAK: Justify? I don't need to justify anything to you. <br>
ODO: Living on Deep Space Nine has made you a little rusty. Your lies
are becoming more transparent. You should be careful. You don't want
Tain to know that you're feeling guilty about what you've done. <br>
GARAK: You are imaginative, Constable, I'll grant you that. But I would
suggest that you put those creative powers to better use. We would like
you to share your unique insights on the Founders. <br>
ODO: Would you? <br>
GARAK: We would be grateful, most grateful, for any information you
could provide. <br>
ODO: And if I refuse? <br>
GARAK: Oh, really, Odo. You really must stop reading those human crime
novels Chief O'Brien gives you. It's poisoning your thinking. I'm not
here to threaten you. I just want to talk. <br>
ODO: I don't feel like talking. <br>
GARAK: Surely you can see that we share a common enemy, the Founders.
By cooperating, you'll be helping us provide security for the entire
Alpha Quadrant. <br>
ODO: The only common enemy you and I share is Enabran Tain. The
difference between you and I is that you don't know it. <br>
GARAK: I suggest that you think over what I've said, Constable. <br>
ODO: Funny. I was about to make the same suggestion.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Wardroom]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TAIN [on monitor]: Since the Jem'Hadar are
genetically addicted to a drug that only the Founders can provide, we
expect the Jem'Hadar to weaken and die once their supplies of the drug
run out. A matter of days by our estimates. However, that will give
them enough time to stage some kind of counterattack against the Alpha
Quadrant, so I suggest you place the Cardassian fleet on alert. I take
this action not in defiance of the Cardassian state, but in defence of
it. You in the Central Command have neglected the security of our
people and allowed peace with Bajor and the Federation to blind you to
the real threat, the Dominion. I intend to remove that threat. Let
history be my judge. <br>
TODDMAN [on monitor]: That message was intercepted by a Federation
outpost earlier today. A similar message was sent to the Romulan
Senate. Now, both governments are denying any prior knowledge of Tain's
plans and calling this a rogue operation. <br>
BASHIR: Are they going to do anything to stop Tain? <br>
TODDMAN [on monitor]: Both the Romulans and the Cardassians claim to be
studying ways to stop Tain, but we believe that they'll just sit back
and wait to see if he succeeds or not. <br>
DAX: But sir, that could plunge Romulus and Cardassia into war with the
Dominion. <br>
TODDMAN [on monitor]: Only if he fails, Lieutenant. His plan looks like
it has a fair chance of success. He's commanding a fleet of twenty
ships manned by combat veterans. They know the location of the
Founders' homeworld and they've modified their cloaks so the Jem'Hadar
can't detect their approach. <br>
KIRA: It sounds like you're hoping Tain will succeed. <br>
TODDMAN [on monitor]: I never hope for war, Major. But if it comes, I'd
rather see the Dominion on the losing side. However, we have to plan
for the worst. Ben, I want you to evacuate DS Nine of all non-essential
personnel and put the Defiant on standby alert. Even if Tain succeeds,
the Jem'Hadar are going to come screaming out of the wormhole looking
for revenge and they may not be too particular who their targets are. <br>
SISKO: Admiral, we believe Security Chief Odo is aboard one of the
Romulan ships. <br>
EDDINGTON: Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor
beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their
ships. <br>
SISKO: I'd like permission to take the Defiant into the Gamma Quadrant
and try to determine if he's still alive. <br>
TODDMAN [on monitor]: I'm sorry about your officer, but there's nothing
we can do. I want the Defiant guarding Bajor. That's your top priority.
Toddman out. <br>
(transmission ends) <br>
SISKO: Commander Eddington, am I correct in assuming that Starfleet is
planning to send substantial reinforcements to this sector? <br>
EDDINGTON: Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive
tomorrow. <br>
SISKO: Nine starships. I want the Defiant prepared to leave for the
Gamma Quadrant in two hours. <br>
EDDINGTON: Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and <br>
SISKO: I am not going to just abandon one of my officers. Toddman's
concerned about the defence of Bajor, and so am I. If we detect a
Jem'Hadar strike force heading for the Alpha Quadrant, we'll use the
communications relay to warn DS Nine, and we'll do everything we can to
stop them before they reach the wormhole. I consider this a volunteer
mission, but don't volunteer yet. There's a good chance you won't be
coming back from this mission. And even if you do, you'll probably be
facing a general court martial. If you do decide to go, be aboard the
Defiant at fifteen thirty hours. Dismissed.

EDDINGTON: The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have
been issued to every fire team. <br>
SISKO: Release docking clamps. <br>
KIRA: Commander, there's an incoming priority message from Starfleet
Command. It's Admiral Toddman. He's repeating his order not to enter
the Gamma Quadrant. <br>
SISKO: That's what you think it says. How can you be sure when a
transmission is as badly garbled as that one? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LOVOK: We know that the Founders' planet lies at
approximately these coordinates within the Omarion nebula. As you can
see, there are no Jem'Hadar bases nearby. This means that even if the
Founders did send out a distress call, it would take at least seven
hours for any help to arrive. <br>
TAIN: Our plan is to wait until we've entered orbit of the Founders'
planet, then decloak and begin massive bombardment. <br>
LOVOK: Computer analysis indicates that the planet's crust will be
destroyed within one hour, and the mantle within five. <br>
GARAK: That should more than take care of the Founders. <br>
TAIN: Yes, it should. Unless they have some planetary defences we don't
know about. There is one person here who might answer that question.
Mister Odo. <br>
GARAK: Anything he knows about the Founders and their planet was
undoubtedly included in his report to Starfleet. The constable is
remarkably thorough in these matters. <br>
TAIN: There was a time when you were eager to begin an interrogation,
Elim. In fact, I remember having to restrain your enthusiasm on several
occasions. <br>
GARAK: Then you should also remember the pride I took in my work. I
don't think that interrogating someone who can alter their form at will
is likely to provide either amusement or information. <br>
TAIN: I wouldn't worry about Mister Odo's shape-shifting if I were you.
The Obsidian Order has developed a device which should prove quite
effective in neutralising him. <br>
LOVOK: I was not informed about this device. <br>
TAIN: It's only a prototype. We've never had a chance to test it, until
now. Perhaps the Tal Shiar should take over the interrogation of the
changeling. <br>
GARAK: No. <br>
TAIN: It's all right, Garak. It's my fault. I should've known you'd
develop feelings for these people you've been living with for the past
few years. But I just never expected that you would become friends with
someone who worked for the Bajorans. <br>
GARAK: This has nothing to do with my friends or my feelings. I simply
don't believe he has the information you want. <br>
TAIN: Possibly. Colonel Lovok will find out. <br>
GARAK: No. I brought Odo here. He's my prisoner and my responsibility. <br>
TAIN: You don't have to do this. <br>
GARAK: Yes, I do. And I think we both know that you won't trust me
until I do. <br>
TAIN: All right. I look forward to hearing your results.

fluctuation in the cloaking device. <br>

getting worse. <br>

O'BRIEN: Everything looks fine. The power converters are online. The
projection matrix looks normal. The cloaking device should be working. <br>
KIRA: Maybe there's some kind of spatial anomaly nearby that's
interfering with the cloak's power systems. <br>
EDDINGTON: This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The
tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. <br>
KIRA: How do you know that? <br>
EDDINGTON: Because I sabotaged it. <br>
SISKO: Why? <br>
EDDINGTON: I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from
pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. <br>
O'BRIEN: You've turned us into sitting ducks for the Jem'Hadar! <br>
EDDINGTON: We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the
ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have
to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this.
Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he
gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. <br>
SISKO: I don't suppose you could. Chief, now that we know the problem
is in the tetryon compositor, how long until you can fix it? <br>
O'BRIEN: About ten hours. <br>
SISKO: You've got two. On your way. <br>

SISKO: I'm afraid I'm going to have to confine you to quarters, Mister
Eddington. <br>
EDDINGTON: Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to
need a chief security officer. <br>
KIRA: What makes you think we'll trust you again? <br>
EDDINGTON: Because I give you my word. <br>
SISKO: I make it a policy to never question the word of anyone who
wears that uniform. Don't make me change that policy. Man your station,
Commander. But I'd stay out of the Chief's way if I were you.

your arms and strangle me from across the room. But not this time. <br>
ODO: Oh? And why is that? <br>
GARAK: Because that device is emitting a quantum stasis field designed
to prevent any changeling from altering his biomolecular structure. <br>
(Odo checks this statement by flexing his hands and flinging them as if
they should stretch.) <br>
GARAK: Yes, it must be very disconcerting for you to be locked into a

SISKO: Major, leave the chief alone. <br>
KIRA: What makes you think I'm going to see O'Brien? <br>
(Sisko Looks at her.) <br>
KIRA: It's been three hours. I just wanted to see if he needed some
help. <br>
SISKO: If he needed help he would ask for it. For now, the best thing
we can do is to stay out of his way.

ODO: What's the matter, Garak? You don't look very happy. Aren't you
enjoying yourself? <br>
GARAK: There's no pleasure in this for me, Constable, I assure you. I
am simply doing my job. <br>
ODO: Your job. Yes, this is the job you've been waiting for. All these
years of exile and here you are interrogating a prisoner again. It must
fill you with pride. <br>
GARAK: Odo, just tell me what I need to know and this will end. <br>
ODO: But you don't want it to end, do you, Garak? Isn't this what
you've been dreaming of? Back at work serving Cardassia. <br>
GARAK: That's right. And you have information that I need. Information
that it's my duty to extract from you. It's not personal. Odo, talk to
me. Tell me something. Anything! Lie if you have to, but say it now.
Please. <br>
ODO: Home. I want to go home. <br>
GARAK: And you will, I promise. As soon as this is all over, I promise
I'll take you back to Deep Space Nine. <br>
ODO: No, not the station. Home with my people. <br>
GARAK: The Founders? You want to return to the Founders? I thought you
turned your back on them. <br>
ODO: I did, but they're still my people. I tried to deny it, I tried to
forget, but I can't. They're my people and I want to be with them in
the Great Link. <br>
GARAK: I knew there was something, a secret you were holding back. <br>
ODO: And now you've found it. I hope it's useful. <br>

all his little flakes joining him. Garak puts his head in his hands.)

GARAK: Nothing. He never broke. <br>
TAIN: Well, that's unfortunate. I see no further use for Mister Odo.
Terminate him. <br>
GARAK: On the other hand, he is a member of the Bajoran militia and an
officer on Deep Space Nine. We may not wish to provoke the Federation
by killing him. <br>
LOVOK: I agree with Garak. <br>
TAIN: Do you? <br>
LOVOK: Yes. There is no way to be certain that all of the Founders will
be on the planet when we attack. We should be prepared to encounter
other changelings in the future and we could use more information on
their capabilities. I want to take Odo back to Romulus for further
study. <br>
TAIN: All right, in the interest of cooperation. <br>
ROMULAN [OC]: Bridge to Colonel Lovok. <br>
LOVOK: This is Lovok. <br>
ROMULAN [OC]: We've entered the Omarion Nebula and dropped out of warp.
We should be in orbit of the planet in fifteen minutes. <br>

GARAK: Can I do something for you, Colonel? <br>
LOVOK: Why were you trying to protect the changeling? <br>
GARAK: I wasn't trying to protect him. And as I recall, you thought it
was a good idea to keep him alive as well. <br>
LOVOK: My interest in the changeling is based on what I believe to be
the strategic interests of the Romulan Empire. But you, you seem to
have a personal interest in him. <br>
GARAK: Tell me, what else am I feeling? I've never been psychoanalysed
by a Romulan before. This is a fascinating experience. <br>
LOVOK: You are a practiced liar, Mister Garak, but I am a practiced
observer. And I can assure you, I am going to be observing you very
closely.

TAIN: Signal the fleet to charge weapons and lock onto their targets.
We will open fire the moment we drop our cloaks. <br>
PILOT: All ships report ready. All weapons charged. <br>
TAIN: So much for the Dominion. Open fire. <br>
PILOT: The first barrage is complete. <br>
TAIN: Effect? <br>
PILOT: Thirty percent of the planetary crust destroyed on opening

TAIN: What? That's impossible. Some of them had to be killed. <br>
PILOT: Our sensor readings have been confirmed by three other warbirds.
There has been no change in the number of life-signs on the surface. <br>
GARAK: They're using an automated transponder to send back false sensor
readings. The planet's deserted. <br>
TAIN: Colonel, signal the fleet to <br>

LOVOK: What type of ships? <br>

PILOT: One hundred fifty. <br>
TAIN: Tactical display on screen. <br>
GARAK: It's a trap. They've been waiting for us all along. <br>
(Battle is joined. A Cardassian ship goes KaBOOM!) <br>
PILOT: Cardassian cruiser Koranak has been destroyed. Romulan warbirds
Makar and Belak have lost main power. <br>
LOVOK: Bring us about to three one eight mark two one five. Concentrate
fire on ships attacking on the port quarter. <br>
GARAK: The Jem'Hadar will destroy every ship if we stay. Our only hope
is to return to the Alpha Quadrant. <br>
LOVOK: There's no way out of here, Garak. The Jem'Hadar have cut us
off. We need to consolidate the fleet and make our stand here. <br>

GARAK: I'm afraid <a href="http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/julius_1_2.html">
the fault, dear Tain, is not in our stars but in
ourselves</a>. <br>

LOVOK: Bridge to Engineering. We need power to the weapons. Bridge to
Engineering, respond. I'll be in Engineering. Tain, take command of the

according to plan. <br>
GARAK: No, it's not, but I suggest we make our way to the runabout. <br>
ODO: For once, Garak, I agree with you. <br>
LOVOK: You will need this in order to gain access to your runabout. <br>
ODO: Why are you doing this? <br>
LOVOK: Because no changeling has ever harmed another. <br>
GARAK: You are one of the Founders? <br>
ODO: Of course. This whole plan was the Founders' idea in the first
place. You wanted the Tal Shiar and the Obsidian Order to combine
forces and come into the Gamma Quadrant so you could wipe them out. <br>
LOVOK: Not exactly. Tain originated the plan, and when we learned of it
we did everything we could to carry it forward. The Tal Shiar and the
Obsidian Order are both ruthless, efficient organisations. A definite
threat to us. <br>
ODO: But not after today. <br>
LOVOK: After today the only real threat to us from the Alpha Quadrant
are the Klingons and the Federation. And I doubt that either of them
will be a threat for much longer. It is not too late for you, Odo. Come
with me. You can still become one with the Great Link if you wish. <br>

have played it that way in the old days. In the old days I would've
