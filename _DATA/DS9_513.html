DAX: It looks like a Cardassian military code, but the computer doesn't
recognise it. <br>
GARAK: It was a call for help from Enabran Tain. <br>
WORF: We must warn the station. There is only one reason for the
Dominion to hide such a large fleet this close to the wormhole. <br>
GARAK: You think they're planning to attack the Alpha Quadrant? <br>
SISKO: There's no way we can beat the Dominion. Our only hope is to
prevent their fleet from entering the Alpha Quadrant. <br>
KIRA: You're going to destroy the wormhole? <br>
DUKAT: You have to trust me. Things are going to change on Cardassia. <br>
ZIYAL: What things? <br>
DUKAT: I don't have time to explain. You're leaving now. <br>
ZIYAL: I can't go. <br>
DUKAT: It's him, isn't it? That despicable tailor. You don't want to
leave because you're waiting for him? <br>
IKAT'IKA: This is Internment camp three seven one. You are here because
you are enemies of the Dominion. <br>
TAIN: You're not my son. <br>
GARAK: Father, you're dying. For once in your life, speak the truth. <br>
WORF: General Martok. <br>
MARTOK: The changeling that replaced me has caused the death of
countless Klingons. It is a grave dishonour. <br>

misunderstand me. I'm not attacking the Dominion fleet I'm joining it. <br>
KIRA: What are you talking about? <br>
DUKAT [on viewscreen]: I'm afraid I have a confession to make, Major.
For the past few months, I've been conducting secret negotiations
between the Dominion and Cardassia. And as of last week, Cardassia has
agreed to become part of the Dominion. <br>

ROMULAN: All clear. <br>
WORF: The transmitter Tain used to contact the station. Where is it? <br>
(Bashir gets a piece of metal from under Tain's bunk and uses it as a
key to open a lower section of the wall.) <br>
BASHIR: You have to crawl through that hole and kind of slide your way
up into the wall. <br>
MARTOK: It took him over a year to modify the old life-support system
into a transmitter. <br>
WORF: How did he operate it? <br>
MARTOK: He wired the message and the transmission coordinates directly
into the system circuitry. That way all he had to do was connect the
transmitter to the power grid and let it run. <br>
WORF: Could the coordinates and the message be changed? <br>
GARAK: You're planning to contact the runabout. <br>
WORF: We could activate the transporter and beam ourselves onto the
ship. <br>
BASHIR: And run like hell. <br>
GARAK: Re-encoding the transmitter won't be easy. We'd have to
reconfigure the array one circuit at a time. <br>
BASHIR: Can you do it? <br>
GARAK: Me? <br>
BASHIR: I'm no engineer and neither is Mister Worf here. You, on the
other hand, my dear Mister Garak, are a man of many hidden talents. If
you can't do it, nobody can. <br>

pleased to announce that the hostilities between our peoples have
ended. As of today, Cardassia has joined the Dominion. Therefore,
you're all being sent home. Congratulations on your new status as
Dominion citizens. Not you, Mister Garak. <br>
GARAK: Excuse me? <br>
DEYOS: You're staying. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DUKAT: (on viewscreen) You might ask, should we
fear joining the Dominion? And I answer you, not in the least. We
should embrace the opportunity. The Dominion recognises us for what we
are. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Wardroom]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DUKAT: (on monitor) The true leaders of the Alpha
Quadrant. And now that we are joined together, equal partners in all
endeavours, the only people with anything to fear will be our enemies.
My oldest son's birthday is in five days. To him and to Cardassians
everywhere, I make the following pledge. By the time his birthday
dawns, there will not be a single Klingon alive inside Cardassian
territory or a single Maquis colony left within our borders. Cardassia
will be made whole. All that we have lost will be ours again, and
anyone who stands in our way will be destroyed. This I vow with my
life's blood. For my son, for all our sons. <br>
DAX: Somebody tell me this is a bad dream. <br>
SISKO: It's no dream. <br>
KIRA: Well, I've got a vow to make too. Next time I see Dukat I'm going
to kill him. <br>
SISKO: Right now we have a more immediate concern. Such as who
sabotaged our graviton emitters? <br>
O'BRIEN: I don't know who it was, but they did a pretty thorough job.
The emitters had the exact opposite effect to what we'd intended. They
were supposed to collapse the wormhole's spatial matrix and close it
forever. Instead, they made the matrix even more stable. Not even
trilithium explosives could destroy it now. <br>
DAX: So the Dominion can send reinforcements through the wormhole
whenever they want. <br>
BASHIR 2: Looks like it's time for another round of blood screenings.
Obviously we have a changeling infiltrator on the station. <br>
DAX: What makes you think it's a changeling? <br>
BASHIR 2: That's who I'd send. <br>
KIRA: I think Julian's right. Odo tells me that a Bajoran maintenance
engineers has been missing ever since the Dominion fleet arrived in the
Alpha Quadrant. <br>
BASHIR 2: And if that was our changeling, he's either gone or assumed a
new identity. <br>
SISKO: We can't afford to take any chances. I want blood screenings and
phaser sweeps. If he's out there, we've got to find him. </font></p>

MARTOK: Your Federation friends have taught you modesty, but this is no
time for modesty. When we return to the Klingon Empire, I will seek out
Keedera himself and tell him of your glorious tale. He will write a
song worthy of you. <br>
BASHIR: Well, be sure to send me a copy. <br>
MARTOK: I'll do better than that. I can make sure that he mentions you,
the healer who bound the warrior's wounds so he could fight again. <br>
WORF: Right now, the only part of the song that I wish to hear is the
verse that tells of our escape. What good is defeating every Jem'Hadar
soldier in this compound if it does not bring us closer to our freedom?
<br>
BASHIR: We have to come up with a new escape plan. <br>
GARAK: That won't be necessary. The original one will work. I just have
to finish what I started. After all, a verse about the Cardassian who
panicked in the face of danger would ruin General Martok's song. <br>
MARTOK: And would be unfortunate. <br>
GARAK: Now, if you'll excuse me, my dungeon awaits. <br>
MARTOK: There is no greater enemy than one's own fears. <br>
WORF: It takes a brave man to face them.
