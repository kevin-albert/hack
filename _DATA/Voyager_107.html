through the osteographic series again. Just enter the responses you're

EMH: I asked the Captain for one. <br>
KES: Why don't you choose one yourself? <br>
EMH: Choose one myself? Me? Well, that just isn't. Holograms are
programmed, Kes. They don't choose anything for themselves. <br>
KES: Why not? <br>
EMH: Because we're not capable of choosing. <br>
KES: Well, you choose what medical treatment to give someone. <br>
EMH: I'm programmed with over five million possible treatments, with
contingency programs and adaptive programs. But it's all programs upon
programs upon programs. There's no independent decision making. <br>

so different from the way you access your programs? <br>

EMH: Certainly. I have the names of Starfleet doctors, their patients,

KES: So pick a name. <br>

KES: Pick a name you like, perhaps from someone who inspires you. <br>

JANEWAY: Do you have any idea who the victim was? <br>
KIM: An engineering physicist we were working with. His name was Tolen

we'd arrived. <br>
TOLEN: So, from the other side of the galaxy. <br>
KIM: Seventy thousand light years, give or take a few. <br>
TOLEN: That's a long trip home with a damaged collimator. <br>
KRAY: If anybody on this world can help you, Professor Ren can. He's
developed four generations of navigational arrays for our ships. <br>
TOLEN: We have to stay one step ahead of our neighbours the Numiri. Did
you bring your ship's specifications with you? <br>
KIM: It's all here. <br>
TOLEN: Splendid. Why don't we begin to look it over at my home this
evening? My wife would be delighted to have company for supper.<br>

better. That's better. What a good doggy. What a good doggy. Oh,
dearest, are you dressed? We have guests. I should have called. I just
don't think of the common courtesies. She's really wonderful about, er,
tolerating my dreadful manners. <br>
LIDELL: So, you've done it to me again. <br>
TOLEN: Yes, dear. I apologise. Oh, Lidell, this is Ensign Harry Kim and
Lieutenant Tom Paris. They're from the other side of the galaxy. <br>
LIDELL: Hello. <br>
PARIS: Nice to meet you. <br>
LIDELL: You might have called. <br>
TOLEN: You're absolutely right. Do you have enough to feed us all, or
shall we go out? <br>
LIDELL: No, it's fine. I have some leftover rolk from yesterday. I'll
just throw it in the stew. <br>
TOLEN: Wonderful. Gentlemen, make yourselves at home. I'm going to put
on my slippers. Lidell will take good care of you. <br>

KIM: Not the same thing that you're looking at, that's for sure. <br>

PARIS: What are you looking at? <br>
(Lidell enters and throws a piece of food onto the floor. The dog
pounces on it immediately.) <br>
LIDELL: If it's spoiled, Neeka wouldn't eat it. <br>
(Later, Tolen is serving the stew.) <br>
TOLEN: Nothing too fancy or exotic around here. We're very simple
folks. <br>
KIM: You're very kind to include us at your supper table. <br>
TOLEN: We enjoy an occasional guest. I think Lidell would prefer us to
entertain more often than we do, yes? She's far more social than I am.
I'm afraid she gets a little bored here sometimes. I'm so consumed with
my work. <br>
PARIS: And here we are bringing more of it home to take your husband's
attention away for the evening. <br>
LIDELL: Whether you are here or not makes no difference. Tolen would
work anyway. <br>
TOLEN: I'm afraid she's right. We are at war, after all. By the way,
how did you get past the Numiri patrols? <br>
KIM: Lieutenant Paris is our best pilot. <br>
PARIS: Captain Janeway decided not to take our ship into orbit. She
wanted to avoid getting involved in your conflict. So, we came in on a
shuttlecraft that would avoid immediate detection by the Numiri. I hid
behind the limb of the moon before I made a break for your defence
perimeter. By the time their sensors picked us up, they didn't have a
chance to catch us. <br>
TOLEN: Well done! Finished already? <br>
(Lidell leaves the table and puts her dish on the floor.) <br>
LIDELL: The meat doesn't taste right. <br>
(She leaves. Neeka eats the food happily.) <br>
TOLEN: Well, we do have a lot of work to get done. Perhaps we should
begin. <br>

navigational beam specifications. </font></p>

was pretty dry stuff. You know, rewriting baseline code algorithms. Tom
got bored. He left us alone for a while. I guess he was with Mrs Ren. I
know they saw each other again the next day. That was the night
Professor Ren was murdered. <br>
TUVOK: Did you talk to Lieutenant Paris after he was detained? <br>
KIM: No. They never let me see him. They interrogated me for almost two
days straight. They asked me a lot of questions about the Numiri. At
first, they must've thought we were Numiri agents or something.
Professor Ren was the inventor of Banean warship technology. <br>
EMH: He's completely exhausted. Can some of this wait until he's had a
chance to rest? <br>

NEELIX: You sent for me, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Lieutenant Paris has gotten himself into trouble. I'm taking
the ship into orbit while we try to sort things out. <br>
NEELIX: Be prepared to be intercepted by Numiri patrols. They always
try to intimidate travellers to the Banean planet. <br>
JANEWAY: The stakes are too high to send a shuttlecraft this time. I
want to show our flag to make it clear we mean business. <br>
NEELIX: I understand. <br>
JANEWAY: Based on your experience, what can we expect the Numiri to do
to intimidate us? <br>
NEELIX: To be honest, whenever I saw the Numiri coming, I always left
before the intimidation began. (laughs) However, I know from
knowledgeable sources that they have directed energy weapons comparable
to your own. Our own, that is. Plus regenerative shields that may even
give them a certain advantage over us in a firefight. <br>
JANEWAY: Tell me about them as a people. Are they aggressive,
technical, intellectual, emotional? Anything that might help me deal
with them. <br>
NEELIX: The Numiri and the Banea are quite different from one another,
even though they once coexisted on the same planet. That's why I
recommended the Banea to you in the first place. The Numiri have a
remarkably covert society. <br>

CHAKOTAY: We're scanning a Numiri vessel approaching. They're at combat
readiness, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Shields up. On screen. Mister Neelix. <br>
NEELIX: A standard patrol vessel. Curious. <br>
JANEWAY: Why? <br>
NEELIX: I would've expected them to send out more than one tiny patrol
to meet a ship like this. <br>
JANEWAY: Let's hope it's a positive sign. Hail them. <br>
TUVOK: They're responding. <br>
JANEWAY: Open a channel. I am Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Federation
Starship Voyager. <br>
(The Numiri are reptilian, while the Banea just have some feathers
growing amongst their hair.) <br>
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: What is your business in this system? <br>
JANEWAY: One of my crewmen is being held on the Banean planet. We're on
our way to investigate. <br>
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: Consider this official notice that you are
entering a war zone. You do so at your own risk. <br>
JANEWAY: Understood. <br>
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: Any attempt to provide aid or supplies to the
Banea will be considered an act of war against the Numiri. <br>
JANEWAY: You have my word that we intend to remain neutral in your
conflict. Our only interest is in our own crewman. <br>
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: Proceed. Your activities will be monitored. <br>
(Transmission ends.) <br>
NEELIX: Very, very curious. In Numiri terms, that greeting was
downright friendly. <br>
JANEWAY: Have all security stations remain at full alert. Continue long
range scans for Numiri patrols around the clock. <br>
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Take us into orbit. </font></p>

Kray's office]</b> </font></p>

KRAY: Captain. It's unfortunate we must meet under these circumstances.
<br>
JANEWAY: My chief of security, Lieutenant Tuvok. <br>
KRAY: Please. <br>
(They sit around his desk.) <br>
JANEWAY: Exactly what are these circumstances, Minister? All we know is
that a member of our crew has been accused of murder. <br>
KRAY: Oh, I'm afraid he's been more than just accused. He's been
convicted and punished according to our law. <br>
JANEWAY: What form of punishment? <br>
KRAY: The perpetrator of a murder is forced to relive the crime through
his victim's eyes. <br>
TUVOK: How is this achieved? <br>
KRAY: I can have our Chief Medical officer describe the procedure in
detail if you wish. We have the capability of isolating memory engrams
in the brain. We take them from the final moments of life. After
they're used in the trial, they're transplanted into the perpetrator's
brain. <br>
JANEWAY: These memories are used in the trial as evidence? <br>
KRAY: An artificial life form serves as host to the engrams and
testifies to their content. In this case, the victim's last memories
clearly show Mister Paris caught in an embarrassing episode with Mrs
Ren. An argument ensues. Paris is then seen by the victim's own eyes,
killing him. The evidence of his guilt is incontrovertible. </font></p>

PARIS: No! <br>
JANEWAY: But the victim's own eyes identified <br>
PARIS: You don't have to tell me what the victim's own eyes saw,
Captain. I don't understand it either, but I did not kill him. <br>
TUVOK: Were you having improper relations with his wife? <br>
PARIS: Their marriage was over. She told Ren they were finished the
same day he was killed. <br>
TUVOK: That does not answer my question. <br>
PARIS: Nothing happened between us. Almost nothing. <br>
JANEWAY: Tom, it's very important you tell us everything. Harry said
you spent some time with Mrs Ren while he and the professor were
working. <br>

together. </font></p>

atrium. Her eyes were a million kilometres away, staring at stars I'd
just flown by the day before. <br>

we finally got it into our heads it was killing us. <br>
LIDELL: You must be a very superior species. <br>
PARIS: That's not what I meant. <br>
LIDELL: Maybe I kill myself slowly because I don't have the courage to
do it quickly. <br>

LIDELL: Why don't you go ahead and ask me? <br>
PARIS: Ask you what? <br>
LIDELL: What you've been wanting to ask me all night. What they all
want to ask me. Why I'd marry a man old enough to be my father. <br>
PARIS: I'd be lying if I said I hadn't been wondering. <br>
LIDELL: He was good to me. A lot of other men weren't. <br>

TUVOK: Apparently, he's entering another cycle. <br>
(Paris seems himself stab Tolen, and collapses. Janeway fetches Kray
and the doctor.) <br>
JANEWAY: Is this normal? <br>
DOCTOR: We had some problems integrating the Banean engrams into his
alien neurology. This is the first time he's lost consciousness since
the implant. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd like to take him back with us to our medical facility. <br>
KRAY: I'm sorry, but I can't authorise that. <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps we should consider her request, Minister. We don't want
to risk general synaptic failure. Their doctors might be better suited
to stabilise his condition. <br>
KRAY: All right, but you're not to leave orbit with him. <br>
JANEWAY: Minister, we don't intend to leave orbit until we prove his
innocence. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
It's medicine clearly beyond anything we've ever encountered before.
What bothers me the most is the neural pathway damage it seems to be
causing. It appears to be progressive. <br>
JANEWAY: Then this punishment could actually be causing serious brain
damage. <br>
EMH: How long it might be before he's seriously affected, I really have
no idea. <br>
TUVOK: I would appreciate receiving a copy of your neurological
analysis, Doctor. <br>
EMH: It's extremely technical. To the layman, it would be virtually
indecipherable. <br>
TUVOK: Nevertheless, I will want to examine it in detail. <br>
JANEWAY: This might be the basis for an appeal of the sentence, don't
you think? <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps. However, before the neural implants were developed, the
Banean punishment for murder was lethal injection. It is possible they
would view that as the only alternative sentence in this case. <br>
KES: Will he regain consciousness? <br>
EMH: I believe so. But each time the cycle repeats, I'm afraid his
brain will take another damaging blow. <br>
TUVOK: When he wakes up, I will require an autonomic response analysis
while I question him again, Doctor. <br>
KES: Do you really think Tom would lie to us? <br>
TUVOK: As an investigator, I do not have the freedom to ignore any
possibility. Mister Paris maintains his innocence, yet the victim has
identified him from the grave, and the victim's wife has testified
against him at the trial. Someone is obviously lying. An ARA will tell
us if it is Mister Paris. <br>
EMH: I'll have it ready for you. <br>
TUVOK: In the meantime, Captain, I request permission to return to the
surface. <br>

TUVOK: Based on your testimony, I assume this is where the murder
occurred. <br>
LIDELL: Yes, right there. I had to have a professional cleaning crew
come in to remove the bloodstain. <br>
TUVOK: You chose to remain in the house after an act of such violence
occurred? <br>
LIDELL: This has been my home for over ten years, Mister Tuvok. Do you
really find that so hard to believe? <br>
TUVOK: I am a Vulcan, Mrs Ren. By nature, we are a dispassionate
people. It is rare to encounter someone as dispassionate as we are. <br>

argument from Tom Paris. Can I get you a drink? <br>

TUVOK: Please. You testified at the trial that you and your husband had
an argument the afternoon before he was killed. <br>

had to end a marriage? <br>
TUVOK: No. <br>

TUVOK: My wife and I have been married for sixty seven years. <br>
LIDELL: I'm sure she's a fine, dispassionate woman. I hope you never
have to find out for yourself, but I can tell you, ending a marriage,
it's a quiet thing. The arguments are long over and there's really
nothing much left to say at all. <br>
TUVOK: May I ask why you decided at this time to end your marriage to
Professor Ren? <br>
LIDELL: Because I was attracted to another man. I didn't want to
deceive my husband. <br>
TUVOK: That other man was Lieutenant Paris. Lieutenant Paris would have
been departing this planet in a few days, and yet you left your husband
of ten years for him. <br>

heart that it was time to start over. <br>
TUVOK: Exactly when did you see Mister Paris on the day of the murder? <br>
LIDELL: I went to see him at the Engineering Institute after I talked
with my husband. Once I was free, I knew he wanted to be with me. <br>
TUVOK: How did you know? <br>
LIDELL: A woman knows, Lieutenant. <br>
(Lidell's memory.) <br>
LIDELL [OC]: He left his friend Harry to finish the technical research
and walk me home. We were caught in a cloudburst on the way. <br>
LIDELL: I'm completely soaked! <br>
PARIS: There must be a centimetre of water in my boots. <br>
LIDELL: Here, let me help you. <br>
(Laughing, Lidell pulls of Paris' boots. Then she pulls him down to her
and they kiss.) <br>
PARIS: We shouldn't. <br>
LIDELL: It's okay. He knows it's over. <br>
PARIS: But you're still a married woman. <br>
LIDELL: I haven't been married for years, Tom. To him, I'm a friend, a
companion. He hasn't treated me like a woman since, it must've been the
day of the eclipse four years ago. <br>
PARIS: Eclipse? <br>
LIDELL: He was very excited by the eclipse. Don't ask me why. <br>
PARIS: Our timing's just a little off. <br>
LIDELL: You'll be gone in a few days. This is the only time we've got.
Let me make you something to warm you up. I love to drink Marob root
tea on rainy afternoons. <br>
(Back to now.) <br>
LIDELL: I made some tea, we talked for a while, then we went out to the
atrium to watch the storm and the rest you know. <br>
TUVOK: Did you leave the room at any time during the fight between your
husband and Lieutenant Paris? <br>
LIDELL: I saw Tom murder my husband, Mister Tuvok. I tried to stop him.
I couldn't. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Voyager to Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: This is Lieutenant Tuvok. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Mister Paris has regained consciousness. I thought you'd
want to know. <br>
TUVOK: Thank you. I'll be returning shortly. Tuvok out. Thank you for
your help, Mrs Ren. <br>
LIDELL: Lieutenant, when you see Tom, would you tell him that I forgive
him? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> PARIS:
Everything she told you is true, except I don't remember going into the
atrium or anything else after that. <br>
TUVOK: The last thing you remember is? <br>
PARIS: Sitting with her, drinking tea, talking about the sensual
effects of eclipses. After that, I must've fallen asleep. When I woke
up, I was in a cell. <br>
EMH: He's telling you the truth. <br>
TUVOK: Was there any evidence of a sedative in his system when he
returned here? <br>
EMH: The Banean medical authorities checked him. They didn't find any
drugs in his blood. Most narcotics would've been gone from his system
by the time he got to me. <br>
(Boom!) <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Chakotay to Tuvok. You're needed on the Bridge. We're
under attack by Numiri patrols. <br>
TUVOK: On my way, Commander. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Two
ships are attacking Voyager. Chakotay is at the helm.) <br>
JANEWAY: Evasive pattern, beta one four zero. Dual attack mode. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Evasive pattern confirmed. <br>
KIM: They're attempting to lock a tractor beam on us. <br>
NEELIX: That is a standard tactic for the Numiri when they intend to
board your vessel. Well, at least now you know I was telling the truth
about them, Captain. Although I take no pleasure in being right, mind
you. <br>
JANEWAY: But why now? Why an unprovoked attack? What are they after? <br>
NEELIX: The Numiri have never needed an excuse to attack anyone. <br>
KIM: Shields at ninety percent and holding. <br>
JANEWAY: Commander, prepare to initiate attack manoeuvre kappa zero one
zero. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Captain, if you don't mind, there's a Maquis trick we
sometimes used to get out of situations like this. <br>
JANEWAY: Be my guest. <br>
CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna. Remember Teluridian Four? The two Starfleet
runabouts? <br>
TORRES: I'm with you. Blowing out the dorsal phase emitters. Torres to
Engineering. <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: Go ahead. <br>
TORRES: Vent a couple of LN2 exhaust conduits along the dorsal
emitters. Make it look like we're in serious trouble. <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: Understood. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Cut all engines. <br>
TORRES: Engines off-line. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tuvok, lock phasers on their navigational deflectors. <br>
TUVOK: Acknowledged. Numiri ships are closing. Four thousand
kilometres. <br>
JANEWAY: Not to belittle Maquis tactics, Commander, but this is a very
old trick. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It worked against those Starfleet runabouts. <br>
JANEWAY: You're lucky I wasn't commanding one of them. <br>
TUVOK: Two thousand kilometres. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Besides, out here in the Delta quadrant, every old trick is
new again. <br>
TUVOK: One thousand five hundred kilometres. <br>
KIM: They're sending out tractor beams again. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's our cue. Fire phasers. Engage impulse engines. <br>
TUVOK: Both Numiri vessels are disabled, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: That's one trick you won't be able to use again when we get
back. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I have more. <br>
JANEWAY: Cancel red alert. Take us into high orbit. <br>
NEELIX: Captain. More Numiri will be coming, I promise you. <br>
JANEWAY: Mister Tuvok. Any progress with your investigation? <br>
TUVOK: Based on the ARA, I am convinced Lieutenant Paris believes what
he is saying. However, I can offer no tangible evidence on his behalf.
Considering the urgency of the situation, I believe the only logical
alternative at this time is to witness the crime myself. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Yourself? <br>
TUVOK: I propose a mind meld with Lieutenant Paris. <br>
NEELIX: A, a what? What, what did he say? A mind what? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
Let me tell you something, Lieutenant. Believe it or not, I know more
about mind melds than you do. I know what every Vulcan doctor has said
in every study of mind melds, and I still cannot tell you what will
happen if you do this. If these cycles cause damage to a human brain,
there's no telling what the risk might be to a Vulcan. <br>
TUVOK: I've examined your neurological reports, Doctor, and I believe
the risk is acceptable. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok <br>
TUVOK: Captain, the answers I seek can only be found in the eyes of the
murdered man. It may be our only chance to prove Lieutenant Paris
innocent. <br>
KES: Tom? <br>
(Paris is suffering. Janeway nods. Tuvok carefully lines up his fingers
on Paris' face.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Tolen's

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> LIDELL:
Tolen! <br>
TOLEN: Now I understand. <br>
PARIS: I'd better be on my way. <br>
LIDELL: You don't have to go, Tom. He's got no right. <br>
TOLEN: No right? This is my home. You come into my home and steal my
wife, and I have no right? <br>
PARIS: That's not the way it happened. <br>
TOLEN: We'll see what your captain has to say about this. When I'm
finished with you, you'll never wear that uniform again. <br>
PARIS: I can't let you do that. <br>
LIDELL: No, Tom, don't! Stop! No! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Tuvok
nearly collapses.) <br>
EMH: The cycle's ended. No neural damage that I can detect. <br>
TUVOK: Captain, I must consult with Ensign Kim immediately. <br>
JANEWAY: With Kim? Why? <br>
TUVOK: I assume he has access to Professor Ren's research. I believe it
will explain not only why Lieutenant Paris has been accused of a murder
he did not commit, but also why the Numiri chose to attack us. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Ready

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: His condition has continued to deteriorate. He'll have serious
brain damage if the implants are not removed. <br>
KRAY [on monitor]: We are not a barbaric people, Captain. This was
meant as punishment, not torture. I see no alternative but to remove
the implants, do you? <br>
DOCTOR [on monitor]: There is no legal precedent, of course, but we can
petition the courts immediately. <br>
KRAY [on monitor]: I cannot assure you'll find an alternative sentence
more to your liking. <br>
JANEWAY: We're still committed to proving his innocence, Minister. <br>
KRAY [on monitor]: When do you intend to return him to our custody? <br>
JANEWAY: Due to the nature of his condition, we're concerned that our
transporting device might cause further medical complications, so we're
sending him back by shuttlecraft. They'll leave this ship in one hour. <br>
DOCTOR [on monitor]: I'll make the necessary preparations. <br>

of shot.) </font></p>

This is all your fault, you know. <br>

PARIS: Yeah. I consider you the conscience I never had. You're supposed
to keep me on the straight and narrow. <br>
KIM: I tried to warn you. <br>
PARIS: Funny, so did she. <br>
KIM: If it had been me, I would've stayed as far away from her as
possible. <br>
PARIS: Someday it will be you, Harry. You'll meet her, and you'll know
it's wrong from the first moment you see her, and you'll know there's
nothing you can do about it. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: This is Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Federation Starship
Voyager. You have illegally seized one of our shuttlecraft. <br>
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: I warned you that you were entering a war zone
at your own risk. <br>
JANEWAY: Yes, we appreciated that warning and took appropriate
precautions. If you read the sensor readouts in front of you, you will
see that the shuttle is carrying forty tons of thalmerite explosives.
Enough to destroy your ship. I'm prepared to detonate those explosives
in thirty seconds if you do not release our vessel. End transmission. <br>
(Transmission ends. Paris and Kim enter.) <br>
CHAKOTAY: The shuttle's being released. The Numiri ship is withdrawing.
<br>
JANEWAY: Tractor the shuttle and take us into low orbit. Cancel red
alert. Mister Paris, how soon before your next cycle? <br>
PARIS: Seven hours. <br>
JANEWAY: That should be enough time to clear this up. Mister Tuvok,
this is your show now. <br>
TUVOK: With your permission, I would like to invite all interested
parties to meet at the scene of the murder in two hours. <br>
JANEWAY: I'll invite the Minister myself. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[The
Ren's home]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
Lieutenant Paris was not the man Professor Ren saw before he was
murdered. <br>
KRAY: Not the man? But it was clearly established at the trial. <br>
TUVOK: It is true, Paris's image was seen in the memories examined
during the trial. However, that is because someone altered the engrams
from Professor Ren's brain. <br>
DOCTOR: But that simply isn't possible for this procedure. <br>
TUVOK: I would suggest, sir, that there is no such thing as a
technology that is entirely safe from tampering. <br>
LIDELL: You're forgetting one thing. I was here and I saw him do it. <br>
TUVOK: On the contrary. I have not forgotten your statement, Mrs Ren.
However, I now know it is clearly false. <br>
PARIS: Just what was in that tea you gave me, Lidell? <br>
KRAY: Is this just idle speculation, or do you have some evidence? <br>
TUVOK: Mister Paris, would you please stand next to Mrs Ren? <br>
LIDELL: What for? <br>
TUVOK: If you wouldn't mind. The man Professor Ren observed with his
wife was virtually equal in height to her. Clearly, Lieutenant Paris is
several centimetres taller. <br>
LIDELL: How do you know what my husband saw? <br>
TUVOK: Vulcans have the ability to meld telepathically with another's
mind. I observed your husband's memories as Lieutenant Paris went
through a cycle. I watched as the killer stabbed Professor Ren right
here, through the intercostal space between the eighth and ninth right
ribs, the exact location of the Banean heart. The killer clearly knew
Banean anatomy. Lieutenant Paris did not. <br>
DOCTOR: Are we supposed to take your word for all of this? <br>
TUVOK: There is additional evidence. For example, we can now say for
certain that Professor Ren was murdered by a Numiri agent. <br>
KRAY: What? <br>
TUVOK: Lieutenant, did you notice the stream of symbols and numbers
that were superimposed on the images? <br>
PARIS: Symbols? Well, yeah, I guess I did. I didn't know what they
meant. I thought they were part of the procedure. <br>
TUVOK: In researching this procedure, I found no other reference to
this phenomenon. I have now confirmed that these symbols and numbers
were equations taken from Professor Ren's weapons research. Someone
intended them to be delivered to the Numiri. <br>
KRAY: You're saying somebody used his brain to send secret data to our
enemy? <br>
TUVOK: He was a logical courier. The Numiri agents knew he could leave
the planet's surface without raising suspicion. The Numiri made two
attempts to gain access to Mister Paris. They attacked just after he
returned to Voyager, and then again when he was in the shuttle. <br>
JANEWAY: Someone on the surface had to be informing the Numiri of
Lieutenant Paris's movements. <br>
KRAY: Do you know who did this? <br>
TUVOK: You knew when Mister Paris would be in transit, Minister. The
doctor is the one who encouraged you to release him to our custody. He
is also the one who performed the implant procedure. I know of no one
else who had the opportunity and knowledge to carry out this plan. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not going to listen to any of this. <br>
KRAY: I really would like you to listen, doctor. <br>
TUVOK: Would you please stand again, Mrs Ren? <br>
DOCTOR: So we're the same height. It proves nothing. I never saw this
woman prior to the death of her husband. I was never even in this house
before today. <br>
TUVOK: You forget the other witness who was here on the night of the
murder, Doctor. Would you mind asking her to come in? <br>
(The doctor opens the door indicated by Tuvok, and Neeka enters,
jumping on her hind legs around him.) <br>
TUVOK: It appears that you are no stranger to Neeka, doctor. <br>
LIDELL: He lied to me, Tom. No one was supposed to get hurt. You know I
could never do anything to hurt you. <br>
PARIS: Yeah, you could. <br>

Hall]</b> </font></p>

enters and goes to where Tuvok is sitting alone eating his meal whilst
reading a PADD.) <br>
PARIS: Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: Mister Paris. <br>
PARIS: There are some who'd say you risked my future on the eyewitness
identification of a dog. <br>
TUVOK: It seemed a necessary step to ensure a truthful resolution. <br>
PARIS: Well, I appreciate you sticking up for me. I owe you one. <br>
TUVOK: I conducted a criminal investigation. If you had been guilty, I
assure you I would have pursued the truth just as vigilantly. You have
no debt to me, Mister Paris. <br>
PARIS: How come I always see you down here eating alone, Lieutenant? <br>
TUVOK: I prefer to read rather than engage in, what do humans call it?
Short talk? <br>
