TORRES: I just thought I'd stop by and ask you why you didn't meet me
for breakfast. <br>
PARIS: Breakfast. What time is it? <br>
TORRES: Seven forty. <br>
PARIS: And we were supposed to meet at oh seven hundred. <br>
TORRES: I was there. Right after I got off the night shift. I waited,
and I waited, and I called you on the comm. <br>
PARIS: I, er, I didn't hear you. I was having this wild nightmare. I
was out like a light. I'm sorry. I'll get dressed right now. <br>
TORRES: You don't have time. You're due on the bridge at oh eight
hundred and I've got to get some sleep. <br>
PARIS: I hate this! We never see each other. <br>
TORRES: I'm off Friday night. <br>
PARIS: Great. Let's go skiing. How about Saint Moritz? <br>
TORRES: We went skiing last time. <br>
PARIS: And you loved it. You're getting really good, you know. <br>
TORRES: I just thought maybe we could run a programme where the wind
chill factor wasn't thirty below zero. Like Fiji, or Samoa. <br>
PARIS: There's nothing to do there. <br>
TORRES: And you can be warm while you're not doing it. <br>
PARIS: How about a compromise? Er, spring skiing in Chile? Much warmer.
<br>
TORRES: A compromise? How about Tahiti? <br>
PARIS: Tahiti. As long as I can go water-skiing, fine. <br>

JANEWAY: We seem to be a little short-handed today. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Tom and Harry are both late. I was going to give them another
five minutes but I'll call them now if you'd like.<br>
JANEWAY: That's all right. I'm a little late myself, aren't I. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I wasn't going to mention it. Burning the midnight oil?<br>
JANEWAY: Actually, I went to bed early for a change, but I had a
nightmare and I could not get back to sleep. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I had a bad dream last night, too. <br>
JANEWAY: You tell me yours and I'll tell you mine. <br>
PARIS: Sorry I'm late, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Well? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I was in the forest with my father. We were hunting deer,
which was odd because that was something I always refused to do. We
cornered the animal. I looked to my father to see if he was going to
kill it but he wasn't my father anymore. He was a vicious looking alien.<br>
JANEWAY: There was an alien in my dream, too. And it wasn't from any
race I've seen before. He had sharp ridges on his forehead and on the
front of his neck.<br>
CHAKOTAY: That's what mine looked like. <br>
PARIS: I don't mean to be eavesdropping but, I had a nightmare last
night too, and I'm pretty sure I saw the same guy.<br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok, by any chance did you have a bad dream last night? <br>
TUVOK: I did have a somewhat unsettling dream, yes. It involved a alien
with ridges on his face and neck. <br>
JANEWAY: I'd say this sounds like more than a coincidence. Let's get
the rest of the senior staff together and come up with some answers.
Which reminds me, where's Harry? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Bridge to Ensign Kim. <br>
JANEWAY: Computer, locate Ensign Kim. <br>
COMPUTER: Ensign Kim is in his quarters. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANEWAY: Deck six. I've got a hunch Harry's dreaming about our new
alien friend. <br>
TUVOK: That would be consistent with the experience the rest of us have
had. <br>
JANEWAY: Tell me more about your dream. Where exactly did you see the
alien?<br>
TUVOK: As a matter of fact it was here in the turbolift. <br>
JANEWAY: What happened? <br>
TUVOK: The alien simply stared at me as if scrutinising my appearance.<br>
JANEWAY: That's what happened in my dream. What did you do?<br>
TUVOK: I returned to my quarters. <br>
JANEWAY: Did the alien follow you?<br>
TUVOK: He did. <br>
JANEWAY: And then? <br>
TUVOK: He watched me. <br>
JANEWAY: Doing what? <br>
TUVOK: Getting dressed. <br>
JANEWAY: Getting dressed? <br>
TUVOK: Yes. <br>
JANEWAY: I don't suppose I should ask why you were undressed. <br>
TUVOK: I would prefer that you didn't. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Kim is not the only sound sleeper on board.)<br>JANEWAY: Are they comatose? <br>
EMH: Not exactly. They all appear to be in a hyper REM state. I've
tried every conventional method of waking them, from drugs to direct cortical
stimulation, but nothing works. <br>
JANEWAY: Do you have any idea what's causing this? <br>
EMH: Scans haven't detected any viral or bacterial agents. No cranial
trauma, no neural disorders. They're simply asleep.<br>
JANEWAY: I'd say it's a pretty good bet that this is somehow related to
the alien from our dreams. <br>
EMH: Any progress in identifying him? <br>
JANEWAY: Not yet, but I've got everyone working on it. In the meantime,
what's your recommendation?. <br>
EMH: Large doses of animazine. <br>
JANEWAY: I thought you said drugs weren't working. <br>
EMH: Not for them. For everybody else. Until I can determine what's
happening, I'd suggest the rest of you avoid going to sleep. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Briefing room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The e-fit of their suspect is in progress.)<br>PARIS:
I'd say his ridges were a little more pronounced. <br>
TORRES: Computer, increase facial ridge height by four centimetres. <br>
PARIS: That's closer.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I think his eyes were wider apart. <br>
TORRES: Computer, increase the space between the eyes by three
centimetres. Increase skin colour and texture. <br>
JANEWAY: That's him. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Has anybody seen this species before? While you were awake, I
mean. Seven? <br>
SEVEN: He doesn't resemble any species assimilated by the Borg. <br>
PARIS: So is he just a figment of our imagination? <br>
TORRES: If he is, we've all been imagining the exact same thing. <br>
TUVOK: One possible explanation is that he's attempting to make
telepathic contact. <br>
JANEWAY: He's doing more than making contact. We've got six crewmembers
who can't wake up. For all we know it's some sort of attack. <br>
SEVEN: From where? Astrometric scans haven't revealed any ships in this
vicinity, or planets capable of sustaining humanoid life. <br>
PARIS: So where do we look? <br>
CHAKOTAY: In our dreams. That's the only place any of us have seen him,
right? So if we want to communicate with him, find out what he wants,
we'll have to do it on his terms. <br>
TUVOK: How do you propose we do that? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Lucid dreaming. <br>
TORRES: What's that? <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's a technique which allows you to take control of your
dream. <br>
PARIS: That happened to me once. I dreamt I was falling and suddenly I
realised that I was dreaming, and I could fly, land, do whatever I
wanted. I was in complete control of the dream. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What happened to you by accident is something some people can
do by design. I've been able to have a lucid dream by using the same
technology I use for a vision quest. I may be able to use it to
communicate with this alien. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe so, but how do we know you'd be able to wake up again? <br>
CHAKOTAY: It's kind of like self-hypnosis. Before I go to sleep, I
choose a visual cue, something to let me know I'm dreaming. Earth's
moon, say. Once I see it, I can wake myself by tapping the back of my
hand three times. <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps you are capable of doing this under normal
circumstances, but these were hardly conventional dreams we
experienced. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't see any other way of finding out what our friend here
is after, or how we can wake up Harry and the others. Besides, we can't
stay awake forever. <br>
JANEWAY: You'll do this in Sickbay, under the Doctor's supervision. The
rest of you keep scanning the region. Analyse this ship from stem to
stern. Wherever he is, find him. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
Normally I consider a good night's sleep an important part of any
health regimen, but in this case, I can't recommend it.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I respect your medical opinion, Doctor, but at this point
we're out of options. <br>(The EMH puts a blinkie on Chakotay's forehead.)<br>
EMH: This will regulate your hypothalamus, but in all probability I
won't be able to wake you. You'll be on your own.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I understand. <br>
JANEWAY: Ready? Pleasant dreams. <br>(Chakotay activates his akoonah.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: Ah-koo-chee-moya. Far from the sacred places of my
grandfathers, far from the bones of my people, I seek to sleep, to meet
the one who has visited us in our dreams.<br>(Chakotay
finds himself walking along a corridor carrying a spear with a stone
tip. A deer crosses in front of him and runs into the mess hall.
Chakotay follows, spear ready to throw.)</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Mess
hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Earth's moon is visible through the
windows. The other doors open to reveal the deer, which then morphs
into the alien. He knocks the spear from Chakotay's hand and gets his
hands round his throat. Chakotay manages to push him off and pin his
arms.)<br>CHAKOTAY: I know this is a dream. My dream. I'm in control. <br>
DREAM ALIEN: You're mistaken. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Am I? <br>
DREAM ALIEN: This is more than a dream. It's my reality. And you're no
different than the others. <br>
CHAKOTAY: The others? <br>
DREAM ALIEN: The waking species. For centuries, you've come and found
us in a state that you call sleep and tried to destroy us. But not
anymore. Now we are in control. One by one, you will fall asleep and
enter our reality, where it is you who will be destroyed.<br>
CHAKOTAY: We didn't attack you. We didn't even know you existed until
we started seeing you in our dreams. Tell me how I can wake my crew and
I promise we'll leave. <br>
DREAM ALIEN: As long as you're asleep, you're no threat to us. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I can wake myself anytime I want. And if I do, I'm going to
start looking for you in the waking world. Find where you're sleeping.
You wouldn't want that. <br>
DREAM ALIEN: Leave our space. Once you're beyond it, your people will
awaken. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Just tell me how far we need to go. <br>
DREAM ALIEN: There's a six planet system less than a parsec away. It
marks the nearest border of our space.<br>
CHAKOTAY: We can be past it in one day. <br>
DREAM ALIEN: Then wake yourself, and pray you never dream of us again.<br>(Chakotay taps the back of his hand three times.) </font></p>

two. <br>
JANEWAY: Tom, lay in a course. <br>
PARIS: Aye, Captain. Course laid it. Do you mind if I ask where we're
heading? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Past the alien's territory. Once we're clear of it, Harry and
the others should wake up. <br>
PARIS: And the rest of us can finally get some sleep. <br>
JANEWAY: One step at a time, Tom. <br>
CHAKOTAY: From what the alien told me it sounds like they have
corporeal form but they communicate through their dreams. For them,
it's as real as the waking world. <br>
JANEWAY: Extraordinary. <br>
CHAKOTAY: It reminds me of the Australian aborigines. They believed the
dream world was no more or less real than the waking world. In fact, their
creation mythology says their ancestors actually dreamed the universe into
existence. <br>
JANEWAY: That's mythology. This seems to be fact. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I wonder, do they ever wake up? How did they evolve this way?
<br>
JANEWAY: We may never know. Sometimes first contact is last contact. <br>(Later -)<br>PARIS:

KIM: I don't understand. They exist in dreams and reality. <br>
TUVOK: Apparently, entering our dreams was their way to learn about us.
Perhaps to probe our weaknesses. <br>
PARIS: Not to mention lure us into an ambush. <br>
CHAKOTAY: We need to retake the ship. <br>
JANEWAY: That means getting out of this cargo bay. <br>
TORRES: I checked the Jefferies tubes. They're&nbsp;sealed. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe we can open them manually. <br>
CHAKOTAY: That's not going to be easy. They've got people everywhere. <br>
TUVOK: We'll have to create a diversion. <br>
JANEWAY: Any ideas? <br>
SEVEN: I have one, Captain. <br>(Seven grabs Kim and throws him to the deck.)<br>
KIM: What the hell are you doing? <br>
SEVEN: Creating a diversion. (loud) Ensign Kim, it is your fault we have been
captured. <br>(She pulls him to his feet and slaps him.) <br>SEVEN: (sotto) I suggest you fight back. <br>(Others try to pull them apart, half-heartedly.)<br>
JANEWAY: Tom, try to get into a Jefferies tube. You two work on the
power grid. I'll deal with this. <br>
DREAM ALIEN: Stop, stop. <br>
JANEWAY: What's going on here? These are my people, I'll handle them.
Ensign, that's enough. Move. (Chakotay and Torres open a panel and start work. Then Chakotay sees the Moon in the screen.)<br>
TORRES: What's wrong? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm still asleep. <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
Commander Chakotay, you're awake. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Am I? Are you sure? <br>
EMH: Of course you are. <br>(Chakotay goes to the consoles.)<br>EMH: What are you looking for?<br>
CHAKOTAY: The Moon.<br>
EMH: What? <br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't see it. <br>(He taps the back of his hand.)<br>JANEWAY: Where's the captain?<br>
EMH: Asleep, along with the rest of the crew. <br>
CHAKOTAY: All of them? <br>
EMH: Except me. No rest for the never weary. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What happened? <br>
EMH: As soon as you entered your lucid dream, they all began falling
asleep one by one. I've been trying every method I can think of to
revive them, but nothing works. It's been thirty nine hours. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I've been asleep for almost two days? <br>
EMH: If I can't wake them soon, I'm going to have to start feeding them
intravenously. <br>
CHAKOTAY: They let me think I was awake but I was still dreaming.<br>
EMH: You weren't the only one. Look at this. <br>
CHAKOTAY: What is it? <br>
EMH: A neurogenic field created by heightened electrical activity in
the brain. It's been occurring in all the sleeping crew members. And
that's not all. This is Ensign Kim's brain wave pattern, indicating
that he's dreaming in a hyper REM state. This is Crewman Foster's
pattern. <br>
CHAKOTAY: They're identical. <br>
EMH: Lieutenant Torres, Captain Janeway, Commander Tuvok. I don't know
what it means. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I think I do. Not only are they dreaming, they're all having
the same dream. It wasn't just my dream, it was a communal dream. <br>
EMH: Everyone's REM patterns are identical. They're experiencing the
same images, each from his or her own point of view. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Yes. I saw the rest of the crew, interacted with them. We
were all working together to fight off an alien attack. <br>
EMH: Which wasn't real. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Oh, we're under attack all right. <br>
EMH: Commander? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe this is the way these aliens fight their enemies. They
exist somewhere in our reality as physical beings, but they must be
asleep, unable to defend themselves against what they call waking
species. We'll never defeat them in their dream reality, but if we can
find them, find where they're sleeping, we'll have the advantage. <br>
EMH: But we've been scanning for lifeforms since this started and we
haven't found anything. <br>
CHAKOTAY: Maybe we've been looking in the wrong place. I'm betting a
species that spends its time sleeping isn't going to be hanging around
where conventional scans can locate them. <br>
EMH: So how do we find them? <br>
CHAKOTAY: This neurogenic field you mentioned. Anyone in a hyper REM
state would be producing one.<br>
EMH: In theory, yes. So if we scan for other neurogenic fields it might
lead us to the sleeping aliens. <br>
CHAKOTAY: If you need me, I'll be on the bridge. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Everyone else is sleeping at their stations.)<br>EMH:
Time for a little energy boost, Commander. We don't want you drifting
back to sleep. Sorry about the mess, but this is what happens when my
repeated requests for a larger Sickbay fall on deaf ears. What is it? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Scanners have detected a neurogenic field emanating from
beneath the surface of a planet less than a light year from here.
Excuse me, Tom, but I've got to change our course. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Sitting by the Borg alcoves, whispering.)<br>NEELIX:
Still dreaming? How is that possible? <br>
TORRES: I don't know, but that's what Chakotay said right before he
vanished. <br>
JANEWAY: That doesn't make any sense. He was wide awake, right here
with us. <br>
TORRES: He said something about still being asleep and then he started
tapping the back of his hand like he said he would to wake up from his
lucid dream. And then he disappeared. The question is, where did he go? <br>
KIM: The aliens must have transported him somewhere. <br>
TUVOK: Or perhaps he did wake up. <br>
TORRES: Tuvok? <br>
TUVOK: It's possible he was dreaming all of this. <br>
JANEWAY: Wait a minute. If Chakotay was dreaming and he woke up, what
are we doing here? <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps we're dreaming as well. <br>
TORRES: Now I'm lost. <br>
NEELIX: You're not the only one. <br>
TUVOK: Consider then, that we all experienced nightmares about an alien
whose people apparently live out their lives in a dream state. Perhaps
we're in that state at this very moment. <br>
KIM: That's ridiculous. We're not asleep. <br>JANEWAY: Wait.<br>
TUVOK: When you dream, you're rarely aware that you're sleeping. <br>
JANEWAY: I can understand how we can mistake dreaming for reality, but
that doesn't explain how we're all interacting with one another. <br>
NEELIX: Maybe we're not. <br>
TORRES: Not what? <br>
NEELIX: Interacting with one another. Maybe this is all one person's
dream, for example mine, and none of you are really here. <br>
TORRES: Trust me, Neelix. I wish I weren't, but I'm here. <br>
SEVEN: Collective unconsciousness. <br>
JANEWAY: Seven, come here. <br>
SEVEN: The Borg share a collective consciousness. These aliens may have
somehow inducted a state of collective unconsciousness. <br>
TORRES: You mean we're all sharing the same dream? <br>
TUVOK: It is possible. <br>
JANEWAY: This is all fascinating speculation, but unless we have proof
to the contrary we have to treat this like an invasion. <br>
PARIS: I managed to open a Jefferies tube hatch. <br>
JANEWAY: Good work. Neelix, Seven, Kim, do what you can to distract the
guards. We're going to find a way to retake the ship. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Looks like a complete power drain. <br>
TORRES: Their dampening field has shut down the warp core. <br>
TUVOK: Which begs the question of what they intend to do with an
unpowered ship. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok, grab some phaser rifles from the weapons locker.
Something tells me that when we try to disable the dampening field,
we're going to get the aliens attention. <br>
TORRES: It looks like they're using harmonic inversion technology. If I
can isolate the containment frequency, I may be able to get main power
back online. <br>(The warp core powers up.)<br>JANEWAY:&nbsp;That was easy. <br>
COMPUTER: Warning. Warp core breach in sixty seconds. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe a little too easy. <br>

JANEWAY: Can you eject the core? <br>
TORRES: I'm trying. It's not working. <br>

field around Engineering. <br>

TORRES: Got it! Let's move! <br>
JANEWAY: I don't understand why you couldn't eject the core. <br>

TUVOK: Captain, we must hurry. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm going back in there. <br>
TORRES: You'll be killed! <br>
JANEWAY: I think I'm on to something. You two go! <br>

COMPUTER: Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. <br>(Boom! The doors to main Engineering open.)<br>
JANEWAY: Either I've become impervious to antimatter explosions, or
we're still dreaming. <br>
TORRES: A warp core explosion should have destroyed the ship. <br>
JANEWAY: If I were awake, or if any of this were real, which it
obviously isn't. Things just weren't adding up. Chakotay's
disappearance. The warp core failing to eject. And as Chakotay said,
lucid dreaming is about taking control, so I took a chance. <br>
TUVOK: Surely there must have been a less extreme method of testing
your assumptions. As Captain, you shouldn't be taking chances with your
life.<br>
JANEWAY: I'm touched by your concern, Tuvok. <br>
TORRES: Now that we know this is a dream, what do we do? <br>

CHAKOTAY: No. <br>

EMH: He's paranoid, disoriented. I suspect much of the crew will suffer
similar symptoms when they awake. Try to relax, Commander. I'm going to
sedate you. <br>
CHAKOTAY: No. I need to wake, not sleep! <br>
EMH: I'm here to help you. <br>
CHAKOTAY: No! <br>(The EMH injects Chakotay.)<br>
EMH: It's all right, Commander. You're awake again. <br>(The planet is on the viewscreen.)<br>
CHAKOTAY: What happened? <br>
EMH: You dozed off.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I couldn't wake myself like I did before. <br>
EMH: Our proximity to the neurogenic field is making it more difficult
to stay conscious. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I need to get down there and find a way to neutralise it. <br>
EMH: Not so fast. This is a highly potent animazine derivative. If you
feel yourself falling asleep again, you must use it. And Commander, I
suggest we keep an open comm. line. I may need to provide you with a
verbal splash of cold water every now and then. </font></p>
