CHAKOTAY: Whatever she wants us for, it better be good. Bridge. I had
you right where I wanted you. <br>
TORRES: What are you talking about? I was ahead, nineteen seven.<br>

You wanted to see us, Captain?<br>
JANEWAY: Yes, Commander. We've picked up an intriguing transmission.<br>
TUVOK: I have a source on the signal.<br>
JANEWAY: A ship?<br>
TUVOK: Negative. It appears to be a beacon of some kind.<br>
CHAKOTAY: A beacon?<br>
TUVOK: We are being hailed by someone using a Federation signal.<br>
TORRES: How could someone be transmitting a Federation signal from the
Delta quadrant?<br>
PARIS: Maybe Starfleet found a way to get a probe here. Maybe they're
looking for us.<br>
JANEWAY: I'd like to believe that too, but let's not jump to
conclusions.<br>
CHAKOTAY: See if you can authenticate the signal.<br>
TUVOK: The carrier wave frequency does correspond to standard Starfleet
security codes.<br>
JANEWAY: As of when?<br>
TUVOK: According to the encryption key, this particular code was not
scheduled for implementation until stardate 48423.<br>
KIM: That's a month after we left Deep Space Nine. They must be looking
for us.<br>
JANEWAY: Your optimism may be premature, Mister Kim.<br>
KIM: Sorry, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: But it's also infectious. Mister Paris, lay in a course for
the beacon.<br>
PARIS: Yes, ma'am.<br>
(Later, at a purple nebula.) <br>
PARIS: We're approaching the beacon's coordinates, Captain.<br>
KIM: It's drifted inside an ionised hydrogen cloud. The cloud's
interfering with our sensor readings.<br>
JANEWAY: Can you get any information from the beacon?<br>
KIM: I'm afraid not. Should I beam it aboard?<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'd advise against bringing it on board before we've gotten a
look at it, even if it is emitting a Federation signal.<br>
JANEWAY: Agreed. And I don't want to fly blindly into a hydrogen cloud,
either. Mister Tuvok, tractor the probe into sensor range.<br>
TUVOK: Aye, Captain. Targeting scanners locked. Initiating tractor beam.<br>
(Boom!) <br>
JANEWAY: Report.<br>
TUVOK: We are taking fire from inside the cloud.<br>
JANEWAY: Source?<br>
TUVOK: Unknown.<br>
JANEWAY: Battle stations.<br>
TUVOK: A Kazon raider is closing at one five eight mark nine.<br>
JANEWAY: Hail them, Mister Kim.<br>
KIM: They're not responding, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Warp three, Mister Paris. Get us out of here.<br>
PARIS: Aye. (Boom!) Warp engines are offline, Captain.<br>
JANEWAY: Initiate evasive pattern omega three. Mister Tuvok, return
fire.<br>
TUVOK: Aye, Captain.<br>
KIM: Kazon ship is in pursuit.<br>
TUVOK: An opening is forming in the starboard shields, seventy two
centimetres in diameter.<br>
JANEWAY: See if you can close it, Commander. Try rotating the shield
harmonics.<br>
TUVOK: They are continuously matching their weapons frequency to our
shield frequency.<br>
JANEWAY: How the hell can they do that?<br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't know.<br>
TUVOK: The diameter of the opening has widened to approximately two
metres.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Set the shield harmonics to rotate continuously.<br>
TUVOK: Aye, Commander. Diameter of the opening is now approximately
four metres.<br>
CHAKOTAY: It's as if they know our access codes.<br>
TUVOK: Captain, I am picking up a smaller vessel emerging from the
hydrogen cloud. It is heading directly toward the opening in our
shields.<br>
JANEWAY: All hands, brace for impact.<br>
(The little vessel zooms straight for the place the bigger ship is
shooting at. Big bang!) <br>
COMPUTER: Warning. Hull breach on deck four, Cargo bay two.<br>
TUVOK: Structural integrity is at fifty percent and dropping. The hull
is starting to buckle.<br>
JANEWAY: We are losing life support on deck four.<br>
TUVOK: I am trying to initiate an emergency containment field. However,
the collision has caused a power failure on deck four.<br>
KIM: Rerouting power to compensate.<br>
TUVOK: Containment field activated.<br>

JANEWAY: Make it fast, Commander.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Engaging tractor beam. I've got them, Captain.<br>
KIM: The Kazon ship is hailing us.<br>
JANEWAY: Suddenly they want to talk. On screen.<br>
CULLUH [on viewscreen]: Captain Janeway, First Maje Culluh of the
Kazon-Nistrim.<br>
JANEWAY: I remember you, Culluh. That transporter module you just stole
was specifically designed for our ship. You'll never be able to
integrate it into your systems.<br>
CULLUH [on viewscreen]: I've had some help updating our technology
since we last met.<br>
(Culluh gestures, and a Cardassian woman steps into view.) <br>
JANEWAY: Seska.<br>
SESKA [on viewscreen]: That's right, Captain. As you can see, I'm in
the process of restoring my Cardassian physiology. Hello, Chakotay.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I should have known you were involved.<br>
SESKA [on viewscreen]: Yes, you should have. Just like I knew you'd try
to stop us with a tractor beam. You've always been so predictable.<br>
KIM: Captain, their deflector shields are creative a feedback loop.
It's neutralising the tractor emitter.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Attempting to compensate.<br>
SESKA [on viewscreen]: Goodbye, Chakotay. Lovely to see you again.<br>
KIM: It's too late. They've gone to warp.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Cargo

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Torres
climbs out of the Kazon shuttle.) <br>
TORRES: They modified the bow to puncture our hull.<br>
NEELIX: I've never seen the Kazon do anything like this before.<br>
TUVOK: Until now, the Kazon have never had an advisor with Cardassian,
Maquis and Starfleet tactical experience.<br>
KIM: The question is, how do we dislodge it without losing structural
integrity? With power down, our containment fields are already
extremely unstable.<br>
TORRES: We'll have to reroute additional power to the containment field
and tow their shuttle out with one of our own. Then we can repair the
breach. The shields and the warp drive will have to wait.<br>
JANEWAY: Warp drive isn't going to do us much good with this knife
stuck in our belly. Get it out fast. We don't want the Kazon to put too
much distance between us.<br>
NEELIX: Forgive me, Captain, but are you sure going after the Nistrim
is the wisest course of action after what they've already done to us?<br>
JANEWAY: Let me make something very clear. The Nistrim are in
possession of Federation technology. That is an unacceptable situation.<br>
NEELIX: Even though all they've stolen is a small computer component?<br>
JANEWAY: That small component has the potential to cause vast problems
in this quadrant. You're our resident expert on the Kazon. What do you
think the other sects will do when they realise the Nistrim have
transporter capabilities?<br>
NEELIX: They'll try to get it for themselves any way they can. You're
right. It could alter the balance of power among the sects.<br>
JANEWAY: Exactly. And it is our duty to do everything we can, no matter
how dangerous, to stop that from happening.<br>
NEELIX: You can count on me, Captain.<br>
CHAKOTAY: From the look of these sensor readings, Seska wants us to
come after her.<br>
JANEWAY: Commander.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I think Seska's leading us into another trap. She
masterminded a precision raid that made us look like first year Academy
students, but she left a warp trail for us to follow. After such a
flawless performance, why would she suddenly made that kind of mistake?<br>
JANEWAY: You think she wants more than the transporter. Are you
suggesting we don't follow her?<br>
CHAKOTAY: No, I agree with everything you said about preventing the
spread of our technology. But conventional tactics aren't going to work
with Seska. We'll need to come at her with a few surprises of our own.<br>
JANEWAY: I'm open to suggestions.<br>
TUVOK: Perhaps Commander Chakotay could use his intimate knowledge of
Seska to manipulate her in much the same way she manipulated us.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CULLUH:
It can move people great distances in the blink of an eye, Haron. But
this transporter is only the beginning. <br>
HARON: Go on, I'm listening.<br>
CULLUH: There is a ship filled with new technology. Devices that can
make food, water, even weapons appear out of thin air. A computer
system which uses neural tissue that can react twice as fast as ours.<br>
HARON: Very interesting, Culluh, but what does all this have to do with
me?<br>
CULLUH: That ship is on its way here. Help us and we can divide the
spoils.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">TORRES:
The module Seska stole contains a quantum resonance oscillator. So, we
modify this coil scanner to detect the oscillator, then we get close
enough to beam it back.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm betting Seska's figured out a way to shield the module
from our transporters. We might have to destroy it instead.<br>
TORRES: How do we do that?<br>
CHAKOTAY: We borrow a trick from Seska's book. Remember how we disabled
the computer core on the Cardassian frigate orbiting Bajor?<br>
TORRES: Seska modified an anti-proton beam to penetrate its shields and
hull.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Exactly.<br>
TORRES: But if I remember correctly, the beam was only effective from
an extremely close range. How do we get near enough to the Nistrim ship?<br>
CHAKOTAY: One thing at a time.<br>
TORRES: You're taking this all very personally, aren't you?<br>
CHAKOTAY: Why shouldn't I?<br>
TORRES: You're not responsible for what happened.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Oh no? I let her join the Maquis. I took her into my
confidence. I even got intimately involved with her.<br>
TORRES: So you have lousy taste in women. Look, Chakotay, she fooled us
all. She was my best friend. Or at least, that's what I thought.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Well, I for one, am through being manipulated by her.<br>
TORRES: Are you sure? Because she's affecting you. That's just where
she wants you. Don't tense up.<br>
CHAKOTAY: So now I'm getting advice about controlling my emotions from
you.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">HARON:
Our sects have been blood enemies for generations, and yet now you ask
for my help to defeat this Voyager. Why not simply do it yourselves?
I'll tell you why. Because the Nistrim are weak and the Relora are
strong. Your grandfather's time has passed, Culluh. You've presided
over the demise of your own sect, whittled away your strength <br>
CULLUH: Enough! You may have ships and soldiers, but I have the
technology.<br>
HARON: And I congratulate you on the daring and cunning of your raid.
Now, why don't you give me this transporter technology, assuming it's
authentic, and let the Relora do what we do best? When we have defeated
the Voyager, we will not forget the Nistrim's assistance.<br>
CULLUH: You think I'm a fool? I won't hand this technology over to you.<br>
HARON: Then perhaps we will have to take it.<br>
(The two Majes point weapons at each other.) <br>
SESKA: Why don't we let the Maje go back to his ship while we consider
his offer. <br>

into the Kazon's systems and started experimenting with it.<br>
EMH: Her early trials appear to have been less than successful. <br>
NEELIX: I'm not so sure these men died by accident, Captain. You see
this green band he's wearing? It means he was the First Maje of the

sect possesses. Join with him, or suffer the consequences.<br>
CULLUH: Maybe the mistake was to approach the Relora. They're already
strong. But the transporter may be enough to convince the Hobii to join
me. And perhaps the Mostral.<br>
SESKA: Yes. And with a few more ships, you can defeat Voyager. And when
you have the rest of their technology, the other sects will have no
choice but to fall into line. That's why I sent a subspace message to

than a little self-indulgent of Chakotay to assume this is all about
him.<br>

with her. And then he found out that everything he knew about her was a
lie. You said that he publicly defied your authority. Can you imagine
what it must have been like for someone as private as Chakotay to be
publicly humiliated by someone he loved? And then, as if that weren't
enough, she came back to taunt him in front of the entire Bridge crew.<br>

is, he's got a personal score to settle.<br>

taking responsibility. In his mind, he's trying to protect the rest of
us from a dangerous situation which he created.<br>
JANEWAY: Maybe. But that doesn't give him the privilege of ignoring
this ship's chain of command.<br>
TORRES: I know that. It's just that Chakotay would never tell you any
of this himself.<br>

sure I take his personal feelings into account before I decide how to
discipline him. <br>

activated, it means that I have destroyed the Nistrim's transporter

fortunate for you. Culluh wanted to execute you immediately, but I
convinced him that you'd be a valuable prisoner, and that I should be
the one to interrogate you.<br>

blood. It's not exactly fine cognac, but I've developed a taste for it.
Try some.<br>
CHAKOTAY: No, thanks.<br>
SESKA: You know, I've got to hand it to you. I thought all these months
answering to Janeway would have made you soft, but all you needed was a
little slap in the face to get that Maquis heart of yours beating
again. Here's to old times.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I have no interest in reminiscing with you. I destroyed the
transporter module. The game's over.<br>
SESKA: What do I need with a single transporter module when I've got
your shuttle and all its technology sitting in our hangar?<br>
CHAKOTAY: I think you'll find that technology useless. I wiped the
computer core before I transported.<br>
SESKA: I should have anticipated that.<br>
CHAKOTAY: So if you're going to have me killed, just do it. <br>
SESKA: You're still the noble one, aren't you? Ready to die for your
shipmates. You know, Chakotay, I may not have the transporter anymore,
but I've got something better. You. Maybe that's all I really wanted.
I've missed you.<br>
CHAKOTAY: You can't possibly believe that you and I could still <br>
SESKA: Don't flatter yourself. It was never that good. You might have
been an interesting diversion now and then, but I've always been less
interested in you than in the information you could provide me with.
First you gave me your Maquis secrets, and now I want Voyager's command
codes.<br>
CHAKOTAY: If you think I'm going to give you those codes, you don't
know me as well as you think you do.<br>
SESKA: Maybe not. But for old time's sake, I'll let you in on a little
secret. There are half a dozen ships from other Kazon sects on the way
here right now. They're joining us to help take Voyager.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Why are you telling me this? <br>
SESKA: I'm not a monster. I still care about Torres and some of the
others. I don't want to see anybody get hurt. I never did.<br>
CHAKOTAY: I'm touched.<br>
SESKA: These Kazon aren't as reasonable as you and I. I'm going to have
to use all of my influence to make sure they don't kill you all. But
you've got to give me something to work with.<br>
CHAKOTAY: Voyager's not coming. I left them explicit instructions not
to follow me, so you can stop worrying about people getting hurt.<br>
SESKA: They'll come. They'd never leave their First Officer in the
hands of the Kazon. You may not give me the command codes, but when

four light years. However, they are not alone. There are now at least
six other Kazon ships in the immediate vicinity.<br>
JANEWAY: I didn't think Culluh had that many ships.<br>
NEELIX: They must belong to enemy sects.<br>
TUVOK: That may be so, but the ships have not powered their weapons
systems.<br>
JANEWAY: What do you make of it, Neelix?<br>
NEELIX: It's certainly unusual for rival Kazon sects to congregate
peacefully.<br>
JANEWAY: Is it possible the Nistrim have formed an alliance with other
sects?<br>
NEELIX: I've never known the Kazon to do anything like that before.<br>
TUVOK: If the Nistrim have added six ships to their force, it would be
tactically unwise to engage them.<br>
JANEWAY: Then we'll just have to find a way of getting Chakotay out of
there without picking a fight.<br>
TORRES: We can transport him out.<br>
TUVOK: We would have to slow down once within transporter range, giving
the Kazon ample time to open fire.<br>
TORRES: Not necessarily. We could beam him out at warp speed without
even slowing down. The Kazon would never be able to catch us.<br>
KIM: That's difficult enough when both ships are travelling at warp.
The Kazon ship's not even moving.<br>
TORRES: I can compensate for that.<br>
JANEWAY: How?<br>
TORRES: By synchronising the transporter's annular confinement beam to
the warp core frequency.<br>
KIM: Maybe, but at a relative speed of two billion kilometers per
second, it's pretty tough to get a lock on somebody.<br>
TUVOK: Ensign Kim is correct. We would risk scrambling his transporter
signal and killing him. It would be a direct violation of Starfleet's
safety protocols.<br>
TORRES: Do you have a better idea? Trust me, Captain. I can do it.<br>
JANEWAY: How can you be so sure? <br>
TORRES: Because I've done it before. When you're a Maquis, you don't
always have the luxury of following protocols.
