SISKO [OC]: Sisko to Dax. <br>
DAX: Yes, Captain. <br>
SISKO [OC]: We arrive at Starbase three seven five in five minutes. <br>
DAX: I'll meet you in the transporter room. Dax out. Oh, now that's
what I call really bad timing. I have to go. <br>
WORF: Jadzia, there is just one more thing <br>
DAX: As long as it's not about the wedding. <br>
WORF: When we exchange vows, you must remember to present your d'k tahg
to General Martok as a formal request for him to accept you into our
House. <br>
DAX: But I don't want to join his House. <br>
WORF: What? <br>
DAX: I don't want to get caught up in all those blood feuds. Every time
a member of the House of Martok gets dishonoured or killed, I'll have
to drop whatever I'm doing and rush off on some quest for vengeance.
It's boring, Worf. <br>
WORF: If you refuse, it will be a grave dishonour. General Martok will
not understand. <br>
DAX: Worf, I'm joking. <br>
WORF: So you will join our House? <br>
DAX: Of course I will. <br>
WORF: I can see our lives together will not be easy. <br>
DAX: True. But they'll be fun.

Rotarran, requesting permission to dock. <br>
STARFLEET [OC]: General, you're cleared for docking at bay eleven. <br>
BASHIR: Thank God. <br>
O'BRIEN: I never thought I'd miss Starfleet field rations. Give me some
freeze-dried peaches, or some powdered carrots, anything so long as it
isn't moving. <br>
BASHIR: It's not the food, it's the singing. <br>
O'BRIEN: Till all hours of the night. <br>
BASHIR: If I'd have to listen to another ballad about the honoured
dead, I'll go stark raving mad. <br>
STARFLEET [OC]: Captain Sisko, Admiral Ross extends his compliments for
a job well done and requests that you and your senior staff beam to his
conference room for debriefing immediately. <br>
SISKO: Tell the Admiral we're on our way. <br>
STARFLEET [OC]: Starbase out. <br>
SISKO: Once again, thank you for rescuing us, General. <br>
MARTOK: Try not to get too comfortable lounging around the starbase. We
need you back in the fight. <br>
SISKO: Are you a betting man, General? <br>
MARTOK: One of my many pleasures. <br>

plate of fresh gagh. How many replacements? <br>
WORF: Five. <br>
MARTOK: Five? I requested fifteen. <br>
WORF: General Tanas could only give us five. <br>
MARTOK: We keep falling back. The Dominion keeps pushing forward. I
tell you, Worf, war is much more fun when you're winning. Defeats make
my wounds ache. Ah, the replacements. <br>
(Two teenagers, two women and a pensioner.) <br>
MARTOK: I am General Martok. Welcome to the Rotarran. May you prove
worthy of this ship and bring honour to her name. This is a glorious
moment in the history of the Empire, a chapter that will be written
with your blood. Fight well, and our people will sing your praises for
a thousand years. Fail, and there will be no more songs, no more
honour, no more Empire. Who among you hears the cry of the warrior
calling you to glory? <br>

WORF: Alexander. <br>
MARTOK: Rozhenko? Of what house is Rozhenko? <br>
ALEXANDER: Of no House, sir. My honour will be my own. <br>
MARTOK: Well, there will be plenty of honour for the taking on this
ship. Enough for all of you. I accept your lives into my hands. Glory
to you and to the Empire! <br>

KIRA: Talked her into it? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: You sent for me, General. <br>
MARTOK: Orders at last. We are to escort a convoy to Donatu Five. <br>
WORF: The last three convoys that were sent there were destroyed by the
Jem'Hadar. <br>
MARTOK: Which is why this one must get through. <br>
WORF: How many ships will form the escort? <br>
MARTOK: The Rotarran is all the High Council can spare. A vital
mission, impossible odds and a ruthless enemy. What more could we ask
for? I tell you Worf, I feel young again. Here is the briefing. Start
battle drills immediately. Train them hard. <br>
WORF: By the time we join the convoy, they will have the reflexes of a
Norpin falcon. <br>
MARTOK: I expect nothing less. Worf, one moment. <br>
MARTOK: We have shed blood together, escaped from a Jem'Hadar prison
together. You have pledged yourself and your life to my House. Yet in
all this time, you have never once mentioned that you had a son. <br>
WORF: It is a difficult subject to discuss. <br>
MARTOK: That much is obvious. <br>
WORF: Alexander and I were never close. His mother was only
half-Klingon and was disdainful of our ways. <br>
MARTOK: I see. So you allowed her to raise the boy. <br>
WORF: No, General. She was killed when he was very young. He spent a
short time with me aboard the Enterprise, but after that I sent him to
live with my foster parents on Earth. <br>
MARTOK: Why? <br>
WORF: He showed no interest in becoming a warrior. It was difficult,
but I learned to accept it and, in time, encouraged him to follow his
own path. <br>
MARTOK: Then why has he joined the Klingon Defence Forces? <br>
WORF: I do not know. I have not spoken with him. <br>
MARTOK: This is not good, my friend. When a father and son do not
speak, it means there's trouble between them. <br>
WORF: General, I prefer to handle this my own way. <br>
MARTOK: Then do so.

WORF: How are your grandparents? <br>
ALEXANDER: Your parents were in good health when I last saw them. <br>
WORF: Do they know you are here? <br>
ALEXANDER: They weren't pleased about my decision, but when they
realised I was determined to enlist they supported me as they always
have. <br>
WORF: I know we have not seen each other for some time, but let us talk
as father and son. <br>
ALEXANDER: I am not here to call you father. I am here to serve the
Empire. <br>
WORF: Serving the Empire was not one of your priorities when last we
spoke. <br>
ALEXANDER: As you say, that was some time ago. <br>
WORF: Did you think enlisting would please me? <br>
ALEXANDER: Pleasing you did not enter into my decision. With all due
respect, sir , does this conversation have any bearing on my duties
aboard this ship? <br>
WORF: Stop pretending to be a warrior. We both know you do not belong
here. You heard what I expect from the rest of the crew. Twice that I
expect from you. Do we understand each other? <br>

ZIYAL: Please don't be upset with me. I know how hard you worked to
arrange things for me on Bajor. I tried, I really tried. <br>
KIRA: I'm not upset with you. I'm a little confused. What happened? <br>
ZIYAL: It wasn't any one thing. The students at the university,
everybody was polite. But then I'd see them whispering in the hallways,
staring at me. I'm the daughter of Gul Dukat. My father is leading a
war against the Emissary of the Prophets. I don't know what made me
think I belonged there. This station is the closest thing I have to a
home. You're here. My father is here. <br>
KIRA: But the last time you defied him, he left you here to die. <br>
ZIYAL: We talked about that. He admits he overreacted, but family
loyalty is important to my father and he felt I betrayed him. <br>
KIRA: You betrayed him? I think it's the other way around. <br>
ZIYAL: He misses me, and I've missed him. I have to give him a chance.
He's all I have except for you. I was hoping you would have dinner with
us tonight because there's something special I wanted to share with
both of you. But I guess that's impossible. <br>

any fun. <br>

gift. The Institute is having an exhibition of new artists next month.
He might want to include my work. <br>
DUKAT: Wonderful! <br>
ZIYAL: It's a chance to show that both Bajorans and Cardassians look at
the universe the same way. That's what I want to do with my work, bring
people together. I guess it sounds a little silly. <br>

nothing breaks the tension better than a tankard of warnog. Except
maybe a good brawl. <br>

bones, but nothing more. You told me Alexander never wanted to be a

KIRA: The dress is fine. I don't like you. <br>
DUKAT: Major, that's just not true. There's a bond between us. <br>
KIRA: No. Only in your mind. You're an opportunistic, power hungry
dictator and I want nothing more to do with you. <br>
DUKAT: Ziyal would be very disappointed to hear you say that. <br>
KIRA: She'll get over it. <br>
DUKAT: Please, Nerys, let's sit down, We'll talk about it. <br>
KIRA: No, we won't. <br>
DUKAT: Nerys. Nerys! <br>
(Kira leaves and Ziyal come in from another room.) <br>
ZIYAL: Who was that? <br>
DUKAT: A delivery. It's a little something for you to wear to the party
tonight. Do you like it? <br>
ZIYAL: It's beautiful! You can be so thoughtful. <br>
DUKAT: I try.

to drop his bat'leth, when Martok enters.) <br>
MARTOK: Continue. <br>
(Alexander tries the 'passing from hand to hand' movement, and the
bat'leth goes flying again. Martok picks it up.) <br>
MARTOK: Fine blade, well balanced. But in the end, it is only as good
as the warrior who wields it. <br>
ALEXANDER: I need more practice. <br>
MARTOK: Tell me, Alexander Rozhenko. Why are you on my ship? <br>
ALEXANDER: To serve the Empire, General. <br>
MARTOK: That is a slogan, not an answer. Say what is in your heart. <br>
ALEXANDER: Do you ask every new crewman this question? <br>
MARTOK: I have no need to. I look in their faces and I know why they
are here. They are Klingon warriors. They have answered the call of
Kahless. <br>
ALEXANDER: Well, so have I. <br>
MARTOK: Lie to yourself if you must, but not to me. You do not hear the
warriors' call. I ask again, why are you here? <br>
ALEXANDER: I'd rather not say. <br>
MARTOK: What? <br>
ALEXANDER: It's a private matter. <br>
MARTOK: You're as tight lipped as your father. <br>
ALEXANDER: I am nothing like him. <br>
MARTOK: Both stubborn, tiresome qu'vatlh. The only difference is I need
him. I do not need you. <br>
ALEXANDER: All I ask is a chance to prove myself. <br>
MARTOK: I just gave you one and you failed. Your father has requested
that you be transferred off this ship. <br>
ALEXANDER: He has no right. <br>
MARTOK: He has every right, both as your superior officer and as your
father. At twenty three seventeen, you will transport to the cargo
vessel Par'tok. Collect your gear. Now.

Worf's plate.) <br>
WORF: You are fortunate that I am your father. If you had challenged
anyone else in that manner, you would be dead right now. <br>
ALEXANDER: If you want me off this ship you're going to have to kill
me. <br>
WORF: Alexander, I do not want to hurt you. I want to help you. <br>
ALEXANDER: By getting rid of me? All you've ever done my whole life is
send me away. <br>
WORF: I am a Klingon warrior. I lead a warrior's life. That is not the
path for you. You told me this yourself. And I have come to accept it. <br>
ALEXANDER: You call yourself my father but you haven't tried to see me
or talk to me in five years. I wasn't the kind of son you wanted so you
pretended that you had no son. You never accepted me. You abandoned me.

MARTOK: And the Jem'Hadar? <br>
ALEXANDER: Which one, sir? <br>
WORF: The one shooting at us! <br>
ALEXANDER: His aft shields are down to twenty-five, no twenty percent
and he's losing antiprotons from his starboard nacelle. <br>
MARTOK: Weapons, lock onto that nacelle. Fire at will. Full pattern. <br>
(Alexander's console blows up in his face. Ch'Targh looks shocked.) <br>
N'GAREN: We've lost target lock. Switching to manual. <br>
MARTOK: Helm, bring us to three one seven mark zero four five. Weapons,
can you hit him? <br>
N'GAREN: Negative. He's out of range. <br>

breach imminent. <br>
ALEXANDER: I can seal the leak. I'm of no use to you here. <br>

the injector before it explodes. <br>
WORF: Go. <br>
(Alexander and Ch'Targh leave.) <br>
MARTOK: Engineering, reroute all auxiliary power to the disrupters.
Disengage overload suppressor. Worf, put us off the Jem'Hadar's
starboard quarter. Weapons, continue to target his damaged nacelle. <br>
(Finally, the nacelle is blown off and KaBOOM!) <br>
MARTOK: Helm, on my command, reduce impulse power to one third. Bring
us to course three five five mark zero nine zero. Weapons, be ready for
him to pass in front of us. <br>
WORF: Course laid in. <br>
