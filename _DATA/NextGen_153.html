WORF [OC]: The archeologists have identified the markings in these
caverns. This planet was apparently once home to a race known as the
Koinonians. <br>
PICARD: What do we know about them, Data? <br>
DATA: The Koinonians were an intelligent culture which became embroiled
in a war that lasted for several generations. Our best evidence
indicates they destroyed themselves. <br>
WORF [OC]: We have completed our survey of the third tunnel and will
proceed into the ceremonial chamber. <br>
RIKER: Affirmative. Enterprise out. <br>
PICARD: Destroyed themselves, Data? <br>
DATA: According to historical records. This will be the first
opportunity for a Federation team <br>
TROI: Captain! Beam them up quickly! <br>
WORF [OC]: Captain. Emergency beam up! Enterprise, emergency! Severe
injuries. <br>

had indicated no weapons or traps of any kind. Lieutenant Aster was
three metres behind me. An explosive device went off. There was no
warning. Lieutenant Aster bore the full brunt of the detonation. <br>

TROI: Lieutenant Aster is survived by a son, Jeremy. Twelve years old.
He's aboard the Enterprise, sir. <br>
PICARD: And his father? <br>

Captain. <br>
PICARD: I really wonder. Halt. I've always believed that carrying
children on a starship is a very questionable policy.
Serving on a starship means accepting certain risks, certain dangers.
Did Jeremy Aster make that choice? <br>
TROI: Death and loss are an integral part of life everywhere. Leaving
him on Earth would not have protected him. <br>
PICARD: No, but Earth isn't likely to be ordered to the Neutral Zone,
or to repel a Romulan attack, It was my command which sent his mother
to her death. She understood her mission and my duty. Will he? <br>

Jeremy. <br>

know her? <br>
DATA: Why do you ask? <br>
RIKER: Well, you just asked me. <br>
DATA: But why do you ask the question? Since her death, I have been
asked several times to define how well I knew Lieutenant Aster. And I
heard you ask Wesley on the Bridge how well he knew Jeremy. Does the
question of familiarity have some bearing on death? <br>
RIKER: Do you remember how we all felt when Tasha died? <br>
DATA: I do not sense the same feelings of absence that I associate with
Lieutenant Yar, although I cannot say precisely why. <br>
RIKER: Just human nature, Data. <br>
DATA: Human nature, sir? <br>
RIKER: We feel a loss more intensely when it's a friend. <br>
DATA: But should not the feelings run as deep regardless of who has
died? <br>
RIKER: Maybe they should, Data. Maybe if we felt the loss of any life
as keenly as we felt the death of those close to us, human history
would be a lot less bloody. <br>

DATA: It comes from the time of the Koinonian Wars, sir. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WORF: I have made my report to the Captain. <br>
TROI: I'm more interested in how you feel about what happened. I sense
great anger. <br>
WORF: I cannot seek revenge against an enemy who's turned to dust
centuries ago. Her death was senseless. The last
victim of a forgotten war. <br>
TROI: Go on. <br>
WORF: There's nothing more to be said. <br>
TROI: A person died under your command. It may happen again. If you
can't learn to release the anger and the guilt, to talk about it <br>
WORF: A leader must stand alone. As Captain Picard does. <br>
TROI: Captain Picard talks to me. <br>
WORF: Then may I seek your counsel about my plan to make the R'uustai
with the boy. <br>
TROI: The Bonding. <br>
WORF: It is my right. <br>
TROI: It's very generous, Worf, but he's not a Klingon child. He has
different sensibilities. <br>
WORF: He is an orphan. I am an orphan. He will understand. <br>
TROI: Right now, there isn't much he can understand. He's holding all
his feelings inside. Children often feel they must be true to the
memory of a lost parent. If you offer affection to them too soon they
can feel guilty returning that affection. As if they're betraying the
love of the parent. <br>
WORF: I only wish to honour his mother. <br>
TROI: I know. And I understand this means a great deal to you. But you
must be prepared. He's very angry too, but his anger is deep inside
him. When he touches it, it will strike out in many directions,
including yours. Be with him. Talk to him. But don't rush this. When
he's ready, we'll know.

JEREMY: You're a Klingon, aren't you. <br>
WORF: Yes. <br>
JEREMY: We studied about Klingons in school. <br>
WORF: What did they teach you about us? <br>
JEREMY: You used to be our enemies. <br>
WORF: Did they also teach you that every Klingon hopes to die in the
line of duty as your mother did? In my tradition, we do not grieve the
loss of the body. We celebrate the releasing of the spirit. <br>
JEREMY: I understand death. They teach us all about it. <br>

meaning to your mother's death. Perhaps we can do it together.

how to express that anger before he can really say goodbye to his
mother. <br>
PICARD: How can we help? <br>
TROI: Well, I've asked Beverly if we might get Wesley to talk to Jeremy
about his father's death. The one unusual element is Worf. <br>
PICARD: Oh? <br>
TROI: In many ways he's suffering as badly as the boy. He wishes to
involve Jeremy in a Klingon ceremony called R'uustai, the Bonding <br>
PICARD: I know of that. Perhaps it will be helpful to both of them. <br>
TROI: I don't think Jeremy's ready to accept Worf right now. Perhaps
later, but it will have to be handled most delicately. <br>
PICARD: As you always do. I break the unpleasant news and there my
responsibility ends, but you, you have to stay with them through the
entire grieving process. <br>
TROI: We deal with our pain in many different ways, but over the years
I've discovered it is in our joy that the uniqueness of each individual

anti-matter, Captain. <br>
LAFORGE: I'd say they're running the manifestation off our own energy. <br>
PICARD: So there are limits to her power. <br>
RIKER: She needs the transporter to get the boy back. <br>
PICARD: So how do we cut the puppet's strings? <br>
LAFORGE: Increasing the shield harmonics to match our own antimatter
containment fields will probably sever the beam. <br>
PICARD: Proceed. <br>
RIKER: Deanna, stand by. <br>
TROI [OC]: Standing by.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARLA: It is only a matter of time, Captain, before
we can power the transporters ourselves <br>
PICARD: We? For whom else do you speak? <br>
MARLA: The accident on the surface was caused by a remnant of an
ancient and tragic era. Two species once shared this world. One of
energy and one of matter. The physical beings you call the Koinonians
destroyed themselves in unending, bitter wars. The surviving life forms
on this world will not tolerate any further suffering as a result of
that dishonourable past. So, they have made this possible. They have
made me possible. <br>
PICARD: I appreciate your motives, but his mother is dead. He must
learn to live with that. <br>
MARLA: I will be every bit his mother. <br>
PICARD: But not his mother. Picard to Lieutenant Worf. <br>
WORF [OC]: Go ahead, Captain. <br>
PICARD: Will you escort Ensign Crusher to the Aster quarters? <br>
WORF [OC]: Yes, sir. <br>
PICARD: Picard out. <br>
MARLA: Your philosophy is curious, Captain. What is so noble about
sorrow? I can provide him an
existence where he will feel no pain, no anguish. <br>
PICARD: It is at the heart of our nature to feel pain and joy. It is an
essential part of what makes us what we are. <br>
MARLA: He is alone now in your world. A child, alone. How can you know
he won't be happier with me? <br>
PICARD: For a brief moment in time, he surely would be. Any of us in
his place would be. <br>
TROI: What would Jeremy do for friends in your world? <br>
MARLA: He will have any friends he needs. <br>
TROI: And will you provide for his education, his health, his growth, a
career, a wife? <br>
PICARD: Yes, it's quite an undertaking you're proposing, isn't it? <br>
MARLA: It is our duty to make him happy again. <br>
PICARD: Do you honestly believe he would be happy in this total fiction
which you wish to create? What reason would he have to live? What
you're offering him is a memory, something to cherish, not to live in.
It is part of our life cycle that we accept the death of those we love.
Jeremy must come to terms with his grief. He must not cover it or hide
away from it. You see, we are mortal. Our time in this universe is
finite. That is one of the truths that all human must learn. <br>
WESLEY: Acting Ensign Crusher reporting as ordered, sir. <br>
PICARD: Yes. Come in, Wesley. Please stay, Lieutenant. Jeremy, Wesley's
father died on a Starfleet mission when he was younger than you are. <br>
TROI: Wes, your mother told me you were finding it difficult to talk to
Jeremy. Why is that? <br>
WESLEY: I don't know. I just didn't want to think about it any more.
All this has reminded me so much of that day. <br>
PICARD: The day I told you your father had been killed. As I recall,
Wesley, you took it very well. <br>
WESLEY: My parents taught me about the dangers of Starfleet missions. I
knew what could happen. <br>
PICARD: So you were prepared? <br>
WESLEY: No, I wasn't prepared at all. How could anyone be prepared to
hear that a parent is never coming home again? I tried to be what
everybody expected of me. Brave and mature. <br>
PICARD: Wesley, are you saying that you didn't want anybody to see what
you were really feeling? What were you really feeling? <br>
WESLEY: Like somebody had kicked me in the head. <br>
PICARD: Somebody? <br>
TROI: Go on. You've wanted to tell him for a long time. <br>
WESLEY: I was angry at you. <br>
PICARD: Why angry? Why were you angry at me, Wesley? Were you angry at
me because I was the one who told you your father was dead? <br>
WESLEY: No. <br>
PICARD: Then why? <br>
WESLEY: Because you led the mission. You came home and my father
didn't. <br>
TROI: How long were you angry with the Captain, Wes? <br>
WESLEY: For a long time. But not any more, sir. Not even a little. <br>
TROI: So, Jeremy, you must be very angry at Lieutenant Worf. He was in
charge of your mother's mission, just as Captain Picard was in command
when Wesley's father was killed. Isn't that right? Worf came back. Your
mother didn't. <br>
(Finally, Jeremy cries) <br>
JEREMY: Why? Why weren't you the one who died? Why did it have to be
her? <br>
TROI: He can't answer that. None of us can. <br>
PICARD: Lieutenant Worf also lost his parents. <br>
WORF: They were killed in battle when I was six. When I was alone,
humans helped me. Let me help you. The Marla Aster I knew and honoured
is not in this room. Nor does she await you on the planet. Now she
lives only here And here. (in their hearts) Join me in the R'uustai,
the Bonding. You will become part of my family now and for all time. We
will be brothers. <br>
(Marla goes up to Jeremy, then walks away. She and the house illusion
vanish. All is as it should be again)

candles. Then Worf puts a sash across Jeremy's shoulder) <br>
WORF: SoS jIH batlh SoH. <br>
JEREMY: What does that mean? <br>
WORF: It honours the memory of our mothers. We have bonded and our
families are stronger. <br>
JEREMY: SoS jIH batlh SoH. </font> </p>
