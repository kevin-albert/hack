Game. <br>
PARIS: Why don't we make it interesting this time. Let's add some table
stakes. <br>
KIM: What kind of stakes? <br>
PARIS: I don't know. Hmm. Couple of replicator rations, maybe? <br>
RICKY: Don't do it, Harry. He's hustling you. <br>
KIM: Wait a minute. Are you saying he deliberately let me win? <br>
PARIS: That would be dishonest, Harry. <br>
KIM: I won that game, and I'll beat you again. <br>
PARIS: How many rations are you willing to bet on that? <br>
CREWMEMBERS: Go for it, Harry. <br>
KIM: A week's worth. <br>
PARIS: Harry, Harry, Harry. Never, ever play with anyone, not even your
best friend, if he says let's make it interesting. You want a little
action, I'll give you a little action. How about an honest game of
chance? <br>
RICKY: Never play with anyone, even your best friend, if he offers you
an honest game of chance, Harry. <br>
PARIS: One replicator ration is all it takes to play, and the only
thing you have to do to win is pick a number. Just predict what the
radiogenic particle count will be at twelve hundred hours tomorrow, and
if you hit the pot is yours. Minus a small handling fee for the bank,
of course. <br>
CREWMAN: I'll take a piece of that. <br>
JONES: Jones. PARIS: Harry, get a PADD, take down these names and
numbers. <br>

Ensign Hogan, still no luck with the warp drive? <br>
HOGAN: No, Lieutenant. The manifold just won't fire up. We've finally
narrowed it down to some kind of a problem in EPS conduit one four one.
<br>
TORRES: Was there any indication yesterday that there was something
wrong? <br>
HOGAN: Suder was monitoring the EPS flow and the CCF. He says
everything was fine. <br>

Happy Kal Rekk, Mister Vulcan! <br>
TUVOK: The holiday of Kal Rekk is not for two weeks. <br>
NEELIX: But it's the Kal Rekk season. <br>
TUVOK: There is no Kal Rekk season. Kal Rekk is a day of atonement,
solitude and silence. <br>
NEELIX: Atonement. Solitude. All your Vulcan holidays are the same.
I've been doing some research, I know. <br>
TUVOK: Why would you need to do research on Vulcan holidays? <br>
NEELIX: It's part of my job as Morale officer. <br>
TUVOK: Morale is irrelevant to a Vulcan. <br>
NEELIX: Oh, please! There's no one on this ship requires my services
more than you do. I will not rest until I see you smile. <br>
TUVOK: Then you will not rest. <br>
NEELIX: I don't suppose you've ever heard of the Vulcan Rumarie? <br>
TUVOK: The Rumarie is an ancient pagan festival. <br>
NEELIX: Full of barely clothed Vulcan men and women covered in slippery
Rillan grease, chasing one another. <br>
TUVOK: That has not been observed for a millennium. <br>
NEELIX: Well, it's time to bring it back. <br>
TORRES [OC]: Lieutenant Tuvok, report to Engineering immediately. <br>
TUVOK: Acknowledged. <br>
NEELIX: I've been thinking of a Rumarie theme for the mess hall next
week. Lots of high fat, greasy foods, and if people want to take of
their clothes and chase one another, well, it certainly wouldn't hurt
morale around here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
Is there a problem, Lieutenant? <br>
(Torres indicates an open conduit. Inside are human remains.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH:
Ninety eight percent of his body suffered third degree plasma burns. If
the circuit hadn't failed, he would have been vaporised. <br>
TUVOK: It appeared that Mister Darwin entered the conduit to repair a
faulty circuit when the accident occurred. <br>
EMH: A perfectly good theory. Unfortunately it's wrong. This contusion
is the result of a hard blow to the back of the skull. <br>
TUVOK: Perhaps he fell and hit his head in the conduit. <br>
EMH: The coup contra-coup pattern of breakage should tell us if the
blow is the result of a moving head hitting a stationary object, or a
moving object hitting a stationary head. In this case the pattern
clearly indicates the latter. I'm sorry to report Crewman Darwin was
murdered. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Ready
room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
At first glance there is no obvious motive. Crewman Darwin didn't have
any known enemies on board. <br>
JANEWAY: I've been looking over his Starfleet record. His training
instructor recommended him as an Officers candidate. He turned it down
to come with us. He has three sisters back home. <br>
(Torres enters.) <br>
TORRES: Sorry I'm late. These are the duty logs from last night. Lon
Suder was the only one in Engineering when Frank Darwin came on duty. <br>
JANEWAY: Something wrong? <br>
CHAKOTAY: No, not really. I've just never really been comfortable with
Suder, that's all. It's not like he ever did anything wrong, it's just <br>
TORRES: As a Maquis, he did what he had to do a little too well. <br>
JANEWAY: As in? <br>
CHAKOTAY: As in killing Cardassians. <br>
TUVOK: I don't recall observing anything unusual about Mister Suder's
behaviour while I was on your ship. <br>
CHAKOTAY: You weren't with him in battle. Around us he was the
quietest, most unassuming guy you'll ever meet. Typical Betazoid, Kept
to himself. I never knew much about him. <br>
TORRES: In the Maquis, we didn't ask for resumes. We needed all the
help we could get. <br>
CHAKOTAY: A lot of us were doing what we were doing to protect our
families, but Suder had his own reasons. I wish I could tell you what
they were. In combat there was something in his eyes. <br>
JANEWAY: Maybe he had something personal against Cardassians? <br>
CHAKOTAY: Sometimes I had to pull him back, stop him from going too
far. And once or twice when I did he looked at me with those cold eyes
and I just knew he was this far away from killing me. <br>
TUVOK: I find it curious that none of this was included in your initial
crew evaluation, Commander. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I don't put down hunches or bad feelings in my crew
evaluations, Lieutenant. A Vulcan should appreciate that. <br>
TUVOK: Considering the fact that your Maquis crew included malcontents,
outlaws and mercenaries, I believe it would have been appropriate. <br>
CHAKOTAY: I wasn't going to make it harder for any of them here. Suder
did his job when he was serving with me and he's done his job since
he's been on this ship. <br>
JANEWAY: It seems clear where your investigation should begin,
Lieutenant. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Tuvok's
office]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> SUDER:
You wished to see me, Mister Tuvok? <br>
TUVOK: Sit down. You were alone in Engineering when Crewman Darwin
reported for duty last night. <br>
SUDER: Yes, sir. <br>
TUVOK: Did you speak to him? <br>
SUDER: No, we just sort of looked at each other and he did whatever he
had to do and I did what I had to do. <br>
TUVOK: And what was that? <br>
SUDER: I was running a fuel consumption analysis for Lieutenant Torres.
She can tell you. Are you accusing me of killing him? <br>
TUVOK: I have accused no one at this time. Did you kill Crewman Darwin?
<br>
SUDER: No. No, I barely knew him. You know, just because I'm a Maquis
doesn't make me a killer. <br>
TUVOK: I will be speaking to everyone in Engineering, perhaps everyone
on this ship, not just former members of the Maquis. <br>
SUDER: We all know how you feel about the Maquis. <br>
TUVOK: I assure you, I have no feelings about the Maquis. <br>
SUDER: No, you just spied on us and were going to turn us all over to
Starfleet. <br>
TUVOK: As hard as it may be for you to understand, that did not require
any feelings on my part. The Doctor places the time of death at twenty
two fourteen. Do you remember what you were doing then? <br>
SUDER: I was still running the fuel analysis. I worked on it until I
went off duty. <br>
TUVOK: Would you be surprised to know that your console was logged off
at twenty two oh nine? <br>
SUDER: That's not possible. <br>
TUVOK: Do you have a criminal record, Mister Suder? <br>
SUDER: Now that would be sort of difficult to check on, wouldn't it? <br>
TUVOK: Why would you have any reason to lie? <br>
SUDER: I don't. <br>
TUVOK: Do you have a criminal record? <br>
SUDER: No. <br>
TUVOK: How would you describe your relationship with Crewman Darwin? <br>
SUDER: I had no relationship. <br>
TUVOK: No disagreements? <br>
SUDER: No. <br>
TUVOK: No fights? <br>
SUDER: No. <br>
TUVOK: No reason to kill him? <br>
SUDER: No. <br>
TUVOK: You are dismissed, Crewman. I may have more questions for you
later. <br>
(Suder leaves.) <br>
EMH [OC]: Medlab to Lieutenant Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: Go ahead, Doctor. <br>
EMH [OC]: I think I've found something that will help you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH: Do
you see the DNA strands on the lower border? <br>
TUVOK: Yes. They were retrieved from inside the head wound by nanites
that I designed to recognise unusual DNA patterns. This DNA was
isolated because it didn't belong to the victim. <br>
TUVOK: Have you matched it to a member of the crew? <br>
(The EMH hands over a PADD.) <br>
TUVOK: Are you certain? <br>
EMH: DNA doesn't know how to lie, Lieutenant. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Suder's

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Suder
stares at the PADD.) <br>
TUVOK: I must advise you that under Starfleet Directive one zero one
you do not have to answer any questions. <br>
SUDER: No. No, there's no point in denying it anymore. I used a two
kilo coil spanner. He was sitting at the impulse system control panel.
Didn't even look up when I moved in behind him and I swung the spanner
as hard as I could. <br>
TUVOK: Crewman, I suggest you speak to counsel. <br>
SUDER: There was practically no blood. I was surprised at that. I
figured that the EPS conduit was the easiest way to dispose of the
body, but I must have damaged one of the circuits when I put him
inside. Oh, I hid the spanner behind a comm. line access panel on deck
seven. <br>
TUVOK: Why did you kill him, Mister Suder? <br>
SUDER: No reason. <br>
TUVOK: That is not a satisfactory answer. You must have had some
motive. <br>
SUDER: I didn't like the way he looked at me. <br>
(The Security guard takes Suder into custody.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (The
blood on the coil spanner has been analysed.) <br>
EMH: No doubt about it, this is the murder weapon. Mister Suder is
apparently telling the truth. You don't seem satisfied, Lieutenant. <br>
TUVOK: No. <br>
EMH: You have a confession and the murder weapon. <br>
TUVOK: And no established motive. <br>
EMH: Does it matter? <br>
TUVOK: Crime must have a logical purpose. <br>
EMH: Ah yes, I see. How to close the case without understanding the
logic of the crime. For a Vulcan, that would be a dilemma, wouldn't it.
<br>
TUVOK: Doctor, is it possible that Mister Suder is psychotic? <br>
EMH: I doubt it. Kes, call up his genetic profile. <br>
KES: The neurogenetic markers are normal. There's no tendency towards
bipolar disorder. <br>
EMH: So he's not insane, per se. What do the elevated norepinephrine
levels suggest? <br>
KES: Aggressive, even violent tendencies. <br>
TUVOK: Why didn't you report this immediately after your examination,
Doctor? <br>
EMH: These readings are not significantly different from those of the
other Maquis crewmen. Obviously it takes a certain personality type to
be attracted to the life of an outlaw. <br>
KES: Don't you believe his confession, Tuvok? <br>
TUVOK: In fact I do. Nevertheless, my job is not finished until I
determine a motive. <br>
EMH: And what if there was no motive? <br>
TUVOK: One may not recognise the motivation, but there is always
motivation. <br>
EMH: I think you are trapped in your own Vulcan logic, Lieutenant. All
of us have violent instincts. We have evolved from predators. Well, not
me, of course, I've just been programmed by you predators. The question
is, in a civilised world, can we suppress those instincts? Most of the
time we can. Vulcans certainly can. You've got your violent feelings
buried underneath centuries of control. But the rest of the humanoid
races aren't always so skilled at self-discipline. Crewman Suder may
have violent impulses that he just can't control. <br>
TUVOK: Do you believe that a look by Mister Darwin could provoke such a
violent reaction? <br>
EMH: It has been known to happen. <br>
TUVOK: I do not accept that explanation. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Brig]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> SUDER:
I already told you why I killed him, Lieutenant. <br>
TUVOK: You didn't like the way he looked at you. <br>
SUDER: Right. <br>
TUVOK: Just how did he look at you? <br>
SUDER: Like a lot of people in Starfleet do. <br>
TUVOK: So this murder could in fact be explained as an outburst of rage
against Starfleet. <br>
SUDER: Look, if that's how you want to look at this. <br>
TUVOK: I want the truth. <br>
SUDER: I don't like Starfleet, I won't deny that, but <br>
TUVOK: Yes? <br>
SUDER: I have killed people who weren't in Starfleet for the same
reason. I did not like the way they looked at me. I've thought about
killing you, Lieutenant. <br>
TUVOK: In my case, you have a motive. My previous mission as a spy, my
role as your accuser. But to my knowledge, Crewman Darwin had done
nothing to you. <br>
SUDER: That's true. <br>
TUVOK: Then why chose him as a victim? <br>
SUDER: I don't know. <br>
TUVOK: Do you feel remorse? <br>
SUDER: I don't seem to feel anything at all. Most Betazoids can sense
other people's emotions. I can't even sense my own. So what's going to
happen to me now? <br>
TUVOK: I'll have to discuss that with the Captain. <br>
SUDER: I know what I'd do if I were her. Guess I'm lucky. The
Federation doesn't execute people. <br>
(Tuvok leaves, and almost gets to the turbolift before he turns and
goes back again.) <br>
TUVOK: It is important that I understand why you killed Mister Darwin. <br>
SUDER: I wish I could help you, Lieutenant. <br>
TUVOK: You can. And indirectly I may be able to help you as well. Do
you know what a mind meld is? <br>
SUDER: It's that Vulcan thing where you grab someone's head. <br>
TUVOK: We would be telepathically linked, exchanging our thoughts. In
essence, becoming one mind. <br>
SUDER: One mind? You and me? I wouldn't recommend that, Lieutenant. <br>
TUVOK: It is not without risk, but as a Vulcan I have internal
processes that allow me to control violent instincts. I believe I will
be able to suppress whatever feelings I draw from you. <br>
SUDER: And how will I be helped by all this? <br>
TUVOK: It is likely that you will gain, at least for a time, some of my
self discipline to better control your violent nature. <br>
SUDER: What do I have to do? <br>
TUVOK: Release the forcefield. <br>
(Ayala draws his phaser then releases the cell forcefield. Tuvok
enters.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> TUVOK:
So it ultimately turned out to be a worthwhile and enlightening
experience. <br>
JANEWAY: Did you get any of the answers you were after? <br>
TUVOK: It is difficult for me to accept, Captain, but Mister Suder was
telling the truth as he knew it. He is a man with an incredibly violent
nature living in an environment without any outlet to express it. I am
surprised he was able to maintain his self control for as long as he
did. <br>
JANEWAY: I guess in his earlier life he always found ways to release
those impulses, like volunteering for the Maquis. What do we do with
him? <br>
TUVOK: If we were home, he'd be sent to prison. <br>
JANEWAY: The brig is the closest thing we have. But I don't think we
can just leave him down in our dungeon for the rest of the trip. <br>
TUVOK: Nor would it be appropriate to leave him in the custody of
someone in this quadrant. <br>
JANEWAY: I agree. <br>
TUVOK: Captain, he is prepared to die for his crime. <br>
JANEWAY: An execution? You're not seriously suggesting that we <br>
TUVOK: I only mention it because of the extenuating circumstances, and
because he feels it would be an appropriate punishment.<br>
JANEWAY: I don't. I prefer to rehabilitate him, not to end his life.
We'll confine him to quarters. Work with Kim to install maximum
security containment. <br>
TUVOK: Pardon me, Captain, but allowing him the comfort of his own
quarters doesn't seem an appropriate punishment for murder. <br>
JANEWAY: If we don't get home soon, he'll be in that room a long time,
Mister Tuvok. I think this is the best we can do under these
circumstances. <br>
TUVOK: Crewman Darwin's three sisters might not agree. <br>
JANEWAY: How is Suder since the mind meld? <br>
TUVOK: Quite calm and controlled. Clearly the meld initiated some high
cortical activity in his brain.<br>
JANEWAY: And you, Tuvok? Any adverse effects? <br>
TUVOK: I will admit that I am more disconcerted than I anticipated. <br>
JANEWAY: Why don't you take a day or two off for meditation. <br>
TUVOK: Thank you, but I am already taking steps to purge these residual
feelings. I don't believe time off will be necessary. I will of course
advise you of any further complications. <br>

really want me to leave, I'll leave. <br>
TUVOK: I really want you to leave. <br>
NEELIX: I don't believe you. Your voice says go away, but your heart
want me to make you smile. <br>

NEELIX: Come on. A little smile. How is it going to hurt? I won't tell
anyone. <br>

NEELIX: Come on, just a little itty bitty smile. Just let the mouth

I did not hear you come in, Lieutenant. <br>
TUVOK: How are you feeling? <br>
SUDER: Centred. <br>
TUVOK: Don't be misled. Your violent instincts still exist. You are
simply suppressing them as Vulcans do. <br>
SUDER: I can feel the difference. It is almost as if I can observe the
violence inside me without letting it get too close. It is quite
remarkable what you Vulcans have learnt to do. <br>
TUVOK: Understand that this will not be a permanent change unless you
commit to a strict daily regime of meditation and mental exercise. I
also believe that a series of holodeck programmes designed to allow
your violent tendencies to be released in a safe environment may help
to purge your aggressive impulses. <br>
SUDER: Holographic violence does not give the same sensation as the
real thing. I've tried it. <br>
TUVOK: Has anyone ever suggested targeted neurosynaptic therapy? <br>
SUDER: That didn't work either. <br>
TUVOK: Our Doctor is programmed with the medical knowledge of every
Federation world. Perhaps he'll know of some treatment you haven't
tried. <br>
SUDER: Since the meld, I feel capable of controlling myself. Perhaps
with your help I can learn to stay this way. It must be difficult for
you. <br>
TUVOK: Difficult? <br>
SUDER: Knowing violence as I've known it. <br>
TUVOK: I have studied violence for over a hundred years. <br>
SUDER: Studying it and knowing it are two different things, aren't
they. It's attractive, isn't it. <br>
TUVOK: Attractive? <br>
SUDER: Violence. <br>
TUVOK: On the contrary. I find it disturbing. <br>
SUDER: You're right, it is disturbing, never knowing when that impulse
may come or whether or not you can control it when it does. You live on
the edge of every moment, and yet, in it's own way, violence is
attractive, too. Maybe because it doesn't require logic. Perhaps that's
why it's so liberating. Ironic, isn't it, that I can share with you of
all people what I have hidden from everyone all my life. Can we do it
again, Tuvok? <br>
TUVOK: Again? <br>
SUDER: Meld. <br>
TUVOK: That would not be advisable. <br>
SUDER: I understand. Really, I do. I've thought about it a lot. In a
way, a mind meld is almost an act of violence, isn't it. <br>
TUVOK: I don't understand why you <br>

me that a mind meld might be fatal if you lost control. </font></p>

JANEWAY: Computer, lift the security seal from Lieutenant Tuvok's
quarters. (to guard) Wait here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Tuvok's
quarters]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (The
place has been smashed up. Tuvok is sitting in a corner in the dark.) <br>
TUVOK: I would advise you not to enter, Captain. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: Please, do not come any closer. <br>
JANEWAY: Talk to me. <br>
TUVOK: I said, don't come any closer. <br>
JANEWAY: We need to get you to Sickbay. <br>
TUVOK: It would be safer for the crew if I were to remain in these
quarters. I remind you, I am trained in the martial arts of many Alpha
quadrant cultures. Sitting here, attempting to meditate, I have counted
the number of ways I know of killing someone using just a finger, a
hand, a foot. I had reached ninety four when you entered. <br>
JANEWAY: The Doctor is fully versed in Vulcan medicine. <br>
TUVOK: Again, for safety reasons, I recommend you sedate me before you
initiate transport. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> (Tuvok
is lying on the biobed in the surgical bay, sedated and with cortical
blinkies on his temples.) <br>
KES: Levels of neuropeptides in the limbic systems are down fifteen
percent. <br>
EMH: There's a definite neurochemical imbalance in the mesiofrontal
cortex.<br>
JANEWAY: Which means what? <br>
EMH: That's where the Vulcan psycho-suppression systems are located.
This may be the result of an incompatibility with the Betazoid
telepathic neural centre, I'm not sure. <br>
(The EMH walks through the surgical bay forcefield.) <br>
EMH: Vulcan mind melds. Utter foolishness. Anybody with an ounce of
sense wouldn't share his brain with someone else. Would you? I
certainly wouldn't. And of course, when something goes wrong, and
believe me it does more often than they'd like to admit, the first
thing they call out is Doctor. <br>
JANEWAY: Can you help him? <br>
EMH: I wish I could tell you. There's a recommended course of
treatments that should begin immediately. <br>
JANEWAY: What does it involve? <br>
EMH: First we have to take away his ability to control his violence. We
do this in short bursts over a period of time and hope it provides a
shock to his system. If it works, his own neural controls will take
over again. I believe we're about ready. Revive him. <br>
TUVOK: Something has changed. <br>
EMH: We've temporarily removed all of your emotional suppression
abilities, Lieutenant. How do you feel? <br>
TUVOK: I feel. <br>
JANEWAY: Tuvok, do you know where you are? <br>
TUVOK: (laughs) Of course I know where I am, Captain. I'm just not sure
I know who I am. <br>
EMH: Try to relax. The treatment still has about three minutes to go. <br>
TUVOK: Oh, it must be working, because I feel very strong. Very
powerful. Quite euphoric. This must be how my ancestors felt. Doctor,
would you consider allowing me to remain this way for a while? It would
be a valuable opportunity for me to study primal Vulcan behaviour. <br>
EMH: Sorry, I'm not prepared to do that. The course of treatment is
very specific. <br>
TUVOK: You are not invulnerable, hologram. A few well chosen commands
to the computer and you will cease to exist. <br>
(Tuvok throws a wheelchair at the forcefield.) <br>
KES: Two minutes, thirty seconds left. <br>
TUVOK: You look shocked, Captain. You must be asking yourself, what if
this doesn't work? What do we do then? I have an idea. I'll just stay
in my quarters for the rest of the trip. I'll just relax and read, eat
the ship's food, use the ship's energy, all in the comforts of my own
room. Why, even Mister Suder and I could get together for a few hands
of Cardassian pinochle once or twice a week. That is how we treat
violent offenders on this ship, isn't it? <br>
JANEWAY: You are not a violent offender, Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: I could be. Just like Suder. You know, Captain, I don't mind
telling you something the other Tuvok never would. You are wrong.
Sparing Suder's life is a sign of weakness. You disgust me. All you
humans do. Admit it! Part of you feels as I do. Part of you wants him
to die for what he did. <br>
JANEWAY: No part of me feels that way. <br>
TUVOK: Liar! He has killed and you know he deserves to die! On behalf
of the victim's family, Captain, I beg you to reconsider. Give them the
satisfaction of his execution. I have a radical suggestion, Captain.
Release the forcefield and I'll kill him for you. Release the
forcefield. (to Kes) My student, my protégée. there is so much for each
of us to learn today, isn't there. <br>
KES: You'll be all right, Tuvok. This'll be over in thirty seconds. <br>
TUVOK: Listen to what I tell you. Release the forcefield. <br>
KES: I'm sorry. I had them disable your telepathic abilities too. You
can't reach me, Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: Release the forcefield! <br>
(Tuvok tries to push his hand through the forcefield.) <br>
EMH: Ten seconds. Five seconds. <br>
(Tuvok collapses.)<br>
EMH: It's over. <br>
KES: He's lost consciousness. <br>
EMH: He might be able to fool the sensors. Sedate him again. Computer,
remove the forcefield. <br>
JANEWAY: Help me get him back on the bed. How many treatments do you
think will be necessary? <br>
EMH: I wish I knew, Captain. In a sense, Mister Tuvok's mind is
fighting a classic battle between good and evil. The battle may be won
in a day, a year, or it may never be won. </font></p>

wakes up in Sickbay, alone and bathed in sweat. The forcefield is still
there. He pulls off the blinkies then dismantles one to help him pull
an EPS cable from the wall. He uses it to short out the forcefield.
Ayala is dealt with quickly in the Brig.) <br>
SUDER: Tuvok? I wondered what happened to you. They wouldn't tell me
anything. <br>
TUVOK: There were some complications from the meld. <br>
SUDER: I wondered about that.<br>
TUVOK: I've been undergoing neurosynaptic therapy in Sickbay. <br>
SUDER: It didn't work. <br>
TUVOK: No. <br>
SUDER: Have you come to kill me? <br>
TUVOK: To execute you for your crime. <br>
SUDER: To execute me. I see. And calling it that makes it more
comfortable for you. <br>
TUVOK: I will take no comfort in this. <br>
SUDER: A most logical use of violence, to punish the violent. <br>
(Tuvok lowers the cell forcefield.) <br>
SUDER: We both know that I am prepared to die, but are you prepared to
kill? <br>
TUVOK: It needs to be done. <br>
SUDER: To release your violent impulses? <br>
TUVOK: To serve justice. <br>
SUDER: Justice or vengeance? Understand one thing, Tuvok. I can promise
you this will not silent your demons. If you can't control the
violence, the violence controls you. Be prepared to yield your entire
being to it, to sacrifice your place in civilised life for you will no
longer be a part of it, and there's no return. <br>
(Tuvok grabs Suder's head.) <br>
TUVOK: I seek no return! <br>
SUDER: Of course, you would not be able to live with yourself. Then we
are both to die, and that will end the torment. <br>
TUVOK: My mind to your mind. My thoughts to your thoughts. My mind to
your mind, my thoughts to your thoughts. <br>
(They sink to their knees, and finally Tuvok releases him before
collapsing. Suder rolls him over and uses his comm. badge.) <br>
SUDER: Crewman Suder to the Bridge. <br>
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Suder, what are you doing with a comm. badge? <br>
SUDER: You'd better get down here, Chakotay. Lieutenant Tuvok needs
help. </font></p>

Captain's log, supplemental. Ensign Suder has been incarcerated in
secured quarters where he will likely spend the rest of our journey

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> EMH: It
may be hard for you to believe, Lieutenant, but what happened is
encouraging. Your inability to complete the act of murder shows your
suppression system in starting to function again. You're on your way
back to being normal, although I'm not sure how the word normal applies
to a species that suppresses all their emotions. <br>
TUVOK: Captain, I must apologise for my inappropriate behaviour. <br>
JANEWAY: I'm just glad we have you back, Mister Tuvok. <br>
TUVOK: I was most insulting to you. <br>
JANEWAY: Don't worry about it. I've been insulted before. <br>
TUVOK: I hope you understand that I have always had the greatest
respect for you as a Captain, and consider you a friend. <br>
JANEWAY: That means a great deal to me. Enough said. Get some rest.
Tuvok. No more mind melds without my permission. Understood? </font>
