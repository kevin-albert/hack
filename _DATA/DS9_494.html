SISKO: Kasidy Yates, where are you going? <br>
KASIDY: Down to my ship. I have a meeting with my engineer. Go back to

SISKO: You're the captain. He'll wait. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EDDINGTON: This briefing will contain information
considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not
share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It
seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons
inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks
ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the
Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial
replicators. And that request has been granted. <br>
DAX: How many replicators are we talking about? <br>
EDDINGTON: Twelve, all class four. <br>
KIRA: The Federation only gave Bajor two CFI replicators. <br>
EDDINGTON: With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons
have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian
worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building
new power plants and factories. <br>
DAX: Why all the secrecy? <br>
EDDINGTON: Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop
the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. <br>
SISKO: It makes sense. The Cardassian military has been so busy fending
off the Klingons, they've basically given a free hand to the Maquis in
the Demilitarised zone. The last thing the Maquis are going to want to
see is a shipment of replicators on its way to Cardassia. <br>
EDDINGTON: Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone
between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing
terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built
several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are
getting worried. <br>
WORF: They should be. Without the Cardassian military to stop them, the
Maquis have a perfect opportunity to drive the Cardassians out of the
DMZ permanently. <br>
SISKO: I take it this shipment is going to pass through Deep Space
Nine? <br>
EDDINGTON: Yes, sir. In three days. <br>
SISKO: All right. Let's tighten security on the station. Step up random
checks of incoming and outgoing cargo for weapons or explosives, more
deputies on the Promenade. You know the drill. <br>
ODO: Understood. <br>
SISKO: Mister Worf, tomorrow I want you to take the Defiant and patrol
the Badlands. Show the flag. Let the Maquis know we're ready for any
trouble. <br>
WORF: Aye, sir. <br>
SISKO: Mister Eddington, I want daily briefings on this until the
replicators are in Cardassian hands. <br>
EDDINGTON: Aye, sir. <br>
SISKO: Dismissed. <br>
(Dax, Worf and Kira leave.) <br>
ODO: The Commander and I would like to have a word with you. <br>
SISKO: Something wrong? <br>
EDDINGTON: Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a
Maquis smuggler here on the station. <br>
SISKO: Oh? <br>
ODO: It's just a theory at this point and frankly, our suspicions are
based on purely circumstantial evidence. <br>
SISKO: Who is it? <br>
EDDINGTON: Again, we're still not certain. <br>
SISKO: I understand that. Who? Gentlemen? <br>
ODO: Kasidy Yates. <br>
(After the titles, when this stunning piece of news has sunk in.) <br>
SISKO: Kasidy? Working for the Maquis? That's impossible. <br>
ODO: I certainly hope so. Smuggling with intent to supply a terrorist
organization is a serious offence. <br>
SISKO: Where's your evidence? <br>
ODO: Five months ago, Captain Yates was hired by the Bajorans to carry
cargo to their outlying colonies. One of her regular runs is from Bajor
to a colony on Dreon Seven. It's a twelve hour run for most ships, but
she always takes eighteen. The six hour difference is just enough time
to allow her to make a side trip into the Badlands, rendezvous with a
Maquis ship and then continue on to the Dreon System. <br>
SISKO: That's your evidence? That she was slow in one of her
deliveries? <br>
EDDINGTON: There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of
the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the
Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their
contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. <br>
ODO: And Captain Yates has been living aboard the station for just
under six months. <br>
SISKO: That's damned slim evidence to base an accusation. <br>
ODO: We haven't made accusations. I said we have suspicions. <br>
SISKO: That's right. You did say that. <br>
ODO: Captain, I realise this is an awkward situation for you, but if I
could step up my surveillance of Captain Yates? <br>
SISKO: Odo, she's a Federation citizen. You can't just invade her
privacy based on your suspicions. You'll have to show me some real
evidence before I authorise what you're proposing. <br>
EDDINGTON: If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation
citizen. <br>
SISKO: The answer is no. <br>
EDDINGTON: Understood, sir. <br>
(Odo and Eddington head for the door.) <br>
SISKO: Gentlemen. There are times we have to search vessels docked at
the station. If you can find a reason. <br>
ODO: We'll let you know.

A player thumps the opponent into the wall then scores the winning
shot.) <br>
BASHIR: Yeah, Nerys! There you go! Did you see that? The way she gave
him the tiniest head fake and then boom, checked him into the wall. <br>
GARAK: Yes, it was quite effective. <br>
(But Garak is watching Ziyal, not the match.) <br>
BASHIR: Stop watching her. <br>
GARAK: Oh, I thought the whole point was to watch. <br>
BASHIR: The point is to watch the game, not the spectators. Especially
not that spectator. <br>
GARAK: What does she expect? She's the only Cardassian woman on this
station. She must know she's bound to attract some attention. <br>
(Kira ends up in the wall this time.) <br>
BASHIR: Some, yes. Yours, no. (Kira get's tripped.) Oh, come on! That
was a foul! <br>
(Still on the floor, Kira catches the ball in her hand.) <br>
GARAK: Perhaps I should say hello after the game. <br>
BASHIR: That's Gul Dukat's daughter, and I can't think of anyone in the
galaxy who hates you more than he does. Besides, Ziyal is a friend of
Kira's. I wouldn't play around with her if I were you. <br>
GARAK: I simply thought it would be polite to say hello. But clearly,
you think I'm incapable of conducting any kind of pleasant discourse
without some kind of nefarious ulterior motive. <br>
BASHIR: That's not what I meant. I just think you should leave well
enough alone. Why stir up <br>
GARAK: Yes! Well played! Brava, Major! <br>
BASHIR: What happened? <br>
GARAK: A brilliant move on the part of the Major. You should have been
paying attention.

KASIDY: Did you know you could smell that all the way down the

SISKO: It's an experiment. Bajoran ratamba stew over spinach linguine. <br>
KASIDY: Don't your neighbours ever complain? <br>
SISKO: Sometimes, but usually it's only an excuse to get a taste of my
cooking. <br>
KASIDY: Oh, how sneaky of them. <br>
SISKO: Yes, they're a duplicitous bunch. <br>
(Jake walks in on a kiss.) <br>
JAKE: All right, you two, break it up. I've got a problem. Do either of
you know what a Kavarian tiger-bat smells like? It's for a story I'm
working on. The computer database has plenty of pictures, but no
olfactory information. <br>
SISKO: You're a writer. Make something up. <br>
JAKE: I'm going for a real 'you are there' feeling. The details have to
be right. Kas, haven't you been to Kavaria? <br>
KASIDY: Not me. Sorry. <br>
SISKO: Don't you make a regular cargo run to a neighbouring system? <br>
KASIDY: No, Kavaria's out toward the Badlands. I try to stay away from
there. You should ask Quark. I bet he knows someone who's been out that
way. <br>
SISKO: I thought you made deliveries to Dreon Seven. That's near the
Badlands, isn't it? <br>
KASIDY: I guess it depends on how you define near. On my ship, Dreon's
a long way from the Badlands. <br>
SISKO: What route do you take to the Dreon System? I imagine you go
around the Rolor Nebula. <br>
KASIDY: If you're really this interested in my flight plans, why don't
you look them up. You are the Commander of the station, after all. <br>
SISKO: Forget I brought it up. Okay, everyone grab a plate and prepare
to be dazzled. <br>

make a strategic withdrawal at the first sign of trouble, but there
doesn't seem to be a way out of here. <br>
ZIYAL: You could always call security. <br>
GARAK: Oh, true. But it would take them a few minutes to arrive, and by
then it might be too late. <br>
ZIYAL: I don't think I'll hurt you. <br>

KASIDY: What is going on here? <br>
ODO: Captain, we need to make a class two inspection of your cargo
before we can allow you to leave the station. <br>
KASIDY: Inspection? For what? <br>
ODO: Temecklian virus. There've been some reports of an outbreak on
Bajor, so we're scanning all ships and cargo before they leave the
system. <br>
KASIDY: None of my cargo came from Bajor. <br>
ODO: I'm afraid the rules are very strict. No exceptions. <br>

take six hours, but I need to make a rendezvous with a Tholian
freighter in nine hours and you know how they are about punctuality. <br>

SISKO: Stand by. Is there any way we can make a shorter inspection? <br>
EDDINGTON: Not if they're going to search for contraband while they
make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for
camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. <br>
SISKO: We probably shouldn't bother at this point. If Kasidy's in a
hurry, she'll going to be standing over their shoulders the whole time.
They won't be able to make much of a search. <br>
EDDINGTON: Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. <br>
SISKO: You are clear to leave the station. Just remember to irradiate
that cargo. <br>
KASIDY [on monitor]: Thanks, Ben. I owe you one. See you tomorrow. <br>
SISKO: Do you have something to say, Commander? <br>
EDDINGTON: No, sir. <br>
SISKO: Good. Now, get down to the Defiant and tell Worf he has a change
of orders. I want you to follow the Xhosa. <br>
EDDINGTON: Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates
meeting a Maquis ship? <br>

O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. <br>
(A little later the Xhosa goes into the plasma storms of the Badlands.)
<br>
O'BRIEN: Say what you will about the Maquis, they're not stupid. Using
the Badlands as their base of operations was a pretty smart move. Not
to mention gutsy one. <br>
WORF: They are terrorists, little more than criminals. And criminals
always make mistakes. <br>
O'BRIEN: They're just fighting for something they believe in. <br>
WORF: They should be hunted down and destroyed. <br>
O'BRIEN: What for? Defending their homes? Look at what's happened to
those people. One day they're trying to eke out a living on some
godforsaken colonies on the Cardassian border, the next day the
Federation makes a treaty handing those colonies over to the
Cardassians. What would you do? <br>
WORF: I would not become a terrorist. It would be dishonourable. <br>
O'BRIEN: I wouldn't say that around Major Kira if I were you. How about
you, Commander? How do you feel about the Maquis? <br>
EDDINGTON: I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. <br>
O'BRIEN: Oh, but you must have an opinion. <br>
EDDINGTON: I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll
find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion
is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet
officer. Anything else is an indulgence. <br>
O'BRIEN: I think I've got something. An impulse signature off the
starboard bow. <br>
WORF: Bring us within visual range. <br>

QUARK: Can't you do something about these lapels? <br>

QUARK: I don't know, I'm not a tailor. Just make them look good. <br>
GARAK: Oh, make them look good. And all this time I thought you wanted
me to try to make them look bad. I wish you'd said that before. It's so
much simpler when the customer explains what he wants. <br>
QUARK: Rudeness will get you nowhere. I don't need another waiter. Now,
I want more room in the shoulders and these cuffs are completely
unacceptable. <br>
KIRA: Garak, can I talk to you for a minute? <br>
GARAK: Of course, Major. Excuse me. <br>
QUARK: Sure.<br>
GARAK: Now, what can I do for you, Major? <br>
(Kira slams Garak into the wall) <br>

playing with Ziyal, but it'd better stop and it better stop right now. <br>
GARAK: I can assure you, Major, I have <br>
KIRA: I don't want to hear any of your lies. Now, that girl is here
under my protection and I swear if you do anything to hurt her, I will
make you regret it. Is that clear? <br>
GARAK: As Tabalian glass. <br>
KIRA: Good. <br>
(Kira leaves) <br>
QUARK: You told her. The pants are about a metre too long. So, are you
cancelling your date with Ziyal? <br>
GARAK: It's not a date. And how do you know about that? <br>
QUARK: You're a man, she's a woman, it's a date. And they are my
holosuites, after all. <br>
GARAK: I was going to cancel. I've had visions of Ziyal presenting my
head to her father as a birthday gift. <br>
QUARK: That's a little paranoid, wouldn't you say? <br>
GARAK: Paranoid is what they call people who imagine threats against
their life. I have threats against my life. But after my little chat
with Major Kira, I feel much better. <br>
QUARK: You do? <br>
GARAK: Isn't it obvious? If Ziyal planned to kill me, Kira would not be
trying to warn me away. On the contrary, the good Major would also
welcome my untimely demise, and do nothing to interfere. <br>
QUARK: Unless that's part of the plan. <br>
GARAK: What do you mean? <br>
QUARK: Oh, you know. Kira acts like she doesn't want you to go so
you'll feel everything's okay, and then you go anyway. Nah, it's too
complicated. <br>
GARAK: Of course. <br>
QUARK: Now they're too short. <br>

If your contact doesn't show up for a rendezvous, you leave. You don't
stay in the Badlands going in circles for five hours. <br>
WORF: Perhaps. But it is also possible that her cargo is so valuable to
the Maquis that she will wait as long as it takes to make the delivery.
<br>
ODO: I think she's already made her delivery, and you were the cargo.
Think about it. If anyone but Kasidy Yates was on the Xhosa, would you
be commanding this mission yourself? <br>

SISKO: Don't say it. I know that you're a smuggler. I know that you've
been working with the Maquis, and right now I don't care. But I need to
know what your orders were. Were you told to draw me out here so the

KASIDY: Ben, I <br>
SISKO: Jake's back there. And whatever your feelings are for me, I
can't believe you would put him in danger. <br>
KASIDY: I was supposed to meet a Maquis ship at these coordinates. I
don't know anything about an attack on the station, and I doubt the
Maquis would try. I didn't know you were following me, but after our
last talk, I suspected that you might be out there. <br>
ODO: If that's true, why didn't you abort the mission? <br>
KASIDY: I was told that these medical supplies were urgently needed and
that I had to be here no matter what. I tried to tell them that I'd
made too many runs in the past few days, that I was just asking to get
caught, but they wouldn't listen. <br>
SISKO: They knew you were going to be caught. That's why they didn't
send a Maquis ship here to meet you. Everything's been building to
this. They needed to draw me away from the station. Why? If they aren't
planning an attack, what other reason could there be? What could be
happening (penny drops) Happening on the station?

to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to
know about it. <br>

EDDINGTON [on monitor]: Will knowing my personal motivation change
anything at this point? <br>
SISKO: No, I don't suppose it will. <br>
EDDINGTON [on monitor]: Then let's table that for now. The only reason
I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with
the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise
you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. <br>
SISKO: Unless you see another shipment you want to hijack. <br>
EDDINGTON [on monitor]: You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and
you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. <br>
SISKO: I don't respond well to threats. I thought you would know that
by now. But I'm beginning to see that you don't know me at all. <br>
EDDINGTON [on monitor]: I know you. I was like you once, but then I
opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so
obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're
constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us
through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed.
Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you
can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the
Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only
sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful
place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse
than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for
assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they
don't even know it. <br>
SISKO: You know what, Mister Eddington? I don't give a damn what you
think of the Federation, the Maquis, or anything else. All I know is
that you betrayed your oath, your duty, and me. And if it takes me the
rest of my life, I will see you standing before a court-martial that'll
break you and send you to a penal colony, where you will spend the rest
of your days growing old and wondering whether a ship full of
replicators was really worth it. </font></p>

GARAK: Why am I here? Am I to believe that you've invited the sworn
enemy of your father simply to enjoy the heat? <br>
ZIYAL: You really think I asked you here to kill you? Well, it did
occur to me. Kira and my father both told me that you used to be an
agent of the Obsidian Order. That you had my grandfather tortured and
killed, and that you could easily kill me without a second thought. <br>
GARAK: Although I seldom credit the Major or your father with being
entirely trustworthy, in this case they're both telling the truth. <br>
ZIYAL: You know what else is true? I don't care. I'm half-Bajoran and
that means I'm an outcast back home. I can't go back and neither can
you. So we can either share some time together or we can ignore each
other. I spent five years in a prisoner of war camp by myself. I don't
need your company. But if you'd like to stay and share the heat with
me, maybe tell me something about home that I don't know, then I would
welcome your company. And I get the feeling you would welcome mine.
Either way, it's up to you. <br>
